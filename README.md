# Discover Daily Backend

## What It Is

This is the backend for [Discover Daily](https://letsdiscoverdaily.com), a platform that provides kid-friendly news articles. It handles data scraping, filtering, and sharing articles via an API on the front end.

## What It Does

- **Scrapes News Articles**: Collects articles from online sources.
- **Filters Content**: Uses a simple word blacklist to classify articles as kid-friendly or not.
- **Provides an API**: Offers endpoints to fetch articles.

## Next Steps

2. **Expand Sources**: Add more news sources for broader coverage.
3. **Optimize Performance**: Refactor code for better scalability and speed.
4. **Add Features**: Include options for article tagging and topic-specific filtering.
