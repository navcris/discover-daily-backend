            "Brain activity is shown in gold (artist\u2019s illustration). A newly approved antipsychotic achieves its effects by activating brain proteins called muscarinic receptors.Credit: Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library",
            "The first schizophrenia medication in decades with a new mechanism of action won US regulatory approval today. The approval offers the hope of an antipsychotic that would be more effective and better tolerated than current therapies.",
            "The drug, known as KarXT, targets proteins in the brain known as muscarinic receptors, which relay neurotransmitter signals between neurons and other cells. Activating these receptors dampens the release of the chemical dopamine, a nervous-system messenger that is central to the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions.",
            "\n\nPruning hypothesis comes of age\n",
            "But muscarinic signalling also modulates other brain circuits involved in cognition and emotional processing. This mode of action provides KarXT with a more comprehensive therapeutic effect than other schizophrenia treatments, which mainly blunt dopamine activity alone.",
            "In clinical trials, KarXT not only alleviated core symptoms of schizophrenia, but also showed signs of improving cognitive function, all while avoiding many of the burdensome side effects commonly associated with older antipsychotics.",
            "\u201cThis will be a revolution of the treatment of psychosis, and I\u2019m not saying this lightly,\u201d says Christoph Correll, a psychiatrist at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell in Hempstead, New York, who helped to analyse data from the trials. \u201cNow we will now be able to treat people who haven\u2019t been helped with traditional antipsychotics. That\u2019s highly exciting.\u201d",
            "h2Hope for tailored treatment",
            "KarXT is just the first of many next-generation drug candidates designed to engage muscarinic receptors in the brain. Several follow-on schizophrenia therapies are already in or nearing clinical trials, showing promise for improved tolerability and more convenient dosing schedules.",
            "This progress is leading clinicians and drug developers to imagine a future in which schizophrenia treatment becomes more tailored to individual needs \u2014 providing an alternative for the many people who don\u2019t benefit from current therapies or abandon them owing to intolerable side effects.",
            "\u201cThis provides an option that is completely outside the toolbox that we have right now,\u201d says Ann Shinn, a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, who has no commercial ties to KarXT.",
            "h2From rejection to revival",
            "KarXT traces its roots back to early 1990s, when researchers at Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, began developing xanomeline \u2014 a muscarinic-activating agent designed mainly to boost memory in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but it has been explored as a potential treatment for schizophrenia, too.",
            "Trials showed that the drug offered both antipsychotic and cognitive benefits1,2. But xanomeline also caused nausea, vomiting and stomach pain \u2014 because muscarinic receptors are active in the gut as well as the brain \u2014 leading Lilly to ultimately shelve the drug.",
            "*A_coloured_PET_brain_scan_of_a_schizophrenic_patient_during_hallucination,_with_activity_highlighted",
            "Flashes of activity (red and yellow; artificially coloured) light up the brain of a person having hallucinations caused by schizophrenia.Credit: Wellcome Centre Human Neuroimaging/Science Photo Library",
            "Years later, biotech executive Andrew Miller devised a strategy to revive the therapy. He recognized that administering the muscarinic-activating agent together with another compound that blocks xanomeline\u2019s effects outside the brain could maintain the cognitive and antipsychotic benefits without causing severe gastrointestinal distress.",
            "In 2009, Miller formed a company called Karuna Therapeutics, based in Boston, Massachusetts. Karuna combined xanomeline with a drug called trospium. This well-understood molecule blocks muscarinic receptors and does not cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, meaning that it selectively prevents side effects in the gut without interfering with xanomeline\u2019s action in the brain.",
            "Thus KarXT was born.",
            "In clinical trials, the two-in-one pill outperformed a placebo in relieving characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia3,4, without the weight gain, sedation or movement issues that are commonly associated with existing antipsychotics. The side effects of KarXT were largely limited to gut disturbances, which tended to resolve after a week or two of daily use.",
            "There were also strong signs of cognitive benefit, with preliminary indications5 that KarXT might also help to mitigate symptoms such as blunted affect and lack of motivation. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging,\u201d Stephen Marder, a psychiatrist at the University of California, Los Angeles, says of these ancillary effects. (Marder assisted with some of the analyses). But these effects need to be verified in a \u201cfocused study,\u201d he says.",
            "h2High price",
            "The drug has a few shortcomings. For one, it requires twice-daily administration, and studies indicate that more frequent dosing schedules are linked to higher rates of non-adherence and treatment discontinuation in people with schizophrenia6. \u201cThat\u2019s a big limitation,\u201d says Nate Sutera, a psychiatric pharmacist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha \u2014 particularly because many antipsychotics are now available as long-acting injectables, requiring only a few doses annually.",
            "KarXT also comes with an anticipated price tag of roughly US$20,000 per year7, raising concerns among health economists about its cost-effectiveness compared with alternatives. Despite this, most industry analysts predict strong demand, with peak annual sales projected in the billions. This potential drove Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) in Princeton, New Jersey, to acquire Karuna for approximately $14 billion this year.",
            "\n\nFirst genomic study of schizophrenia in African people turns up broken genes\n",
            "Other drug makers are likewise seeing the value of targeting muscarinic receptors, pursuing various strategies to improve on the profile of KarXT. Some are developing formulations with more convenient dosing schedules. Others are focused on greater target selectivity, aiming to design molecules that activate only specific muscarinic receptors \u2014 either the M1 receptor, linked to cognitive benefits, or the M4 receptor, which underpins antipsychotic effects, but not both, as KarXT does.",
            "One such drug candidate, an M4-selective agent called emraclidine, seems to offer antipsychotic effects similar to those of KarXT, with improved tolerability, although it offers potentially fewer cognitive benefits, according to early clinical testing8.",
            "Former Karuna chief executive Steven Paul, a psychiatrist now at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, welcomes the wave of innovation in targeting muscarinic signalling that KarXT helped to unleash \u2014 and he looks forward to discovering the best ways to harness this therapeutic strategy.",
            "\u201cNow we have new biology and new pharmacology to explore,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be fun and scientifically relevant \u2014 and, hopefully, clinically beneficial to patients \u2014 to find out.\u201d",

            "A 25-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes started producing her own insulin less than three months after receiving a transplant of reprogrammed stem cells1. She is the first person with the disease to be treated using cells that were extracted from her own body.",
            "\u201cI can eat sugar now,\u201d said the woman, who lives in Tianjin, on a call with Nature. It has been more than a year since the transplant, and, she says, \u201cI enjoy eating everything \u2014 especially hotpot.\u201d The woman asked to remain anonymous to protect her privacy.",
            "James Shapiro, a transplant surgeon and researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says the results of the surgery are stunning. \u201cThey\u2019ve completely reversed diabetes in the patient, who was requiring substantial amounts of insulin beforehand.\u201d",
            "The study, published in Cell today, follows results from a separate group in Shanghai, China, who reported in April that they had successfully transplanted insulin-producing islets into the liver of a 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes2. The islets were also derived from reprogrammed stem cells taken from the man\u2019s own body and he has since stopped taking insulin.",
            "The studies are among a handful of pioneering trials using stem cells to treat diabetes, which affects close to half a billion people worldwide. Most of them have type 2 diabetes, in which the body doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin or its ability to use the hormone diminishes. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks islet cells in the pancreas.",
            "Islet transplants can treat the disease, but there aren\u2019t enough donors to meet the growing demand, and recipients must use immune-suppressing drugs to prevent the body from rejecting the donor tissue.",
            "Stem cells can be used to grow any tissue in the body and can be cultured indefinitely in the laboratory, which means they potentially offer a limitless source of pancreatic tissue. By using tissue made from a person\u2019s own cells, researchers also hope to avoid the need for immunosuppressants.",
            "h2Reprogrammed cells",
            "In the first trial of its kind, Deng Hongkui, a cell biologist at Peking University in Beijing, and his colleagues extracted cells from three people with type 1 diabetes and reverted them into a pluripotent state, from which they could be moulded into any cell type in the body. This reprogramming technique was first developed by Shinya Yamanaka at Kyoto University in Japan almost two decades ago. But Deng and his colleagues modified the technique3: instead of introducing proteins that trigger gene expression, as Yamanaka had done, they exposed the cells to small molecules. This offered more control over the process.",
            "The researchers then used the chemically induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to generate 3D clusters of islets. They tested the safety and efficacy of the cells in mice and non-human primates.",
            "In June 2023, in an operation that lasted less than half an hour, they injected the equivalent of roughly 1.5 million islets into the woman\u2019s abdominal muscles \u2014 a new site for islet transplants. Most islet transplants are injected into the liver, where the cells cannot be observed. But by placing them in the abdomen, the researchers could monitor the cells using magnetic resonance imaging, and potentially remove them if needed.",
            "h2Insulin free",
            "Two-and-a-half months later, the woman was producing enough insulin to live without needing top-ups, and she has sustained that level of production for more than a year. By that time, the woman had stopped experiencing the dangerous spikes and drops in blood glucose levels, which remained within a target range for more than 98% of the day. \u201cThat\u2019s remarkable,\u201d says Daisuke Yabe, a diabetes researcher at Kyoto University. \u201cIf this is applicable to other patients, it\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u201d",
            "The results are intriguing, but they need to be replicated in more people, says Jay Skyler, an endocrinologist at the University of Miami, Florida, who studies type 1 diabetes. Skyler also wants to see that the woman\u2019s cells continue to produce insulin for up to five years, before considering her \u2018cured\u2019.",
            "Deng says the results for the other two participants are \u201calso very positive\u201d, and they will reach the one-year mark in November, after which he hopes to expand the trial to another 10 or 20 individuals.",
            "Because the woman was already receiving immunosuppressants for a previous liver transplant, the researchers could not assess whether the iPS cells reduced the risk of rejection of the graft.",
            "Even if the body doesn\u2019t reject the transplant because it doesn\u2019t consider the cells to be \u2018foreign\u2019, in people with type 1 diabetes, because they have an autoimmune condition, there is still a risk that the body could attack the islets. Deng says they didn\u2019t see this in the woman because of the immunosuppressants, but they are trying to develop cells that can evade this autoimmune response.",
            "h2Donor cells",
            "Transplants using the recipient\u2019s own cells have advantages, but the procedures are difficult to scale up and commercialize, say researchers. Several groups have started trials of islet cells created using donor stem cells.",
            "Preliminary results for one trial, led by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts, were reported in June. A dozen participants with type 1 diabetes received islets derived from donated embryonic stem cells that were injected into the liver. They were all treated with immunosuppressants. Three months after the transplant, all the participants began producing insulin when glucose was present in their bloodstreams4. Some had become insulin independent.",
            "Last year, Vertex launched another trial in which islet cells derived from donated stem cells were placed in a device designed to protect them from immune-system attacks. It was transplanted into a person with type 1 diabetes, who did not receive immunosuppressants. \u201cThat trial is ongoing,\u201d says Shapiro, who is involved in the study, which aims to enrol 17 individuals.",
            "Yabe is also about to start a trial using islet cells produced using donor iPS cells. He plans to develop sheets of islets and surgically place them in the abdominal tissue of three people with type 1 diabetes, who will receive immunosuppressants. The first participant should receive their transplant early next year.",

            "The world\u2019s largest telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which is based in Australia and South Africa, is changing its plans and will not be expanding into eight African countries on its original timetable.",
            "In August, SKA director-general Philip Diamond said in a briefing at the International Astronomical Union\u2019s general assembly in Cape Town, that the observatory\u2019s plans had \u201cevolved\u201d. The project will be unable to fund a large expansion into other countries on the original timescale that had been agreed on when the project's main sites were selected in 2012.",
            "Diamond told Nature that \u201cthe ability to go from the current funding to another large monolithic phase of the project is probably just impractical. What we\u2019re looking at now is much more of a phased, continual deployment.\u201d",
            "Pontsho Maruping, managing director of the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) in Cape Town, says that this will not affect the scientific scope of the project, but that the timing of its goals will depend on the availability of funding. \u201cAs soon as more funding is committed, more infrastructure will be deployed, including remote stations,\u201d she says.",
            "Nature's news team contacted the African Astronomical Society, based in Cape Town, and the Ghana Space Science and Technology Institute in Accra, to ask whether the changes would lead to a loss in research capacity in some African nations. They referred enquiries to the SARAO and the SKA Observatory global headquarters (SKAO), near Manchester, UK.",
            "Whether the telescope will ever reach its target 'square kilometre' is not clear. Diamond said that it will not happen during his tenure as director-general. \u201cIt\u2019s for future leaders to take us there.\u201d",
            "h2First images",
            "SKA telescopes are interferometers, in which multiple dishes or antennas act as a single telescope. Together, they collect radio signals emitted by celestial objects. Astronomers hope that the array will shed light on some of the most enigmatic problems in astronomy, such as how galaxies form, the nature of dark matter and whether there is life on other planets.",
            "So far, the SKAO has secured \u20ac2.1 billion (US$2.3 billion) from its ten official members: Australia, Canada, China, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
            "This funding covers the first ten years of the telescope\u2019s construction and operation (2021\u201330), accounting for roughly 10% of the planned dishes and antennas. This includes 197 three-storey mid-frequency dishes in South Africa and 131,072 low-frequency antennas in western Australia, grouped into smaller arrays. Both telescopes \u2014 called SKA-Mid and SKA-Low \u2014 have produced their first images.",
            "A second phase, with a starting date of 2020, was meant to comprise around 2,000 radio dishes in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia, along with South Africa, and a total of one million antennas in Australia. The total collecting area would be around one square kilometre, hence the name.",
            "h2Enter Botswana",
            "Maruping says that the SKAO\u2019s decision to delay the second phase \u201cdoes not stop us partnering with African partner countries and SKA members to deliver astronomy infrastructure as appropriate\u201d.",
            "For example, next year, Botswana, one of the eight partner countries, will get its first SKA dish through a collaboration with South Africa and Germany, with a funding arrangement outside of the initial SKA plan.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a game-changer for the science in Botswana,\u201d says Kgomotso Thelo, a project manager at the Botswana International University of Science and Technology (BIUST) in Palapye. \u201cWe\u2019ll begin to have those astronomers working on the data that's generated from their own telescope.\u201d",
            "The Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany, and the German Center for Astrophysics in G\u00f6rlitz are contributing the dish hardware, costing about \u20ac6 million. Meanwhile, Botswana is providing local support and covering infrastructure costs and South Africa is supplying other components, says Michael Kramer, an astronomer and director of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy.",
            "The Max Planck Society, along with South Africa's government and the Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte in Naples, Italy, are currently funding the addition of 14 dishes to South Africa\u2019s 64-dish MeerKAT telescope, which will ultimately be incorporated into the SKA.",
            "Similarly, the Botswana dish will also be incorporated into SKA. \u201cThe construction and operation of the dish will be the first significant astronomical facility to be sited in Botswana,\u201d says Michael Bode, an emeritus professor of astrophysics at Liverpool John Moores University, UK.",
            "Botswana has just a handful of professional astronomers, Thelo says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough road ahead, but if you\u2019ve got partners who have done it before, it makes it much easier for us,\u201d he adds.",

            "Scientists, some of whom spoke to Nature on the condition of anonymity because they fear retribution from the government, say that Venezuelan research was already censored and underfunded before the election, but that they anticipate things will get even worse. They point to a bill passed by Maduro\u2019s administration last month that regulates non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which some researchers rely on for funding or to help publish their research. This latest chapter in Maduro\u2019s reign could spell the end for independent science in the country, they say.",

However, that number is an overestimate because it includes anyone who has a degree and staff who clean and maintain laboratories, says Requena, who has been monitoring the number of scientists in the country. In 2004, when science in Venezuela was more stable, there were only about 7,100 scientists actively engaged in research in the country, says Requena, who is a member of the Venezuelan Academy of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences.",
            "Because the science ministry no longer publishes clear, reliable information on its spending, Requena assesses research output in scientific journals as an indicator of the health of Venezuelan science. An as-yet unpublished analysis that he carried out last year suggests that there are now, at most, 1,200 still-active scientists.",

The country\u2019s gross domestic product fell from about US$373 billion at its peak in 2012 to about $44 billion at its lowest point in 2020 and has now recovered slightly to $106 billion. National science funding is around 0.3\u20130.4% of that (the average for countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is 2.7%). Nearly 8 million people \u2014 about one-quarter of Venezuela's population \u2014 are estimated to have fled to avoid violence, hunger and poverty.",

Mar\u00eda Eugenia Grillet, a 64-year-old biologist who studies the epidemiology of mosquito-borne diseases, moved to Colombia in December 2023 to avoid power outages and to be able to conduct research freely, among other factors.

            "Most chemical bonds in molecules are made up of a single pair of electrons, shared between atoms. These are called covalent single bonds. In particularly strong bonds, atoms might share two electron pairs in a double bond, or three pairs \u2014 a triple bond. But chemists know that atoms interact in many other ways, and by studying more unusual bond types at the boundaries of the possible, they hope to better understand what a chemical bond is in the first place.",

            "The concept of single-electron covalent bonds dates to 1931, when chemist Linus Pauling proposed them. But at the time, chemists didn\u2019t have the tools to observe such bonds, says Marc-Etienne Moret, a chemist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Even with modern analytical techniques, these bonds are challenging to observe. \u201cThe situation in which only one electron makes a bond is very unstable,\u201d says Moret. \u201cThis means the bond will break easily and have a strong tendency to either release or capture an electron to restore an even number of electrons.\u201d",
            "In 1998, scientists observed2 a single-electron bond between two phosphorus atoms; Moret was part of a group that created3 one between copper and boron in 2013. Chemists have theorized that these unusual bonds might occur between carbon atoms in short-lived intermediate structures that appear during chemical reactions. But to observe these fickle bonds, chemists have to stabilize a compound that contains them. A stable compound that contains a one-electron C\u2013C bond had eluded chemists.",
            "Shimajiri says the key to observing the single-electron carbon bond was carefully designing a molecule that would stabilize it. The research team, which included Hokkaido University chemist Yusuke Ishigaki, created a molecule that provides a stable \u2018shell\u2019 of fused carbon rings that helps hold together the carbon\u2013carbon bond in its centre. That central bond is stretched out to a relatively long length for a C\u2013C bond, which makes it susceptible to losing one electron in an oxidation reaction, creating the elusive single-electron bond.",

When the oxidation is performed in the presence of iodine, the reaction yields a purple salt, with the stable shell of the molecule holding together the single-electron C\u2013C bond inside. They then used various analytical techniques to characterize the molecule and the bond. Shimajiri says the compound is extremely stable under ambient conditions.",
            "\u201cIn several chemical reactions, the involvement of one-electron bonds has been proposed, but so far, they have remained hypothetical,\u201d says Shimajiri.

This species\u2019 legs were narrower and didn\u2019t have papillae, suggesting that legginess and tasting ability had evolved separately.",

When the researchers used the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene-editing tool to mutate tbx3a in some P. carolinus, the fish lost their papillae and the ability to dig for food.",
            "Tbx3a encodes a type of protein known as a transcription factor. A single transcription factor often regulates the activity of an array of genes, allowing it to have widespread effects. Bellono and Kingsley say that it\u2019s clear that tbx3a plays some part in leg development and taste perception. But the scientists add that they don\u2019t yet know which mutation caused tbx3a activity to change in species with sensory legs or how it created the fishes\u2019 new abilities.

            "Pollution could partially explain why the molluscs aren\u2019t multiplying on their own at every site. After it rains, a combination of raw sewage and stormwater is piped into the harbour. Lingering industrial waste contributes to poor water quality. Noise pollution could also be interfering with the larvae\u2019s ability to find a suitable place to settle, because they use auditory clues to locate existing reefs, Ventura says.",
            "Ray Grizzle, a marine biologist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, who has done scientific assessments for the project, says that juvenile oysters mostly settle within 400 metres of their parent reef. As a result, oysters might not self-seed readily at sites far from existing reefs.",
            "Grizzle\u2019s greatest concern is how pathogens, such as the parasites Haplosporidium nelsoni and Perkinsus marinus, might affect oysters over the long term. \u201cThey\u2019re down to about a 3- to 5-year lifespan now, when historically it was probably 10 to 20,\u201d he says. When the lifespan is reduced, so is the population\u2019s ability to form lasting vertical reef structures, he says. All the same, the project is \u201cmoving in a good direction\u201d, Grizzle says.",

            "Other restoration projects are taking off around the world. In Australia, biologists attracted oysters simply by dropping limestone boulders onto a sandy sea bed. Larval flat oysters (Ostrea angasi) naturally settled on the rocks in densities that far exceeded expectations2, suggesting the larvae are travelling from unknown remnant reefs or oyster farms.",
            "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know we were going to get any natural recruitment when we started,\u201d says study co-author Dominic McAfee, a marine biologist at the University of Adelaide in Australia. The effort is meant to sustain the seafood industry and has increased the biodiversity of invertebrates at the site.",
            "In the North Sea, researchers are placing oyster larvae on the granite boulders at the base of wind turbines in an effort to fortify the structures and increase biodiversity.",
            "Bishop says that for oyster-reef projects to be successful, they need to be located in areas where the issues that led to their demise are no longer present, constructed to withstand predicted changes to the ecosystem and monitored for much longer than two to three years. Although there is a long way to go, \u201cthere is a lot of hope\u201d, she says.",

            "A study of newer, bigger versions of three major artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots shows that they are more inclined to generate wrong answers than to admit ignorance. The assessment also found that people aren\u2019t great at spotting the bad answers.",
            "\n\nAI models fed AI-generated data quickly spew nonsense\n",
            "Plenty of attention has been given to the fact that the large language models (LLMs) used to power chatbots sometimes get things wrong or \u2018hallucinate\u2019 strange responses to queries. Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo at the Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Spain and his colleagues analysed such errors to see how they are changing as the models are getting bigger \u2014 making use of more training data, involving more parameters or decision-making nodes and gobbling up more computing power. They also tracked whether the likelihood of errors matches up to human perceptions of question difficulty, and how well people can identify the wrong answers. The study1 was published in Nature on 25 September.",
            "The team found that bigger, more-refined versions of LLMs are, as expected, more accurate, thanks in large part to having been shaped with fine-tuning methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback. That is good news. But they are less reliable: among all the non-accurate responses, the fraction of wrong answers has increased, the team reports, because the models are less likely to avoid answering a question \u2014 for example, by saying they don\u2019t know, or by changing the subject.",
            "\u201cThey are answering almost everything these days. And that means more correct, but also more incorrect\u201d answers, says Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo. In other words, the chatbots\u2019 tendency to offer opinions beyond their own knowledge has increased. \u201cThat looks to me like what we would call bullshitting,\u201d says Mike Hicks, a philosopher of science and technology at the University of Glasgow, UK, who proposes the term bullshit to describe the phenomenon2. \u201cIt\u2019s getting better at pretending to be knowledgeable.\u201d",

            "They tested the models on thousands of prompts that included questions on arithmetic, anagrams, geography and science, as well as prompts that tested the bots\u2019 ability to transform information, such as putting a list in alphabetical order. They also ranked the human-perceived difficulty of the questions \u2014 for example, a question about Toronto, Canada, was ranked as easier than a question about the lesser-known and smaller town of Akil, Mexico.",

            "As expected, the accuracy of the answers increased as the refined models became larger and decreased as the questions got harder. And although it might be prudent for models to avoid answering very difficult questions, the researchers found no strong trend in this direction. Instead, some models, such as GPT-4, answered almost everything. The fraction of wrong answers among those that were either incorrect or avoided rose as the models got bigger, and reached more than 60%, for several refined models.",
            "The team also found that all the models would occasionally get even easy questions wrong, meaning there is no \u2018safe operating region\u2019 in which a user can have high confidence in the answers.",
            "The team then asked people to rank the answers as correct, incorrect or avoidant. People incorrectly classified inaccurate answers as being accurate surprisingly often \u2014 roughly between 10% and 40% of the time \u2014 across easy and difficult questions. \u201cHumans are not able to supervise these models,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo.",

            "Making chatbots more inclined to answer tricky questions looks impressive and does well on leaderboards that rank performance, says Hern\u00e1ndez-Orallo, but isn\u2019t always helpful. \u201cI\u2019m still very surprised that recent versions of some of these models, including o1 from OpenAI, you can ask them to multiply two very long numbers, and you get an answer, and the answer is incorrect,\u201d he says. That should be fixable, he adds. \u201cYou can put a threshold, and when the question is challenging, [get the chatbot to] say, \u2018no, I don\u2019t know\u2019.\u201d",

All AI companies are working hard to reduce hallucinations, and chatbots developed for specific purposes, such as medical use, are sometimes refined even further to prevent them from going beyond their knowledge base.

            "Climate change is expected to speed up stratospheric circulation. In the future, that could cause the stratosphere to poke into the troposphere more frequently. If it does, stratospheric intrusion may become even more important in forming new particles, Wang says.",

In this science project, you will study a simple example of the last type of instrument: a narrow-necked bottle partially filled with water.",
            "How do musical instruments make the sounds that they do? All sound is made by vibrations. The vibrations push and pull on air molecules, changing the air pressure around them. The pushes cause a local compression of the air (increase in air pressure), and the pulls cause a local rarefaction of the air (decrease in air pressure). The compressions and rarefactions are rapidly transmitted through the air from the original source as a wave and are commonly called a sound wave. In summary, sound itself is a wave, a pattern, of changing air pressures.",

This is measured in\u00a0hertz, or cycles per second. On average, the frequency range for human hearing is from 20\u00a0hertz at the low end to 20,000\u00a0hertz at the high end. Figure 2 shows examples of sound waves of two different frequencies. The\u00a0period\u00a0in the wave is the time that it takes for a single cycle of the wave to pass.

These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",
            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "fCCan you see the three faces in this image? Most people can easily find them. Most people also realize that they aren\u2019t real faces. They are an example of pareidolia.",
            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",

            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

And those interactions depend \u201cdepend on the ability of the brain to monitor and control movement.\u201d",

Its overall length spans just over four times the body length of a fruit fly \u2014 about 2 millimeters (0.08 inch). To prevent the critters from flying away, researchers trimmed the flies\u2019 wings. A glass chamber coated with slippery Rain-X surrounded the treadmill. It limited the flies\u2019 ability to wall-walk. When the treadmill was on, the only floor available was a moving one.",
            "On the treadmill, the flies moved as they normally do. Most of the time, they quickly ran to the front of the treadmill. Then they stopped and rode its traveling belt back to the end. As their abdomens then nicked the back of the chamber, the startled flies sprinted forward again.",

He\u2019s confident the flies can go even faster (though the researchers didn\u2019t thoroughly test this).",

            "As the flies ran faster, their bodies moved higher. They rose up on their tiptoes, or \u201ctippy-tarsi,\u201d as Pratt says. He\u2019s referring to flies\u2019 leg parts that move somewhat like human feet.",
            "The flies treadmills could be modified to have two different belts. These treadmills could force each side of the insect\u2019s body to move at a different speed. The flies\u2019 middle legs compensated for this odd arrangement, the tests showed. The flies adjust their step distances to keep moving straight ahead. This change in stepping is akin to how a fly might handle a sudden gust of wind from one side. They would turn into the wind by changing the stride on the opposite side.",

            "The treadmill doesn\u2019t allow scientists to record what\u2019s going on in the flies\u2019 brains as they move. That would be a valuable bit of data, Chiappe says. It could show how brain cells spring into action as the flies walk, run or adjust their stride.",
            "Other test systems allow more detailed glimpses into the brain of a moving fly. This includes spheres on which tethered flies can walk. But those systems don\u2019t allow the fly to move as naturally as the Seattle team\u2019s treadmill does.",
            "In addition to producing insights on movement, the treadmill experiments sparked some friendly competition, Pratt says. \u201cThere was a point where we were like, \u2018Can we find the most athletic fly?\u2019 We started going down a rabbit hole,\u201d he says. \u201cWe even did a side project where we did endurance training in flies.

            "By accident, researchers stumbled on a new way to give jeans their iconic blue hue. The light-driven process could help dye denim with fewer harsh chemicals.\u00a0",
            "Denim is usually dyed with indigo. But this compound doesn\u2019t easily dissolve in water. So harsh chemicals are used to break it down into a liquid that can turn the fabric blue.\u00a0Each year, tens of thousands of tons of these harsh chemicals go into making denim across the world. Many are then dumped as waste into streams.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very toxic to both the environment [and] also the workers,\u201d says Katrine Qvortrup. She\u2019s a chemist at Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.",
            "Denim-dyeing chemicals can harm fish. They also pose health risks to workers who must use them. Formaldehyde is just one of the potentially cancer-causing chemicals that denim-makers use. So Qvortrup and her colleagues wanted to find a safer way to make jeans blue.\u00a0",
            "For their new dyeing technique, the researchers chose to use indican. It\u2019s the substance in indigo plants from which natural indigo dye is made. And unlike indigo, indican does dissolve in water. That means using it directly requires fewer harsh chemicals.",
            "In the past, others have used bacteria to make indican. But this only worked for producing small batches. To make enough for the big denim industry, the Danish team needed a new way. Their solution: Tweak an indican-producing enzyme found in indigo plants. This enzyme can make enough indican for factory-scale production, the researchers say.",
            "Their first idea was to mix indican with a second enzyme that would convert it to indigo. Then they dipped yarn in this liquid solution. It worked \u2014 the yarn turned blue within a few minutes.",
            "This sped-up video shows denim developing color over 40 minutes after being soaked in an enzyme solution.",
            "But the team also dipped some yarn in indican alone, without the second enzyme. A few of these samples got left on a windowsill in their lab. And to their surprise, these \u201cwere just turning blue without us doing anything,\u201d says Ditte Hededam Welner. \u201cWe were like, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d Welner is a biochemist on the team.",
            "It turns out that sunlight reacted with the indican on the yarn, converting it to indigo.",
            "How? The light turned a substance in the indican into a radical. A radical is a molecule with unpaired outer electrons, which primes it to bond to other molecules. Once turned into radicals, indoxyl molecules can bond with each other to form indigo.",
            "The team dipped more yarn in an indican solution, again with no enzyme. Then, they exposed the mix to various light sources. \u201cVery slowly, over the next couple of hours, [the yarn] will turn blue, and more and more blue,\u201d Welner says. \u201cThe light will develop the color.\u201d",
            "Light from the sun, from LEDs and even from household light bulbs can do this.\u00a0In fact, light can dye denim even darker than the enzyme method could using the same amount of indican.",
            "The researchers shared their discovery February 27 in Nature Communications.",
            "Using indican as a dye \u2014 with either an enzyme or light \u2014 would reduce the environmental harm from denim dyeing, the researchers say.",
            "They calculated the impact of each method using factors such as the materials involved, wastes produced and more. They looked at things such as carbon dioxide emissions and worker exposures to toxic chemicals.",
            "The enzyme-based method seems most promising. It could cut the harmful impacts by more than 90 percent, compared to normal denim dyeing, the scientists estimate.",
            "Light-driven dyeing is also less harmful than current methods, though not by quite as much. It might cut the impacts of dyeing denim by more than 70 percent. But the light method might take up less space than the enzyme method \u2014 and use less land. And if the researchers can cut electricity costs by dyeing with just sunlight, not bulbs, the light method may prove even better for the environment.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Using indican instead of indigo may be much better for the environment in some ways, says Robert Vos. He\u2019s a sustainability scientist who did not take part in the new project. Vos works at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But, he notes, the new dyeing methods still use lots of water. And this is a concern because a lot of water also goes into growing the cotton used to make denim.",
            "Both of the new indican-dyeing methods will require more testing before either can be used in factories. But at least cost shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Even with the cost of materials, such as LED lights, the light method may not raise the cost of denim dyeing at all, Qvortrup estimates. The enzyme method should cost only a few cents more per pair of jeans.",
            "That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to develop sustainable jeans [just] for the rich people,\u201d Qvortrup says. \u201cOur aim is to help to make it a cleaner process and not as polluting.\u201d",
            "Welner hopes these methods will have an impact even before they reach factories. Simply learning about more sustainable ways to make jeans may make denim-wearers think about where their clothes come from, she says. \u201cIf you want to wear blue denim,\u201d she says, \u201cbe aware that there are better ways to make it\u201d than are used right now."

            "A shooting star is normally a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it event. That space rock, or meteor, leaves a fiery trail of light as it zips through the atmosphere. Then it\u2019s gone. But sometimes, a lasting afterglow remains for minutes. For more than a century, astronomers have wondered why some meteors leave such \u201cpersistent trains.\u201d Now, they at last may have the answer.\u00a0",
            "To leave a lasting trail, meteors need to aim low. Space rocks that fall to about 90 kilometers (56 miles) above the ground before burning up boast lasting afterglows. But those that burn up higher in the atmosphere don\u2019t. These data come from a new survey of persistent meteor trains. Astronomers shared their new findings in the July issue of\u202fJournal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.\u00a0",
            "Amateur astronomers often record such trails \u201cas a nice movie,\u201d says Gunter Stober. This astrophysicist, who works at the University of Bern in Switzerland, did not take part in the new meteor survey. He concludes that it\u2019s \u201creally the first more comprehensive, total overview of [shooting star observations].\u201d\u00a0",
            "Persistent trains form when metals that have burned off an incoming space rock react chemically with a form of oxygen \u2014 ozone (O3) \u2014 in the air. These O3 reactions give off heat and light. These can keep a meteor train aglow for up to an hour.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Studies in the 1940s and 1950s suggested that such trains were rare. Only one in every 750 meteors was thought to produce one. And persistent trains were mostly associated with the brightest shooting stars.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "More recent studies have focused on the\u202fLeonid meteor storms in the early 2000s. Those were the most dramatic such showers in decades. Only the fastest meteors leave trains, these studies found. These were space rocks zinging through the air at speeds of around 70 kilometers (43 miles) per second.\u00a0",
            "But such surveys had their limits. Some were too broad, including one-off views of meteors from observers around the world. Others were too narrow; they might focus on just one spectacular meteor shower.\u00a0",

            "In that time, the camera saw nearly 7,500 meteors. About 850 of them \u2014 around one in every eight meteors \u2014 left persistent trains. One in 19 meteors left trains lasting more than five minutes.\u00a0",
            "That was surprising for two reasons. First, way more of the shooting stars left persistent trains than had been expected. Second, the meteors leaving those trains had all sorts of speeds and brightnesses.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Previously, many scientists had held that \u201cthese persistent trains were only formed by the fast, bright meteors,\u201d says Logan Cordonnier. He\u2019s an astrophysicist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \u201cWe found that it doesn\u2019t need to be fast,\u201d the new survey\u2019s leader says. In fact, he notes, \u201cMost of the persistent trains were formed by slower meteors.\u201d\u00a0",
            "The real factor that determined whether a shooting star left a lasting train was ozone, he says.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Meteors that zipped down to altitudes of 90 kilometers were far more likely to leave trains than those that burned up higher in the atmosphere. That key altitude of 90 kilometers is above the ozone layer in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. There is a little ozone at that height, Cordonnier says, just not nearly as much as below it.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In theory, meteors passing through the ozone layer, below, could also leave trails. But few make it that far down without burning up completely.\u00a0",

The structure\u2019s stone platforms get smaller as they rise from the ground. The six levels stand roughly 62 meters (200 feet) tall in the Saqqara necropolis. That\u2019s a vast ancient burial ground in northern Egypt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

Builders would have controlled flows of water into and out of a large shaft inside the pyramid. The water\u2019s movement would have lifted and lowered a platform that carried building stones to higher levels.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists shared this idea August 5 in\u00a0PLOS ONE. The team was led by Xavier Landreau. He has a background in materials science and physics. He also founded a private research institute known as the Paleotechnic to study ancient technologies. It\u2019s in Paris, France.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Scholars have proposed several techniques \u2014 including ramps and cranes \u2014 to move such hefty stone blocks. Scientists have also thought about rope-and-pulley devices and\u202frolling wooden rods attached to stones.\u00a0",
            "Other studies have hinted that water played some role in building pyramids. ",
            "Earlier this year, researchers reported a newfound Nile tributary.\u202f(A tributary is a freshwater stream that feeds into a larger river.) This stream borders a chain of 31 pyramids, including Djoser\u2019s. It\u2019s dried up now. But boats carrying workers and building blocks could have traveled this branch of the Nile between 3,700 and 4,700 years ago. They might have docked near to sites where the pyramids now stand.\u00a0",
            "But water likely played an even bigger part in building Egypt\u2019s first pyramid, Landreau says. Designers of Djoser\u2019s pyramid devised techniques for controlling water flow, he now argues. This field of knowledge is known as hydraulics.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The proposed hydraulic system is based on a computer model. That model included data on features inside the pyramid and on a network of underground tunnels at the site. The team also added detailed satellite images of the region. These all helped to model ancient rainfall and runoff levels.\u00a0",
            "In addition to the pyramid itself, the model also included a walled enclosure several hundred meters (yards) away. Known as Gisr el-Mudir, this structure was first described in the 1700s. But its exact purpose has long been a puzzle.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In the new model, Gisr el-Mudir would have captured floodwater that flowed through desert channels during heavy rains. Structures in the walls of the enclosure fed the water to a basin just west of Djoser\u2019s burial grounds. Periods of intense rain may have temporarily turned that basin into a lake. Such a lake would have then drained into a section of a limestone trench around the burial complex. That trench is now known as the Dry Moat.\u00a0",
            "Water from the Dry Moat could have entered two large shafts. One was a north shaft inside the pyramid. Granite chambers near the bottom of both shafts contained stone plugs. When removed, water could rush in.\u00a0",
            "Landreau\u2019s group thinks the north shaft is the framework for a water-powered lift. They think a huge wooden float rested above its granite chamber. That float would have been attached to long ropes. These ropes could have passed over pulleys at the top of the shaft before looping around to attach to a lift platform. ",

That water was then sent to a shaft inside the first ancient Egyptian pyramid (far right). The shaft may have served as an elevator to lift stones during the pyramid\u2019s construction.",
            "Workers hauling building stones could have gotten onto the lift platform at ground level. Or they might have gotten on through a tunnel several meters above ground level.\u00a0",
            "As water filled the shaft through the granite chamber, the float would rise and the platform descend. Water would be shut off when the platform reached the loading area. After placing tons of stones on the platform, the shaft would be drained. Then, as the float descended, it pulled on the ropes. And that yanked the platform and its cargo up to new construction levels.\u00a0",
            "Researchers not involved with the study find the water power idea intriguing. But they are not convinced that pyramid builders ever used it.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "One skeptic is Oren Siegel. He\u2019s an archaeologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. Gisr el-Mudir could not have held enough water from occasional rains to maintain this hydraulic system, he argues. Instead, Siegel thinks Gisr el-Mudir may have been an early experiment. It could have been used to test the building of stone enclosures like those that would later, on a larger scale, surround pharaohs\u2019 burial sites.\u00a0",
            "Kamil Kuraszkiewicz has doubts about something else: the proposed lake. It\u2019s not mentioned in any ancient Egyptian writings. He suspects it may never have existed. Kuraszkiewicz is an Egyptologist in Poland at the University of Warsaw.\u00a0",

            "Not all scientists are convinced by the new numbers. Among them is Du\u0161an Materi\u0107. He\u2019s an analytical scientist. He heads a research group that studies micro- and nanoplastics at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research. It\u2019s in Leipzig, Germany.",
            "Materi\u0107 is working to create standard methods to test for nanoplastics. They don\u2019t exist yet, he says. Such new methods will have to be scientifically sound. Without that, there\u2019s no way to truly know how many particles are there. What\u2019s more, he adds, it\u2019s easy to contaminate samples. When this happens there\u2019s no telling where the polluting bits might have come from. Were they already in the water? Did they come from a researcher\u2019s lab?",
            "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence. Using it to identify the plastic bits, as the Columbia team did, can be another source of error, Materi\u0107 says. The new algorithm may be prone to \u201cfalse positives,\u201d he says \u2014 where other things are mistaken for plastic. This would exaggerate how many plastic bits were present.",
            "More standardization is needed here, agrees Kurunthachalam Kannan. He\u2019s an environmental chemist who has studied microplastics. He works at New York State\u2019s Department of Health in Albany. Without a standardized way to test for micro- or nanoplastics, results from different labs can\u2019t be compared in terms of their number or size, he points out.",
            "But whether the water holds 10 pieces of nanoplastics or 100,000, one thing is certain \u2014 they\u2019re there. And one big question remains: What are their health impacts?",
            "These nano-scale bits are very, very small, notes Phoebe Stapleton. She\u2019s a toxicologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. She also is part of the team that measured them in water. Bits this size can be breathed in. From the lungs they could pass into the blood. Or, if consumed, they could pass into the blood from the gut, says Stapleton.",
            "Once in the blood, the tiny bits can move throughout the body, reaching cells anywhere.",
            "Rain can wash nanoplastics from the air and onto plants, including farm crops. Scientists found some plants absorb these tiny plastics. In fact, eating leafy plants is yet another pathway for these tiny plastics to enter the body. It\u2019s something two researchers at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing described. They mentioned this in a January 3 commentary in Environmental Science & Technology Letters.",
            "But are these nano bits harmful? Past studies placed nanoplastic bits directly onto cells to study their impacts. That caused some toxicity and cancer-causing changes, Stapleton notes. But scientists don\u2019t yet know what happens when the exposure is to the whole body.",
            "\u201cWe know they get in,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cSo really, the question is about that toxicity\u201d \u2014 what harm they might cause to us. She plans to investigate that.",

            "\u201cDehydration probably causes more [health risks] than exposure to nanoplastics,\u201d adds Yan. So don\u2019t hesitate to drink bottled water if that\u2019s all you have. However, past studies have shown tap water contains fewer plastic bits than bottled water.",
            "\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re exposed to so many plastic particles from different sources is the reality we have right now,\u201d notes Qian. But we can limit this pollution by reducing, reusing and recycling plastics. We can also look for using alternatives to plastics."

            "Writing things out by hand might seem boring and slow. But handwriting can boost links across brain regions. That includes some with roles in learning and memory. The new finding adds to growing evidence of handwriting\u2019s benefits.",
            "Scientists snooped on the brain activity of college students who wrote by hand or typed words. Compared with when they typed, more of the students\u2019 brain regions worked together when students scribbled with a pen. This trend also showed up in brainwaves \u2014 patterns of electrical activity \u2014 that have been linked with forming memories. That might mean writing notes by hand could boost memory of the material for a test, for instance.",
            "Previous research had shown that handwriting improves spelling and the ability to remember what you\u2019ve learned. Handwriting also strengthens the understanding of concepts. Scientists think that the slow process of tracing out letters and words gives people more time to process material and learn it.",
            "This new study hints at why handwriting seems so good for memory. \u201cThere is a fundamental difference in brain organization for handwriting, as opposed to typing,\u201d says Ramesh Balasubramaniam. A neuroscientist, he works at the University of California, Merced. He did not take part in the new work.",
            "Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel are psychologists. They study the human mind at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. The pair recruited college students for their new study. They showed students a word on a computer screen, then asked them to type or handwrite it in cursive with a digital pen. All the while, sensors in caps they wore recorded electrical activity in their brains.",

The team was looking for different brain regions whose waves were in sync. When those waves have the same frequency at the same time, it hints at how strongly the areas are linked while working on some task.\u00a0",

Some of those central brain areas play a role in memory. The findings suggest these brain areas join forces during handwriting in a way that they don\u2019t during typing.",

That\u2019s because certain brainwaves that get a boost play a role in making and storing memories.",
            "The team did not test whether the students remembered the words they wrote or typed. So it\u2019s not yet clear how the increased brain activity affects learning, says Kathleen Arnold. A psychologist, she works at Radford University in Virginia. More study is needed on the differences in brain linkages and whether they align with how well people learn.",

            "Handwriting may aid learning. But typing is often easier, faster and more practical. So students and teachers alike should decide, based on the task, whether to write it out or type, van der Meer says. For example, using handwriting to take notes might help you hang on to information, while typing an essay could help you get ideas down to the page faster, before you forget them.",

            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",

It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. ",
            "Today Taiwan\u2019s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan\u2019s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. ",
            "It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent.\n",

In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan\u2019s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC.",

Oung described two major blackouts \u2014 one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge.\n",
            "BQTaiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, leaving it vulnerable to both price fluctuations and blockade by China. ",
            "Nicholas Chen argues that government is failing to keep up even with existing demand. \u201cIn the past eight years there have been four major power outages,\u201d he said, and \u201cbrownouts are commonplace.\u201d ",
            "The operating margin on the grid \u2014 the buffer between supply and demand \u2014 ought to be 25 percent in a secure system. In Taiwan, Oung explained, there have been several occasions this year when the margin was down to 5 percent. \u201cIt shows that the system is fragile,\u201d she said. ",
            "Taiwan\u2019s current energy mix illustrates the scale of the challenge: Last year, Taiwan\u2019s power sector was 83 percent dependent on fossil fuel: Coal accounted for around 42 percent of generation; natural gas 40 percent; and oil 1 percent. Nuclear supplied 6 percent, and solar, wind, hydro, and biomass together, nearly 10 percent, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, which leaves the island at the mercy both of international price fluctuations and potential blockade by China. The government has sought to shield consumers from rising global prices, but that has resulted in growing debt for the Taiwan Electric Power Company (Taipower), the national provider. In the event of a naval blockade by China, Taiwan could count on about six weeks reserves of coal but not much more than a week of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Given that LNG supplies more than a third of electricity generation, the impacts would be severe. \n",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19557263/embed",
            "The government has announced ambitious energy targets. The 2050 net-zero roadmap released by Taiwan\u2019s National Development Council in 2022 promised to shut down its nuclear sector by 2025. By the same year, the share of coal would have to come down to 30 percent, gas would have to rise to 50 percent, and renewables would have to leap to 20 percent. None of those targets is on track. ",
            "Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. \u201cThe problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don\u2019t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.\u201d Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks.",
            "According to Peter Kurz, a consultant to the technology sector and a long-term resident of Taiwan, there is one renewable resource that the nation has in abundance. \u201cThe Taiwan Strait has a huge wind resource,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the most wind power anywhere in the world available close to a population.\u201d",
            "BQGovernment critics regard the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor as needless self-harm.",
            "Offshore wind is under development, but the government is criticized for imposing burdensome requirements to use Taiwanese products and workers that the country is not well equipped to meet. They reflect the government\u2019s ambition to build a native industry at the same time as addressing its energy problem. But critics point out that Taiwan lacks the specialist industrial skills that producing turbines demands, and the requirements lead to higher costs and delays.",
            "Despite the attraction of Taiwan\u2019s west coast with its relatively shallow waters, there are other constraints, such as limited harbor space. There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan\u2019s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters from China\u2019s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable.",
            "Government critics regard one current policy as needless self-harm: the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor by next year and achieve a \u201cnuclear free homeland.\u201d It is a pledge made by the current ruling party, the Democratic People\u2019s Party (DPP) and, as the deadline approaches, it is a policy increasingly being questioned. Taiwan\u2019s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978. The DPP came into existence in 1986, the year of the Chernobyl disaster, and its decision to adopt a no-nuclear policy was reinforced by the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan in 2011.",

The shuttered reactors have not yet been decommissioned, possibly because, in addition to its other difficulties, Taiwan has run out of waste storage capacity: The fuel rods remain in place because there is nowhere else to put them. As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change. Voters added to the confusion in 2021 when they opposed the completion of the two uncommissioned plants.",
            "On the 13th floor of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei, the deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s energy administration, Stephen Wu, chose his words carefully. \u201cThere is a debate going on in our parliament,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the public has demanded a reduction of nuclear power and also a reduction in carbon emissions. So there is some discussion about whether the [shuttered] nuclear plants will somehow function again when conditions are ready.\u201d",
            "BQIf Taiwan does not accelerate clean energy deployment, companies will be obliged to leave the island, an analyst warns.",
            "Wu acknowledged that Taiwan was nudging against the limits of its current supply and that new entrants to Taiwan\u2019s science and technology parks have to be carefully screened for their energy needs. But he took an optimistic view of Taiwan\u2019s capacity to sustain A.I. development. \u201cWe assess energy consumption of companies to ensure the development of these companies complies with environmental protection,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Singapore, data centers are highly efficient. We will learn from Singapore.\u201d",

Chen has an alarming message: If Taiwan does not radically accelerate its clean energy development, he warns, companies will be obliged to leave the island. They will seek zero-carbon operating environments to comply with the net-zero requirements of partners such as Amazon, Meta, and Google, and to avoid carbon-based trade barriers such as the European Union\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. ",

            "For Kurz, Taiwan\u2019s energy security dilemma requires an imaginative leap. \u201cCables [carrying offshore wind energy] are vulnerable but replaceable,\u201d he says. \u201cCentralized nuclear is vulnerable to other risks, such as earthquakes.\u201d One solution, he believes, lies in small modular nuclear reactors that could even be moored offshore and linked with undersea cables. It is a solution that he believes the Taiwan\u2019s ruling party might come around to.",
            "There is a further security question to add to Taiwan\u2019s complex challenges. The island\u2019s circumstances are unique: It is a functioning democracy, a technological powerhouse, and a de facto independent country that China regards as a breakaway province to be recovered \u2014 if necessary, by force. The fact that its technology industry is essential for global production of everything from electric vehicles to ballistic missiles has counted as a security plus for Taiwan in its increasingly tense stand-off with China. It is not in the interest of China or the United States to see semiconductor manufacturers damaged or destroyed. Such companies, in security jargon, are collectively labelled Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a shield the government is keen to maintain. That the sector depends inescapably on Taiwan\u2019s energy security renders the search for a solution all the more urgent."

And few rivers carry a headier and more sobering brew of history \u2014 tales of human woe and triumph \u2014 than the Tigris and Euphrates, the fabled waterways that pour through the heartlands of Eurasian civilization, through the Fertile Crescent, from their chilly headwaters in the mountains of Turkey through vast watersheds in Syria, Kuwait, and Iran, to finally empty into Persian Gulf at the sweltering marshland shores of Iraq.",
            "Ten years ago, I walked with Yazar along the banks of Tigris at the antique settlement of Hasankeyf in Turkey. A local shepherd named \u00c7oban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf, once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels \u2014 a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory \u2014 were soon to be erased.",

            "Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas. UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site and calls it \u201cone of the ecologically richest regions of Africa.\u201d",
            "But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

            "Many armed groups stayed on after the civil wars, setting up crude mining operations for coltan (used in cellphones and personal computers), cassiterite (tin ore), and gold. Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",
            "BQ\u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that \u201cpark guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.\u201d",
            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas. The result, he says, is \u201cthousands of hectares of deforestation,\u201d visible in satellite images.",

The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides \u201cideal hideouts\u201d for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is \u201cthe only feasible form of enforcement.\u201d",
            "But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",
            "\u201cDoes the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

The vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 490,000 school buses \u2014 which comprise the nation\u2019s largest public-transportation fleet \u2014 are powered by diesel engines. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning our kids on the way to school,\u201d said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children\u2019s lungs.",
            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",

            "fCChildren aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February.\nTom Brenner / AP Photo.",
            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19371586/embed",
            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

The destruction on Cima Dome \u2014 which is higher in elevation and cooler than the surrounding desert \u2014 came as an especially severe blow to the National Park Service and conservationists who had considered it a stronghold for the eastern Joshua tree and a key to the species\u2019 future.\n",
            "Experts were planning to make Cima Dome a refuge by clearing out invasive grasses and monitoring the woodland\u2019s health, said Andrew Kaiser, a botanist who worked at the Mojave National Preserve during the fires and now works for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, developing its Western Joshua Tree Conservation Plan. \u201cThe perimeter of the 2020 Dome fire was essentially the exact outline of the model climate refugia.

            "The western Joshua tree has been proposed for threatened status under the California Endangered Species Act and has been regulated, since 2023, by the state\u2019s Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act, which forbids cutting trees from either private or public land without authorization from the state. The federal government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, rejected federal endangered species protection for both subspecies, most recently in 2023.",
            "One reason for the lack of protection is that there is currently no shortage of Joshua trees \u2014 the threat is based on projections of future loss. The population of eastern Joshua trees is estimated to be several million, and the western population contains as many as 10 million trees. Nonetheless, Cummings argues that they are both deserving of protection because the forecasts of the future look bleak. \u201cWe know they are on an extinction trajectory, given the threat of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf climate change is frozen at current levels, we [still] lose half their range.\u201d Temperatures, of course, are not expected to remain steady.",

Ironically, one of the biggest threats to trees are large-scale solar arrays that are being built to help wean the state off fossil fuels. The 530-megawatt Aratina solar-plus-storage project, to be built on private land near Boron, California, would kill nearly 4,000 Joshua trees and reduce habitat for desert tortoises and other species.",

A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geoengineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change.",
            "Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral \u2014 eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",

They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can\u2019t wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t mitigate our way out of this,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe need other tools.\u201d\n",

Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",

            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.

The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",
            "Moore calls the bubble barrier a \u201cwild card.\u201d But, he says, \u201cit is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.\u201d Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched.",
            "BQAn Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides.",
            "There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "In an ideal world, Scambos says, \u201cwe could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.\u201d But the world isn\u2019t like that.

But \u201cnone of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.\u201d",

            "The 2.2-mile-long tunnel, completed at a cost of $615 million but not due to begin operating until early 2026, will reduce sewage and stormwater overflows into the Potomac River from 140 million gallons a year, between 2000 and 2016, to 17 million gallons a year, said Justin Carl, chief executive of AlexRenew, the city\u2019s public wastewater treatment authority. Alexandria\u2019s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four.",
            "The project includes some green infrastructure, like bioretention basins and tree wells that filter and retain stormwater runoff.

When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",

The two pilots were not seated front and center; instead, they steered the plane in a capsule attached far out on the right wing. The plane had some other unusual features. On the far-left wing, another slender capsule contained a tank of so-called cryogenic hydrogen, cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius, or minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. A fuel cell inside the plane caused the liquid hydrogen to react with oxygen, producing water and enough electricity to power an electric motor with the propeller attached. The plane flew not with fossil fuel, but with hydrogen.",
            "The \u201cHY4,\u201d as the aircraft is called, circled the southeastern foothills of the Alps for a total of more than three hours that day \u2014 a major success, according to Josef Kallo, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Ulm in Germany and CEO of H2Fly, a startup based in Stuttgart. \u201cWe have flown with hydrogen many times before, but now we were able to demonstrate all the processes required for a flight of more than 1,000 kilometers,\u201d Kallo says. His goal is to make so-called \u201cgreen hydrogen,\u201d produced by wind and solar farms, the new standard fuel in aviation. \u201cHydrogen is the most efficient fuel that can be made using renewable energies,\u201d he says.",

At least two other startup companies, U.S.-based Universal Hydrogen and U.K.-based ZeroAvia, are pursuing this goal, too.

The U.S.-based company is the archrival of the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of airliners, Europe-based Airbus. Raymond argues that, in a best-case scenario, \u201chydrogen-powered aircraft may make a small contribution to moderating emissions in 2050.\u201d For now, the aviation industry finds itself in the midst of a struggle over how to clear its reputation as a leading climate polluter.",
            "Globally, aviation contributes about 2.5 percent to energy-related CO2 emissions, a sizeable share. Contrails and nitrous oxides, byproducts of burning fossil fuels at high altitudes, also contribute to heating Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans, and they could even triple aviation\u2019s climate impact, according to a widely cited 2021 study by Manchester Metropolitan University in the U.K.",

Boeing claims that SAF \u201clowers carbon emissions over the fuel\u2019s life cycle by up to 80 percent, depending on the feedstock.\u201d Another advantage of SAFs is that they are \u201cdrop in\u201d fuels, meaning they can be easily incorporated into existing airport fueling systems.

That\u2019s twice as much as in 2022, but still only a miniscule 0.2 percent of the 286 million tons of fossil fuel combusted in planes that year.",
            "Regulators currently allow planes to burn fuel mixtures that contain a maximum of 50 percent SAF, though engineers are retrofitting engines to burn a larger share. Boeing has said that all its new planes will be able to fly with pure SAF by 2030.

            "Two problems cast a big shadow: SAF\u2019s availability and its carbon footprint. While most SAFs are currently derived mainly from animal and industrial waste, IATA has called for algae, waste biomass from forestry, agriculture, and municipal waste to be added to the feedstock of refineries as fast as possible. With such a diverse feedstock, however, achieving and proving carbon-neutrality will be difficult. Any kind of biomass feedstock will generate CO2 emissions, for example when energy-intensive fertilizer or diesel tractors and trucks are used in industrial agriculture.",

Regularly, huge cargo planes appear on the horizon and descend toward a nearby airport, carrying fuselages, wings, and other large plane parts built elsewhere across Europe for his next-door neighbor, Airbus. About half of all the company\u2019s new A320 jets are assembled here.",
            "This proximity increases Nagel\u2019s sense of urgency. \u201cBy 2028,\u201d he says, \u201cthe global aircraft industry must have made its most important decisions on how to become climate neutral.\u201d It takes about seven years to develop a new type of plane, and after becoming operational, these planes will remain in service for 30 to 40 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a race with time,\u201d he says.",
            "Nagel led one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive studies of aviation\u2019s climate strategies, a project called \u201cEXACT,\u201d in which 165 scientists from 20 institutes compared, among other things, how airports around the world \u2014 Tokyo, Dubai, and Frankfurt among them \u2014 could be supplied with either SAF or hydrogen and how their environmental impacts would differ. They examined how to reduce contrails and nitrous oxide emissions most efficiently, and they came up with futuristic new plane designs, including one with a staggering 10 electric engines and propellers.",
            "BQSustainable fuel might not be available in large enough quantities, and harvesting it could harm vulnerable ecosystems.",
            "The studies underscored the challenges of using hydrogen as aviation fuel. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you can\u2019t just put a hydrogen tank in an airplane and fly off,\u201d Nagel says. New materials are needed to build the planes because tiny hydrogen atoms easily leak and tend to make anything they touch brittle. Nagel acknowledges that deep changes to aircraft architecture are necessary. Computer-simulated hydrogen planes developed in the EXACT study don\u2019t have their fuel tanks spread out in the wings, as current planes do. Instead, they are designed to be nearly spherical, to reduce their surface area and the weight of the insulation needed to keep hydrogen fuel in its cryogenic state. One option under consideration is to place them in the plane\u2019s tail, which would affect the plane\u2019s overall weight balance. ",
            "Fuel cells must also become much lighter and more efficient than they are today. In terms of climate impact, the most important open question is to what extent hydrogen \u2014 which only produces water vapor as an exhaust \u2014 causes contrails. A project is under way in cooperation with Airbus, in which research planes fly behind passenger jets to determine the effects. For SAF, a considerable reduction could be shown compared to fossil jet fuel, since due to their higher chemical purity, SAFs emit much less of the soot that causes contrails.\n",
            "But SAF still has strong downsides. \u201cUsing hydrogen to first synthesize kerosene\u201d \u2014 as in the Power to Liquid process, says Nagel \u2014 \u201cconsumes up to 45 percent more primary energy than using hydrogen directly as a fuel, a huge number.\u201d",

            "Also, the biomass needed for SAF might simply not be available in large enough quantities in the future, and harvesting and collecting it could harm vulnerable ecosystems. In terms of cost, liquid hydrogen fuel will require higher initial investments, Nagel says, but it should come out on par or cheaper than SAFs when their biomass demand, and the high cost of direct air capture of carbon, are figured in. When critics point out that hydrogen requires four times the volume per unit of energy as kerosene, Nagel answers that it weighs three times less. \u201cAccording to our calculations, this largely cancels each other out,\u201d he says.\n",
            "Nagel admits that many challenges remain. \u201cThe devil is in the details\u201d is a phrase he often uses. Overall, he has concluded that hydrogen, if made with electricity from renewable sources, has enough advantages to become the fuel of the future, with SAF and \u201celectro-SAF\u201d filling in for some time to come and for certain demands.",
            "BQAirbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen-powered plane fit to transport passengers to the market by 2035. ",
            "Nagel is convinced that hydrogen\u2019s technological challenges can be resolved. With that goal, his institute is turning a ground-based A320 jet into a \u201cHydrogen Aviation Lab\u201d at Hamburg airport to test components and create a filling station for hydrogen fuel made by the region\u2019s wind farms, in a project run by Lufthansa Technik. The German Aerospace Center is also involved in turning a Dornier 328 into a flying test bed for hydrogen-electric propulsion, and it is testing direct hydrogen combustion engines in Cologne.",
            "But like all big players, the research agency is hedging its bets on aviation\u2019s future. It is also researching Power to Liquid technologies, for which a pilot plant will be built in Eastern Germany. And in the U.S., Boeing is pursuing research on hydrogen propulsion. \u201cWe know it will take an \u2018SAF and\u2019 approach and not an \u2018SAF or\u2019 approach to achieving net-zero by 2050,\u201d Boeing\u2019s Raymond concedes.",
            "Given Boeing\u2019s current massive quality problems with its existing fleet, it is safe to say that hydrogen propulsion will either be developed in Europe, or nowhere. \u201cWe\u2019d like to work with all aircraft manufacturers on hydrogen but it is clear that Boeing has a different focus right now,\u201d Nagel says. In contrast, Airbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen plane fit to transport passengers to the market by 2035. At the Dubai air show last December, Airbus\u2019 chief sustainability officer, Julie Kitcher, radiated optimism when she said that hydrogen propulsion is moving towards \u201ctechnological readiness.\u201d In January, the company opened a brand-new R&D center for hydrogen technologies in Stade, some 40 kilometers north of Hamburg down the Elbe River."

Many reserves will be too deep or remote to tap easily \u2014 around hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean, for instance. But if Ellis is right, then just a small fraction could meet the world\u2019s needs for centuries. And it could in places be tapped for less than $1,000 per ton, says Emily Yedinak of the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy making it substantially cheaper than manufactured hydrogen.",

            "Texas is by far the top emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States: The oil-rich state releases twice as much carbon dioxide as the runner-up state, California, and as much as the entire country of Germany.",
            "But the air in Texas may soon get a slight reprieve. Last April, the Texas-based company 1PointFive broke ground on a direct air capture facility called Stratos that, by 2025, aims to absorb 500,000 metric tons of atmospheric CO2 each year. That\u2019s 125 times more CO2 than the next-largest direct air capture plant.\n",
            "The concept of direct air capture has been around for decades. In the face of skyrocketing global temperatures and CO2 levels, the idea is simple: remove some of that CO2 from the air and either bury it underground or turn it into a saleable product. After years of lab tests and experiments, these efforts  started to gain commercial traction a few years ago. Now, direct air capture is seriously ramping up, with about 20 plants in operation across Europe, Canada, and the U.S., where the Department of Energy is funding four regional direct air capture hubs. Globally, more than 100 plants are at some stage of development.\n",
            "Though the concept is simple, there are still plenty of hurdles. Building and operating an air capture plant is about 50 times more expensive than planting trees per ton of CO2 taken up. Researchers are working hard to come up with new materials and systems to lower that price tag, encouraged by government prize money and rising tax breaks and carbon credits.",
            "BQPulling CO2 straight from the air is expensive, but it can be done nearly anywhere, with easily quantifiable results.",
            "Those incentives are important given the second major issue: scale. The plants in operation today together capture just 10,000 metric tons of CO2 a year. The largest of these \u2014 a project called Orca, run in Iceland by Climeworks \u2014 soaks up 4,000 metric tons per year. But the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) pathway to net zero by 2050 calls for pulling 80 million metric tons of CO2 from the air annually by 2030, and more than a billion metric tons by 2050. That will involve a herculean effort, requiring tens of megaton-scale plants to be built per year. Stratos would be just the first.",

While the world ramps up installations of wind and solar to replace the burning of fossil fuels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that carbon dioxide removal, while not a substitute for deep emissions reductions, \u201cis part of all modelled scenarios that limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or lower by 2100.\u201d",

Planting and protecting forests and other ecosystems \u2014 called nature-based solutions \u2014 is relatively cheap, can be done at large scale, and has a heap of side benefits, including the provision of habitat for endangered species, flood protection, or increased food supplies for humans. The IPCC\u2019s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C calculated that up to 11 billion metric tons of CO2 could be drawn down in this manner per year by 2050, a huge chunk of today\u2019s roughly 35 billion metric tons in emissions. But the amount of carbon stored by nature can be hard to estimate and uncertain: A wildfire can wipe out a forest, for example.\n",
            "According to the IEA, capturing CO2 directly from the flue stacks of power plants and other industrial operations, like concrete plants, which are hard-to-mitigate sectors, should be used to soak up nearly 4 billion metric tons of CO2 a year by 2050. But these methods don\u2019t touch legacy CO2, which is more dilute in the atmosphere. Pulling CO2 straight from the air is expensive, but it can be done nearly anywhere, with easily quantifiable results. The IEA target of roughly 1 billion metric tons by 2050 is a smaller but still substantial slice of the pie.",
            "BQOnce CO2 is captured, companies need to decide what to do with it: bury it or use it to make a product.",
            "Today, there are two main strategies for air capture, each of which involves large fans that pull air into a processing area. The first strategy absorbs CO2 onto a solid filter; then a combination of low pressure and moderate temperatures (around 90 degrees C) pulls the concentrated CO2 back out. This process has a relatively high energy requirement, but the biggest plant currently using it \u2014 Climework\u2019s Orca \u2014 makes use of geothermal energy. The capture units \u2014 Orca\u2019s resemble industrial air conditioners the size of a shipping container \u2014 are typically modular, so a capture facility can host just a handful of these units, or many, and be placed basically anywhere there\u2019s ready access to renewable energy.",
            "The second strategy absorbs CO2 into a liquid, transfers the CO2 to limestone pellets, and uses very high temperatures (about 600 degrees C) \u2014 typically supplied by a fossil-fuel-powered furnace \u2014 to remove the CO2 and recover the reagents. The CO2 released from the furnace can be captured too. This system requires a lot of water. But the chemical process is well suited to very large operations. This technique, as developed by the British Columbia-based company Carbon Engineering, is powering Stratos.",
            "Other options are available. The California-based company Heirloom, which opened the first commercial air capture plant in the U.S. last November, with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons a year, uses a variant on the limestone technology. The company simply exposes trays of powdered calcium oxide to air to soak up CO2 and turn it into limestone. Like the other limestone technique, the Heirloom process also releases CO2 from the limestone using high temperatures, but this facility uses renewable energy to do so.",

            "All of this is costly. Businesses can currently buy carbon credits online from Climeworks at the startling price of $1,500 per metric ton. That\u2019s extremely expensive; other voluntary carbon credits \u2014 from schemes that plant trees or make industry more efficient and less polluting, for example \u2014 can be purchased for tens of dollars per metric ton. But these credits are still attractive because they are easily quantifiable, verifiable, and durable over long time periods. Microsoft announced in 2022 that it bought 10,000 metric tons of credits from Climeworks in a 10-year deal, though it did not disclose the price. 1PointFive has deals in place to sell credits to Amazon, Airbus, and other companies once it\u2019s up and running.",
            "Of course, the commercial selling price of carbon credits isn\u2019t the same as the company\u2019s cost of capture. That is surely lower, but numbers are hard to pin down; Climeworks won\u2019t disclose specifics but says $1,000 per metric ton is in the ballpark. The IEA estimates that the operational costs of direct air capture should get to between $230 and $630 per metric ton of CO2 once scaled up, depending in large part on energy costs, says Mathilde Fajardy, an IEA analyst. Others are less optimistic. According to Howard Herzog, of MIT\u2019s Energy Initiative, a reasonable estimate for the cost of direct air capture by 2030 is between $600 and $1,000 per metric ton of CO2. \u201cMost estimates out there are unrealistic,\u201d he says.",
            "BQAbout three-quarters of globally captured C02 is currently being used for enhanced oil recovery, which is controversial. ",
            "To tackle both cost and energy use, the DOE\u2019s Carbon Negative Shot program, launched in 2021, ambitiously aims to get the cost of direct air capture below $100 per metric ton by sponsoring technology innovation. That price would make air capture profitable against, for example, a U.S. tax credit that, as of 2022, offers $180 per metric ton for large-scale stored CO2.",
            "Last December, the DOE put up more than $1 million in prize money for promising direct air capture technologies. There are seven semi-finalists. Elysia Labs, in Phoenix, for example, is developing a nanofiber-based sorbent that needs less of a pressure drop and thus requires less energy to pull CO2 from the air. And N\u016bxsen, in New York City, is developing an electrochemical cell that it says can capture and release CO2 without energy-intensive heat or pressure changes; the company plans to use small modular nuclear reactors to power its system.",
            "Meanwhile, some researchers are using artificial intelligence to accelerate innovation. Meta \u2014 the company behind Facebook and Instagram \u2014 is working with Georgia Tech on the OpenDAC project to help find better porous polymers to efficiently soak up and release CO2.

            "Yet once CO2 is captured, companies need to decide what to do with it. The most carbon-negative option is to bury it deep underground. This is what Climeworks does in Iceland, for example, and plans to do with its upgraded facility, called Mammoth, due to launch this year. There are plenty of suitable geological repositories for buried CO2. But for now, this strategy is in the minority: the IEA reports that as of 2022, out of 18 plants operating globally, only two \u2014 both run by Climeworks in Iceland \u2014 bury their CO2.",
            "The other option is to use captured CO2 to make a product \u2014 like fertilizer, for example \u2014 or use it to carbonize beverages or as an ingredient in other industrial chemicals. This is what the majority of direct air capture plants do today. Heirloom, for example, works with a partner company to use its captured CO2 in making concrete. The biggest potential future market could be synthetic fuels for airplanes, wherein captured CO2 is combined with green hydrogen (made by splitting water with renewable electricity) to make synthetic hydrocarbons. The Norsk e-fuel project in Norway, the Haru Oni efuels plant in Chile, the AtmosFUEL project in the U.K., and Carbon Engineering, in Canada, are among companies pursuing this end use. In the IEA\u2019s pathway to net zero, about 35 percent of air-captured CO2 gets used for synthetic fuels by 2050, while the rest is buried.",
            "BQThe energy it takes to power capture, says one critic, would be better spent replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity.",
            "For now, though, about three-quarters of all globally captured CO2 (which comes mainly from industrial flue stacks) is currently being used for enhanced oil recovery, says Fajardy. The CO2 gets injected into oil wells to both bury it and to help push out more oil. This is controversial, as many note that it doesn\u2019t disincentivize fossil fuels. \u201cEnhanced oil recovery has been a stepping stone for early carbon capture and storage projects to help with the economics,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cIf your primary goal is negative emissions, it is not a good fit.\u201d But supporters point out that it\u2019s still burying CO2: If done carefully, they claim, then even after burning the recovered oil the process can come out as a net zero or even a net negative equation for carbon, though that\u2019s hard to quantify.",
            "What will happen to Stratos\u2019 CO2 hasn\u2019t yet been decided. The plant\u2019s location in Texas, and the fact that the companies building it, 1PointFive and Carbon Engineering, are both owned by Occidental Petroleum, has led some to speculate that this project will be used for enhanced oil recovery. Kel Coulson, Carbon Engineering\u2019s director of policy, says Stratos has several options for its CO2, including burying it in saline reservoirs or producing low-carbon products, which they call \u201cnet-zero oil.\u201d \u201cThe ultimate use of captured CO2 from Stratos will be driven by customer preference,\u201d Coulson says.",

            "The economic and environmental hurdles leave some concluding that air capture is not a good idea at all. Mark Jacobson, director of the Atmosphere/Energy program at Stanford University, has long been a detractor: The energy it takes to power capture, he says, would be far better spent replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity for decades to come. \u201cThere is never a case where direct air capture or carbon capture is useful,\u201d Jacobson says.",
            "Despite such criticism, the industry is moving forward. Last August, the DOE selected two megaton-scale projects for funding: another 1PointFive venture in Kleberg County, Texas, and an effort in Louisiana called Project Cypress, which has announced it will not participate in enhanced oil recovery. Two more hubs will follow from the DOE. And a handful of other megaton-scale efforts are planned elsewhere, including a Carbon Engineering effort in the United Arab Emirates and Project Bison in Wyoming, which is aiming to capture an ambitious 5 megatons a year by 2030.",
            "If all 100-plus projects on the drawing board go ahead as planned, they\u2019ll capture around 70 metric megatons of CO2 by 2030, says the IEA. That\u2019s very close to their 80 metric megaton target. But it\u2019s also a very big if."

            "Marine carbon dioxide removal is a form of geoengineering, perhaps the most polarizing word in climate science today. Although scientists and governments seem more alarmed by atmospheric geoengineering efforts, like altering the reflective capacity of the sky with injections of sulfur dioxide, they have also expressed concerns about mCDR, if only because it is so little understood. Iceland\u2019s small size, and its acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis, have made it an ideal incubator for mCDR science. But the IPCC\u2019s and other groups\u2019 increasingly dire warnings about the need to act now, and to act in a multitude of ways that include mCDR, has been loud enough to get the attention of much larger governments, including the Biden administration.",

In October, the program \u2014 called Sensing Exports of Anthropogenic Carbon Through Ocean Observation (SEA-CO2) \u2014 announced its first tranche of funding: $36 million to be distributed among 11 labs, academic institutions, and private companies in nine states.",
            "Ward and his colleagues at PNNL\u2019s Sequim, Washington, campus have been awarded just over $2 million to develop models and lab experiments to better understand the effectiveness and impact of one of the better-understood mCDR techniques \u2014 ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE). Reducing the acidity of seawater increases its alkalinity; the higher its alkalinity, the more atmospheric CO2 it can absorb and transform into stabler, inorganic carbon, which is less likely to seep back into the air. Since last year, the company Ebb Carbon has been operating its OAE system at the Sequin campus, filtering seawater through a series of membranes that, when pulsed with electricity, extract its acid. With its federal grant, Ward says, the lab will be testing OAE methods from a handful of other companies.\n",

Such facilities, according to Eisaman, yield around 40 billion gallons of brine a day, globally, most of which is discharged into the sea. \u201cIf you convert all that salt to alkalinity with the process we\u2019re pursuing,\u201d he says, more than 1 billion tons of CO2 are pulled from the air and stored in the ocean per year. To reduce acidification at oceanic scales would be impossible, but Eisaman says that isn\u2019t Ebb Carbon\u2019s goal. He pointed to the oyster farms in the bays and estuaries around Sequin that have been suffering from acidification, which thins the shells of bivalves. \u201cYou could use this to kind of keep that relatively small local body of water similar to a preindustrial equilibrium that is ideal for shellfish.\u201d ",
            "Instead of using electricity to shock the acid from seawater, other companies are experimenting with alkaline rocks, like basalt or olivine, which over thousands of years break down and make their way into the oceans. To speed up that natural process, often called \u201cenhanced rock weathering,\u201d the material can be mined, pulverized, and mixed into the ocean. Eisaman argues that \u201copen systems\u201d like this, which use the Earth\u2019s own carbon cycle instead of \u201cclosed systems\u201d like direct air capture, are \u201capproaches that will have the potential to scale gigatons and at low cost.\u201d (Running Tide also coats its wood chips with an alkaline material, with the goal of simultaneously transferring CO2 to the ocean and combating acidification.)",

            "At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, scientists will be using their portion of the SEA-CO2 funding to develop sensors that can be attached to scientific moorings and autonomous underwater vehicles to continuously measure carbon concentrations in seawater. Such sensors would benefit companies that aim to grow macroalgae \u2014 seaweed and kelp \u2014 that draw large amounts of CO2 from the air, then sink them into the deep ocean. But some scientists say such efforts are risky. As it breaks down in the water column, this biomass produces organic carbon that \u201ccan be eaten by bacteria, which causes all sorts of transformations in the environment,\u201d says Ward. \u201cFor example, on the seafloor, you have organic carbon that can transform into different greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide and methane, depending on the conditions. If we\u2019re not monitoring for production of these other greenhouse gases, we can\u2019t tell you exactly how much carbon was truly sequestered.\u201d \n",
            "Running Tide, in fact, offers a cautionary tale about sinking macroalgae. In 2021, the company filed a patent for a floating apparatus seeded with kelp and \u201cenhanced with a nutrient payload\u201d of iron oxide to spur the growth of phytoplankton blooms, which can consume large amounts of atmospheric CO2. The plan raised enough concerns about unintended consequences that some of the company\u2019s scientists reportedly quit. In a 2022 article published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the University of Tasmania marine biochemist Phillip Boyd and coauthors modeled the potential impacts of apparatuses like that proposed by Running Tide, concluding that they would likely present a \u201crange of biological threats\u201d for offshore ecosystems, from altered water chemistry to the introduction of invasive microorganisms. Asked to respond to that criticism, Running Tide\u2019s Hr\u00f3bjartsson said in an email, \u201cWe would never, and never have, deployed anything into the ocean that isn\u2019t deemed at most a minor or transitory impact on the ocean environment by best available science.\u201d",

            "Ultimately, Boyd and his coauthors concluded that there was a great need for just the kind of research that the SEA-CO2 program will produce. \u201cMarine carbon removal is a very challenging field, because it\u2019s not just about the science,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cThere\u2019s the technology aspect, the economics, the communicating to the public, the regulatory frameworks, and then there\u2019s the markets. And, as far as I can see, none of those are really fit for purpose at the moment.\u201d",
            "BQSome scientists say CO2 removal is simply a distraction from the urgency of the climate crisis and an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels.",
            "Despite the fact that scientists are only just beginning to look into the effectiveness of mCDR, private carbon markets are flourishing, and private investors have been betting big on its success. Some of the largest names in tech have already pumped tens of millions of dollars into Ebb Carbon, Running Tide, and others.\n",
            "Of course, recent years have shown the grave danger of Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite mantra, \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d When it comes to the environment, moving fast may be critical, but breaking things can be catastrophic. Some scientists have made the point that carbon dioxide removal \u2014 and the sale of those carbon credits \u2014 is simply a distraction from the urgency of the climate crisis and an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels. Friederike Otto, a lead author of the latest IPCC report, recently told The Guardian that the tools to keep warming to 1.5 degrees are already available and completely understood: stop extracting fossil fuels, scale back industrial farming and deforestation, the list goes on. \u201cWe should act as if CDR will never be achievable,\u201d Otto said. \u201cWe do not have a technology at the moment that works at scale\u2026 so we should make our policies as if CDR is not an option.\u201d",
            "Boyd agrees that a CDR technology that is safe, effective at storing carbon for long durations, verifiable, and scalable does not yet exist. But we need the acceleration that private business and carbon markets can bring, he says. \u201cIf we are going to build this partnership with businesses, [which] have the tools and the wherewithal and the infrastructure to really drive this, then there has to be a more substantive conversation around what the speed bumps are,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we want to hold [companies] back, but at the same time, the ocean is a complex place.\u201d",
            "Correction, April 23, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly quoted Running Tide\u2019s Kristinn Hr\u00f3bjartsson as saying the company has no plans to sink macroalgae into the ocean. The company is currently studying the impact of sinking macroalgae."

I saw few signs of human life on the wild Nahanni and the muddy Liard. But once I got to the Mackenzie, which is part of the second longest river system on the continent, I had to make way for tugboats pulling giant barges filled with gas, heating fuel, dry food, and other supplies destined for roadless Indigenous communities downstream of the village of Wrigley, where the Mackenzie Highway, which begins in Alberta, ends. More than once on a cold misty night, I was awoken in my tent by the deafening blast of a tug\u2019s horn.",
            "Nowadays, those horn blasts are far less frequent because the Mackenzie River, which flows northwest to the Arctic Ocean and is part of the second longest river system on the continent, is at times not deep enough to float those barges. In fact, the government-owned company that operates the tugs stopped service altogether this year when it became clear the river would not contain sufficient water \u2014 even in late spring, after river ice melted. In June, the Canadian Coast Guard announced its services, including the provision of on-the-water responses and maintenance of aids to navigation, were \u201cimpacted\u201d for almost a thousand miles of river.\n",
            "With fresh and dried food, essential building supplies, and fuel now being flown in by plane, and prices skyrocketing, residents in the five communities in the Sahtu region are ramping up their demand for the Canadian government to build a $1 billion (Canadian) road and bridge \u2014 known as the Mackenzie Valley Highway project \u2014 that will serve as a lifeline and connect them with other communities and services in the south. Many are currently rationing fuel and bringing in food from the south while vacationing or undergoing medical exams and treatment.\n",

The road was estimated to cost at least $700 million, and in 2018 the government allocated approximately $70 million to study its feasibility. But last February, Canada\u2019s Environment Minister announced the government would no longer invest in major, new road construction.

A separate 200-mile route to the more remote inland community of Baker Lake is also under consideration. Neither of these roads, nor the Mackenzie Valley Highway, could be built without significant federal funding.",

But few tourists undertake the long, punishing drive, and the oil and gas companies pulled out of the region before the road was even completed. Today, Tuktoyaktuk is slowly sliding into the sea due to rising sea levels, powerful storms surges, and rapidly thawing permafrost.",

In the United States, heat waves are now considered the deadliest weather-related natural disaster. But because heat deaths may present as heart attacks, kidney failure, or other diseases, experts agree that heat-related deaths are grossly undercounted.\n",
            "Earlier this year, the Federation of American Scientists called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to upgrade and expand its health-tracking systems to more accurately reflect the true toll of heat waves on human health, to develop guidelines for states reporting on heat-related deaths, and to integrate environmental conditions with electronic health records.\n",
            "Knowing how many people a year die due to heat would not only raise public awareness of the issue and help save lives, says Kristie Ebi, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who has been studying the impact of climate change on human health for more than 30 years, it will also ensure that investments in heat resilience reflect the magnitude of the problem.\n",

But that\u2019s just a tiny fraction of the total number of people who die during and immediately after a heat wave. Excess death analyses after a heat wave indicate about 50 percent of all deaths are from cardiovascular causes.",

But there\u2019s also people who die from kidney causes, from respiratory causes, from a range of other issues, and parsing out how heat contributed to those illnesses is challenging at the individual level.

The goals of understanding the numbers of deaths from heat include raising awareness and ensuring that the level of investment reflects the magnitude of the problem.\n",

            "Down on the south end of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, oil rigs have plumbed the earth like flocks of blackened drinking birds for more than a century. Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "fCParabolic mirrors at a solar thermal plant in Kramer Junction, California. \nWarren Gretz / NREL",
            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

            "Researchers at NREL had been thinking about something like GeoTES for years, but they needed funding and land to make it a reality, which led them to partner with a Kern County-based energy investment firm, Premier Resource Management, in Bakersfield. In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea. By early this year, when California officially announced a ban on new permits for hydraulic fracking, they were fully focused on a way to give the old wells new life \u2014 as a battery, of sorts.\n",
            "BQTo survive a downturn in oil and gas, Kern County aims to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub.",
            "In its heyday in the mid-1980s, Kern County produced 256 million barrels of oil a year, and it remains the seventh-largest oil producing county in the U.S. Despite the industry\u2019s harm \u2014 more people per capita die from chronic lower respiratory disease here than anywhere else in California \u2014 drilling still pumps $13 billion a year into the local economy. Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

            "The geothermal industry would appear to offer a relatively seamless shift for many oilfield workers. Often, contractors can simply apply their skills to hot water instead of oil. As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",
            "Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology for the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council, a global nonprofit that works to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage, cautions that 10-hour energy-storage solutions will help us get through the swing from night to day, but that we produce and consume renewable energy on a scale that spans seasons.\n",
            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",
            "BQThe world will need up to 100,000 tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean doubling mining.",
            "Another driver of the search for new sources of uranium, which is essential to nuclear reactors, is geopolitics. The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts. But based on the industry\u2019s track record of polluting air, water, and soil with both radioactivity and heavy metals, and its obfuscation of mining\u2019s environmental threats, many observers \u2014 especially Indigenous people, who have borne the brunt of past uranium mining and who still suffer health problems linked with unremediated mining sites \u2014 remain skeptical.\n",
            "Exploration continues nonetheless. \u201cEveryone is convinced there is going to be a much larger demand for uranium going forward,\u201d said Matthew L.

            "If small modular reactors \u2014 units that can produce up to 300 megawatts of energy \u2014 prove efficient and economical, Wald says, they could be mass produced quickly and further increase the demand for uranium. There are plans for several small modular reactors, which have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, currently underway in the U.S. and Canada. \n",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world will need up to 100,000 metric tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean nearly doubling mining from current levels. And so companies around the globe are both looking for new deposits and reopening old mines. In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",

            "Greenland, meanwhile, is going against this trend. Concerned with the possible health impacts of mining, the Indigenous Inuit government in 2021 banned prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of uranium. And in 2023 it denied a permit for an Australian company to mine a massive deposit of rare earth metals called Kvanefjeld because bringing them to the surface would also convey uranium, with which it is commingled. ",
            "What will this new era of uranium mining mean for the environment? Historically, the industry has polluted groundwater, surface water, and soil around the world with radioactive waste and dust, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage. In some places, damage has been remediated by industry and government. But in many cases, due to cost or the difficulty of remediation, the pollution still contaminates the environment.",

That\u2019s because most new mines now use in-situ leaching, in which ore is left in the ground and miners recover the earth\u2019s minerals by dissolving them with hydrogen peroxide or an acid or alkaline leach.

The Obama administration proposed tighter standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by in-situ uranium mining, with a focus on groundwater protection and restoration, but the Trump administration rolled those regulations back. According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this. It sounds straightforward, and it is.\u201d ",
            "Those most skeptical of the new era of uranium mining are people who live near old mining sites across the American West, where the scramble to find uranium to build the first atomic bombs during the Cold War left open pits and radioactive waste piles and dust scattered across the landscape. A disproportionate number of these sites are on or near Indigenous land.\n",

The company pumped this excess water into an open-air holding pond. But the pond wasn\u2019t big enough, so the company used water cannons to spray the overflow, which was tainted with arsenic and uranium at levels well above federal standards, into the sky to enhance the evaporation rate.\n",

            "Back in 2001, sitting on a porch one evening in Panama, the German ornithologist had the germ of an idea for an \u201cinternet of animals,\u201d a global system of sensor-wearing wildlife that would reveal the planet\u2019s elusive, nonhuman worlds. He figured he could get it up and running by 2005. Nearly 20 years later, Wikelski may have finally succeeded \u2014 after surmounting roadblocks that range from bureaucratic mishaps to technical glitches to a geopolitical crisis. His space-based system, known as ICARUS (International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space), is now scheduled to launch, in its latest, satellite-based incarnation, on a private rocket sometime in 2025.\n",
            "The underlying idea of the internet of animals is to tune into the planet\u2019s hidden phenomena \u2014 the flight paths followed by sharp-shinned hawks, the precise fates befalling Arctic terns that die young, the exact landscape requirements of critically endangered saiga antelope \u2014 by attaching tiny, solar-powered tracking devices, some weighing less than a paperclip, to all kinds of organisms and even some inanimate objects (glaciers, ocean plastic debris). The inexpensive, globe-spanning system of animal tagging is meant to help scientists understand the precise drivers of global change, and much more, by tracking thousands of tagged animals from space and tying their experiences to the broader impacts facing whole populations or even species.",
            "BQBeginning sometime next year, the ICARUS project plans to launch receivers on five low-cost miniature satellites.",
            "Wikelski, the director of the Department of Migration at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, in Germany, said the prospect of having that data, and of \u201cmaking people aware of the incredible beauty and richness of what\u2019s happening out there,\u201d has made the effort worthwhile, even urgent. It\u2019s also true, as he wrote in his recent book The Internet of Animals: Discovering the Collective Intelligence of Life on Earth, that he \u201chad no clue how many pitfalls there would be\u2026 how many times when we desperately wanted to give up, because the whole process had become so exquisitely frustrating that we just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d",
            "In 2018, after years of working with designers, engineers, and government officials from multiple countries and continents, Wikelski\u2019s team saw its ICARUS receiver launch aboard a Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station, where Russian cosmonauts attached it to their side of the orbiting lab. \u201cWe danced, cried, and hugged one another,\u201d Wikelski wrote of the launch. \u201cAll the stress of nearly 20 years fell away.\u201d",
            "The internet of animals went live in March 2020, but before the year was out, mechanical issues on the Russian ISS module took the system down. Nearly a year passed before it was up and running again. By the spring of 2021, the system was finally humming along, receiving data from roughly 3,500 tagged animals around the world. But then, in the winter of 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, and the West cut ties with Russia. ICARUS\u2019s transmission of data abruptly halted.\n",

            "After the ISS failure, Wikelski\u2019s team set out to redesign the system to use satellite-based receivers, which had always been its long-term aim. In 2022, plans seemed almost set for an ICARUS receiver to orbit on the next GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite, a joint venture between NASA and the German space agency, scheduled to launch in 2028. But last-minute political haggling siphoned more than a third of the project\u2019s German funding, leaving no money to include ICARUS. \u201cWe were totally devastated,\u201d Wikelski recalled. He gave his project three months to find a solution or finally give up. \u201cThat\u2019s when we scaled down and said, we need a CubeSat.\u201d",
            "And so beginning sometime next year, the project plans to launch ICARUS receivers on five relatively low-cost CubeSats \u2014 miniature satellites roughly the size of a Rubik\u2019s cube and weighing only a couple of pounds \u2014 using private launch companies. Funded by the Max Planck Society, the system will cost roughly $1.57 million to launch and have annual operating expenses of around $160,000.\n",
            "\u201cThe geopolitical aspect of this is pretty huge,\u201d said Michael Wunder, a quantitative ecologist at the University of Colorado Denver who used the ISS tags to study the migration patterns of mountain plovers before the war in Ukraine cut off the research. Instead of involving government space agencies, the project\u2019s new iteration keeps the scientists in control.\n",

The team is currently upgrading 4,000 older tags to work with the new system. The tags provide hourly accounts of the animal\u2019s energy expenditure; measure environmental factors like air pressure, altitude, temperature, and humidity; and even use AI to help interpret the animal\u2019s behavior.",

What were the environmental conditions when the animal was at this place at this time?\u201d\n",

Native to the plains of the north-central United Staes, the species has declined by 80 percent in the past six decades. But the birds are hard to study because of their habitat and behavior. \u201cThey\u2019re singing and vociferous but not in your face,\u201d Wunder said, and in breeding season they like their space, living in densities of only about three birds per square kilometer. The plovers often occupy private ranchlands, which makes them hard to find without trespassing. And they breed in late March and April, while bird surveys, timed to count migratory songbirds, happen in May.\n",

            "Wunder has long sought to understand whether mountain plovers follow distinct, structured migration patterns or whether birds from different areas mix together in winter flocks. He also wants to learn what drives the birds to migrate. \u201cAre they moving away from something or toward something else?\u201d he asks. He also hopes to determine exactly where the birds are running into trouble.",
            "Before the ISS receiver went dark in 2022, the ICARUS tags revealed that the plovers didn\u2019t follow fixed migration routes and that birds from around the country were mingling in the winter. When several transmitting birds died, Wunder was able to dispatch researchers to their locations and discover the cause of death \u2014 predation. The birds started returning to Colorado in February, and Wunder was eager to see which ones would come back \u2014 but then the war in Ukraine began. \u201cWe were cut off, there was no more information,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Ellen Aikens, a biologist at the University of Wyoming who did her postdoctoral research on animal migration at the Max Planck Institute, believes that ICARUS could serve as a \u201cdemocratizing force\u201d in ecology and biology. It\u2019s a way to level the playing field, she says, so that \u201cfolks that have a smaller budget or are working on species that are a bit more obscure and there\u2019s not as much funding behind can start to get the same kind of information, baseline info, about where those [animals] are going.\u201d\n",

            "In her lab, Aikens is studying golden eagles using a tag made by the German company e-obs. \u201cIt\u2019s the gold standard of biologging in bird research, if you can afford it and your bird is big enough to carry the transformer\u201d \u2014 like geese, storks, and eagles. A single e-obs tag costs more than $1,500 and works over a cellular network, meaning researchers must also pay the cost of data transmission for as long as the animal lives. \u201cIf you want to get a good sample size that will allow you to publish your research, that adds up really quickly,\u201d Aikens said. \u201cICARUS tags are cheaper by an order of magnitude.\u201d",
            "Aikens believes that ICARUS will help transform the way scientists study animals. Our nonhuman neighbors \u201ccan take a pulse of the planet and be detectors of change and help us understand the health of the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cAs [animals] move these vast distances, they can collect detailed environmental information that can better inform climate models and collect information in places that are difficult to monitor,\u201d whether high in the sky, deep in the ocean, or under a thick layer of ice.",
            "ICARUS tags are solar-powered, whereas some existing tagging systems run on batteries, which can die \u2014 ending the research on that individual or requiring recapture to change them out. Other tagging systems rely on animals passing by a signal tower. It works for certain animals, like birds and bats, but not for others. \u201cBecause ICARUS is satellite-powered, you don\u2019t have to wait for your animal to go back on the grid and pass by a tower,\u201d said Lohr. Instead, each time a satellite passes over an area, data from nearby tagged animals will be uploaded to Movebank, an open-access database.",

            "Ultimately, researchers hope that ICARUS data can \u201chelp us pinpoint effective conservation strategies,\u201d Aikens said. \u201cIt can help us identify pinch points on the landscape.\u201d While this is already happening for some species, including North American ungulates like elk and pronghorn antelope, whose migrations researchers have tracked for years, for most of the planet\u2019s species \u201cwe lack this data and this wide coverage of information, which makes these fine-scale interventions a lot harder to achieve. That\u2019s a place that ICARUS can help fill in a lot of gaps.\u201d\n",
            "And if the internet of animals can zero in on specific issues \u2014 for instance, a bird species dying out because a particular insect it eats is being killed by a particular chemical being sprayed in an area \u2014 Wikelski believes such information could drive people to act. \u201cPeople are willing to do something about it if they know that what they do is really helpful,\u201d he said.\n",
            "For now, Wikelski continues to practice patience. When I spoke to him in early July, he was dealing with the latest hurdle: satellite launch delays, including one caused by a payload issue and another caused by an ill-timed summer holiday that delayed authorization of the $30,000 payment needed to secure a launch reservation. \u201cOur project is now too small to really be on everybody\u2019s horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, it was too large.\u201d",
            "Nevertheless, Wikelski was hopeful. His team was studying and perfecting the lowest-stress methods of tagging animals and even testing automatic tagging systems, like one for deer involving a salt lick and a tiny elastic band. He remained confident of ICARUS\u2019s potential.",
            "\u201cOne really important aspect we think is transformative in biology is the scaling up of tagging,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have one animal but 50 or 100, or you do it across a continent.\u201d Over the next two years he plans to tag 9,000 animals in Europe, including blackbirds, storm thrushes, swifts, and sparrows in a study already underway. Roughly 7,000 of those 9,000 would die in the first year, he said, based on general patterns. \u201cThat means we are finally understanding where they disappear. Where are the death traps? These tags are so smart, they can tell us if a female is nesting and if the clutch disappears. So we can not only get information on where the adults are living and dying, but have the adults been successful in hatching or clutching? Is there a massive problem in a certain area? Then we can link individuals to populations and understand the drivers of change.\u201d"

This extraordinary initiative \u2014 more than a dozen years in the making \u2014 is intended to save the imperiled northern spotted owl from extinction.\n",
            "Barred owls have been moving west into spotted owl territory for decades, aggressively outcompeting them for prey and nesting sites. If its plan is adopted, the federal agency will soon launch what\u2019s expected to be a three-decade campaign in which certified hunters will eventually shoot nearly half a million barred owls.\n",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re wildlife conservation professionals, and we don\u2019t take this lightly,\u201d said Bridget Moran, a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Bend, Oregon, who has been working on the strategy. \u201cThe spotted owl is at a crossroads. We have the science to indicate what we can do to conserve spotted owls, and [it\u2019s] telling us that we must manage barred owls in addition to habitat to save them.\u201d\n",
            "The plan, as presented in a final environmental impact statement, has garnered opposition, largely from animal welfare and anti-hunting groups, but also support from mainstream environmental groups. ",
            "The Fish and Wildlife Service adopted its plan based largely on a study of \u201cinvader removal,\u201d published in 2021, in which researchers set up five pairs of test plots. On one plot, they left barred owls and spotted owls to their own devices. On the other plot, they shot any barred owls that entered.",
            "BQA long-term field experiment showed that where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized.",
            "The researchers eliminated 2,485 barred owls over several years in the managed plots. Where barred owls and spotted owls were left alone, the population of the threatened species declined around 12 percent each year. Where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized.",
            "\u201cThe use of long-term field experiments to test the effectiveness of removals in benefitting impacted native species is rare,\u201d said David Wiens, a U.S. Geological Survey biologist and the lead author of the paper. \u201cThis study is the largest field experiment ever conducted on the demographic consequences of invasive competition between predatory birds.\u201d",
            "Steep population declines of northern spotted owls, which live only in old-growth and mature second-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, raised alarms more than 35 years ago. Continued logging of those forests, experts said at the time, would drive the bird to extinction. In June 1990, the bird was listed as a threatened species in the Pacific Northwest and logging in its habitat was restricted.\n",
            "The federal action created a storm of controversy, but it prevented the extinction of the spotted owl. Efforts to prevent the disappearance of the owl, then and now, are not just about protecting a charismatic predator. Spotted owls are an indicator species for the health of the old-growth ecosystem: If a forest has adequate populations of flying squirrels, mice, and salamanders to sustain spotted owls, the forest is likely to be diverse and healthy. Spotted owls only live in mature forests, while barred owls can thrive in both young and old forests and eat a far wider range of prey.",

But while the logging battles have died down, the new controversy over the proper response to what has been called an invasion of barred owls has heated up as the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s final decision nears.",
            "Biologists believe that the barred owl began moving out of eastern North America and across Canada with the westward movement of European settlers. In a two-part paper, the former FWS biologist Kent Livezey concluded that the lack of trees on the Great Plains created a barrier to owl movement until settlers appeared. They excluded fire from ecosystems, which eventually allowed forests to spread, and they planted trees on farms and in towns, all of which provided an expansion of roosting habitat. Wheat and other grain farms may have increased the numbers of mice and other prey.",
            "Barred owls were first observed in Washington, Oregon, and California in the 1970s, and today there are more than 100,000 of them living in the northern spotted owl\u2019s territory in those states, according to federal biologists.",
            "When barred owls move into spotted owl habitat, the impact is rapid and thorough. The interlopers are larger and more aggressively territorial. They drive spotted owls away from their nests and outcompete the smaller birds for food. At least half the spotted owls in the forests of the West have been lost to barred owls, says the Fish and Wildlife Service, and some places have lost three-quarters of their historic population. When barred owls colonized Redwoods State and National Parks in Northern California, starting in 1987, the spotted owls all but disappeared.",
            "BQBiologists considered capturing and sterilizing barred owls, but they would still return to their territory and displace spotted owls.",
            "The plan to shoot barred owls will protect the northern spotted owl, a subspecies that occurs in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia, which now has fewer than five northern spotted owls, including a lone female.",
            "The number of northern spotted owls in the United States isn\u2019t precisely known: Estimates put the population at just a few thousand. Its continuing decline, however, is steep. In areas where roughly 200 spotted owls lived in the early 2000s, only two or three birds remain, said Robin Bown, a FWS biologist in Oregon. The bird is currently listed as threatened. FWS scientists say it is warranted for listing as endangered, but the agency says such action is precluded because it must focus on higher priority species.\n",
            "The California spotted owl, another subspecies, was last year proposed for listing as endangered in the southern part of its range and threatened in the Sierra Nevada. Barred owls are just beginning their invasion of that bird\u2019s habitat, and the FWS strategy is to dispatch them as soon as they are detected. The Mexican spotted owl is listed as threatened in both the U.S. and Mexico but is not currently threatened by the barred owl.",
            "Though the plan to kill hundreds of thousands of owls is extreme, federal wildlife officials say other options simply aren\u2019t available. Capturing the birds and moving them elsewhere was contemplated. \u201cWe contacted the eastern states where barred owls are native, to see if they wanted barred owls back,\u201d said Bown. \u201cThey said \u2018no.\u2019 Their existing habitat is already full.\u201d Moving them could also spread disease and parasites.

In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature took the step of classing the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) as critically endangered.

The tiny, transparent, larvae are then carried on the current to Europe\u2019s Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs.

            "The eel\u2019s mysterious life cycle resists standard fisheries science. To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

But they are struggling to come up with solutions, since the reasons for the European eel\u2019s collapse are not straightforward. Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980. There are clearly a number of factors at play in this long decline, but the extent of each is uncertain.",
            "Overfishing, it seems, is only one piece of the puzzle, as shown by the failure of the EU\u2019s fishing regulations to produce a recovery. Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle. The recent surge of illegal trafficking of juveniles to Asia has surely put another dent in the population.",

What you need is a very controlled level of fishing, but we have to work on all the environmental factors.\u201d",

She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

            "The mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",
            "Kerr has been writing to the EU for over a decade and has spoken to gathered authorities at the Hague on the problem of illegal glass eel shipments. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to make eel become an EU priority in countertrafficking,\u201d he said. In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",
            "BQIn Sweden, the threat of hydropower plants to migrating eels is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing.",
            "Eel fishermen around Europe fear their livelihoods being put on hold by a fishing ban, and they argue that the authorities should be addressing other known mortality factors. In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years.

With their big eyes, they observe closely what\u2019s going on around them in reefs and on the ocean floor, tasting with their suction cups and changing the color of their skin to blend with their environment.",
            "For many people, such unique traits have made a Spanish company\u2019s more-than-four-year effort to raise octopods for food in factory-like conditions all the more horrific. In the farm planned for construction off Spain\u2019s Gran Canaria island, the animals would be kept in small, narrow cages stacked atop each other in a multistory industrial building. To kill the octopods, they would be placed in ice water at minus 3 degrees Celsius (27 degrees F). According to plans leaked to the BBC, the farm was designed to produce 3,000 metric tons of protein-rich meat from 1 million animals per year. ",

How intensively should we exploit them, either for food, science, or display, and how well are we protecting them?",
            "For centuries, humans have eaten octopods. But apart from their food value, the animals were considered so alien that they received only scant attention, even from science. In Europe, they were mainly regarded as monsters, rumored to sink ships. In the 19th century, Victor Hugo wrote, \u201cIf there are no limits to the imagination when it comes to creating something hideous, the octopus can be considered a masterpiece.\u201d But the more people observed and learned about these creatures in aquariums, the more their disgust turned to sympathy, even affection.",

People were taken aback when Billye, a Pacific giant octopus, quickly learned how to remove screw caps from jars at the Seattle Aquarium. After an octopus in Germany, which had become famous by predicting the outcome of World Cup soccer matches, died, newspapers around the world eulogized him. And in 2020, the Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher was watched by millions of viewers.",
            "Recent research has revealed that octopods can plan ahead, identify and remember humans individually, and solve complex tasks. Last year, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology showed that, just like humans, octopods have two very different sleep phases, one deep and one with increased bodily activity. Researchers even posit that they can dream. All of that is quite remarkable for a creature that lacks a spine and is more closely related to ants, slugs, and worms than to vertebrates. ",
            "Biologists know of about 300 species of octopods, inhabiting many different parts of the ocean, from coastal lagoons to depths of 5,000 meters. Some have a huge range, like the common octopus, which can be found in the tropics, subtropics, and in temperate waters. Some are extremely rare, like the roughy umbrella octopus, which is known only from a few locations near New Zealand\u2019s Chatham Islands.",

All octopods live for between one and three years, and after hatching their eggs, females die. Despite these characteristics, octopods show signs of intelligence usually attributed only to millions of years of intensively social lifestyles in mammals. Scientists are still struggling to understand how something so short-lived as octopods \u2014 which have no chance to learn from parents and peers \u2014 can perform its cognitive feats.",

In 2022, Rajewsky published a paper suggesting that the parallels between mammalian and octopod brains lie in their genetic programming \u2014 which is curious, because their last common ancestor, a primitive wormlike animal, lived more than 500 million years ago. But in their brain cells, cephalopods have mechanisms \u2014 called microRNAs \u2014 that are considered a prerequisite for intelligent behavior in mammals, too.",

            "This increased level of concern is in stark contrast to how octopods are dealt with in fisheries. Between 350,000 and 500,000 tons of between 20 and 100 different species of octopods are caught each year for human consumption, up from about 100,000 tons in the early 1970s, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n",
            "Octopods are often taken as bycatch in industrial-scale fishing operations, but they are not discarded, due to their monetary value. In more artisanal fisheries, especially along coastlines in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Portugal, they are the main target. Hunters go after the animals with traps that simulate safe hiding spaces. Spears are sometimes used in East Africa. In coastal communities, octopods can be an important source of protein and \u201ca crucial resource for the livelihoods of vulnerable people,\u201d according to Sustainable Fisheries, a U.S.-based NGO.",

            "But experts are deeply worried about the lack of an international management system and, in many parts of the world, coordinated catch restrictions. For whales and for some fish species, monitoring efforts lead to strict annual quotas, which are at least partly enforced. But for octopods, the global industry is in many circumstances running blind: they are harvested without knowledge of their species or reproductive capacity, according to a comprehensive assessment by a team of scientists led by Warwick Sauer, from Rhodes University in South Africa.\n",
            "For example, a study revealed that in a large part of the Atlantic, annual catches of the common octopus might have been five times higher than official statistics indicate. \u201cGlobal catch data for octopuses should be considered a very rough estimate of total harvest, and likely to be a considerable underestimate,\u201d the FAO warns.",
            "Along coastlines, national or regional rules may limit how often artisanal octopus fishers can go out to sea or set a minimum catch size to protect potential offspring. \u201cBut rules are only as good as controls, and in many areas these don\u2019t exist,\u201d says Daniel Oesterwind, a marine biologist with the Th\u00fcnen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries in Rostock, Germany, and a member of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council.

This is a hazard for their survival, too: \u201cIf one generation of spawners is entirely removed, the stock will cease to exist.\u201d In some parts of the world, efforts are underway to stabilize populations.

            "In other countries, local communities are managing their own systems. In the shallow reefs around the Tanzanian island of Songosongo, for example, the common octopus and large blue octopus live in small caves. Villagers have long used spears to bring the animals ashore. However, as octopods have increasingly been traded and exported, overexploitation has become a big problem. To address this, communities have started to manage the fishery collaboratively.",

To stop the downward trend in stocks, villages chose a way that was as simple as it was effective: they began to close the reefs for three months every year. \u201cIt was part of the traditional knowledge that octopods always live in a home for three months, grow up, and then move on,\u201d says Medard. The periodic closures, which gives the animals time to reproduce and grow, proved worthwhile. The average octopus catch has increased measurably, and with it, local income. At the same time, the reefs and their other inhabitants are better protected.\n",

",
            "With grassroots support from labor unions and Indigenous communities, he had mapped the complex networks of cattle farms responsible for illegal deforestation.

My country has more than 200 million cattle, and ranching is the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, where more than 40 percent of the cattle are raised. JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company.

So, at Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which was founded in 2008, we began to collect this public data on everything related to environmental, social, and labor issues. We started to cross-check the data so we could trace supply chains right from the ranch to consumers.",

So, in 2021, we hired researchers in Europe and the U.S., as well as Brazil, to visit stores to find Brazilian beef and take pictures of the seals and export tracking numbers. Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from. For us it was very important to go to the supermarkets and take pictures, and to have that clear evidence.",

            "Gomes: Yes. It is common to move cattle from farm to farm in Brazil, often three or four times. There can be legitimate reasons for doing this, because cattle raising is quite a specialized business. But it can also cover up a \u201cdirty\u201d trail.",
            "In theory there are rules to prevent the trading of cattle from illegal to legal areas.

            "There is a solar-powered revolution going on in the fields of India. By 2026, more than 3 million farmers will be raising irrigation water from beneath their fields using solar-powered pumps. With effectively free water available in almost unlimited quantities to grow their crops, their lives could be transformed. Until the water runs out. ",
            "The desert state of Rajasthan is the Indian pioneer and has more solar pumps than any other. Over the past decade, the government has given subsidized solar pumps to almost 100,000 farmers. Those pumps now water more than a million acres and have enabled agricultural water use to increase by more than a quarter. But as a result, water tables are falling rapidly. There is little rain to replace the water being pumped to the surface. In places, the underground rocks are now dry down to 400 feet below ground.\n",
            "That is the effective extraction limit of the pumps, many of which now lie abandoned. To keep up, in what amounts to a race to the bottom of the diminishing reserves, richer farmers have been buying more powerful solar pumps, leaving the others high and dry or forcing them to buy water from their rich neighbors.\n",
            "Water wipeout looms. And not just in Rajasthan.",
            "BQThe success of solar pumps is \u201cthreatening the viability of many aquifers already at risk of running dry,\u201d says a World Bank economist.",
            "Solar pumps are spreading rapidly among rural communities in many water-starved regions across India, Africa, and elsewhere. These devices can tap underground water all day long at no charge, without government scrutiny.",
            "For now, they can be great news for farmers, with the potential to transform agriculture and improve food security. The pumps can supply water throughout the daylight hours, extending their croplands into deserts, ending their reliance on unpredictable rains, and sometimes replacing existing costly-to-operate diesel or grid-powered pumps.",
            "But this solar-powered hydrological revolution is emptying already-stressed underground water reserves \u2014 also known as groundwaters or aquifers. The very success of solar pumps is \u201cthreatening the viability of many aquifers already at risk of running dry,\u201d Soumya Balasubramanya, an economist at the World Bank with extensive experience of water policy, warned in January.",
            "An innovation that initially looked capable of reducing fossil-fuel consumption while also helping farmers prosper is rapidly turning into an environmental time bomb.",

            "For much of the 20th century, artificial irrigation of farmland boomed thanks to state and World Bank investment in reservoirs and in networks of canals to bring water to fields. Irrigation watered the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d of new high-yielding but thirsty crops, keeping a fast-growing world population largely fed.",
            "But many systems have reached their limits. Rivers are being emptied, and new investment has dried up. So in the past three decades, hundreds of millions of farmers in hot arid regions, from Mexico to the Middle East and South Asia, have switched to getting their water from underground. ",
            "Boreholes sunk into porous water-holding rocks now provide 43 percent of the world\u2019s irrigation water, according to a study last year by the World Bank. Irrigation is responsible for around 70 percent of the global underground water withdrawals, which are estimated at more than 200 cubic miles per year. This exceeds recharge from rainfall by nearly 70 cubic miles per year. \n",
            "Monitoring of individual underground reserves is patchy at best. They are too often out of sight and out of mind. But a study of historical data from monitoring wells in 1,700 aquifers in 40 countries, published in January, reported that \u201crapid and accelerating\u201d declines in reserves were widespread.\n",
            "Scott Jasechko, a hydrologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, found water tables dropping by 3 feet or more every year in India, Iran, Afghanistan, Spain, Mexico, the United States, Chile, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. \n",
            "BQAid agencies and governments subsidize solar pumps to boost food production, reduce poverty, and cut fossil fuel emissions.",
            "The implications of this for the future are profound. \u201cGroundwater depletion is becoming a global threat to food security, yet \u2026 remains poorly quantified,\u201d says Meha Jain, who studies the sustainability of farming systems at the University of Michigan. But rather than calling a halt to groundwater withdrawals, policymakers are upping the ante by promoting solar power as a means of delivering yet more and cheaper underground water to fields. ",
            "The solar revolution on farms is happening with the best of intentions and is using a technology widely seen as environmentally beneficial. Farmers love the fact that their photovoltaic (PV) pumps do not require expensive and polluting diesel fuel or grid connections. Once installed, they can run all day at no cost, growing more food crops, or allowing their owners to expand their businesses \u2014 growing water-intensive cash crops, or earning income from selling spare water to neighbors. Many farmers also keep their old diesel or electric pumps to continuing pumping when the sun goes down.\n",
            "Development agencies and governments are equally keen. They subsidize solar pumps to boost food production, reduce poverty, cut emissions from fossil fuels, and curtail growing demands on overstretched electricity grids. But the long-term downside of this solar revolution looms large. \n",

            "The crisis is particularly stark in India. The world\u2019s most populous nation \u201cstands at the threshold of a revolution in adoption of solar irrigation pumps,\u201d says Tushaar Shah, a water economist for the International Water Management Institute. The government intends to raise the number of solar pumps more than tenfold to 3.5 million by 2026. ",
            "The country is already the world\u2019s largest consumer of groundwater, with farmers each year pumping onto their fields an estimated 50 cubic miles more water than the monsoon rains replace. Unchecked, says Shah, solar power is set to make the situation worse.\n",
            "Sub-Saharan Africa could soon be on the same path. Shallow groundwater is present below fields in many places across the continent. But the cost of buying diesel fuel is prohibitively high for many farmers, and most rural areas are not connected to electricity grids. So, the arrival of stand-alone PV pumps is \u201ca game-changer for small-scale farms\u201d in sub-Saharan Africa, says Giacomo Falchetta, an energy and environment economist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. ",
            " There are already half a million PV irrigation pumps watering fields across the sub-Saharan region. But Falchetta calculates that in the future 11 million more could be deployed to irrigate 135 million acres of currently rainfed fields \u2014 an area the size of France. These pumps could supply a third of the unmet water needs of small farmers, who produce most of the food across sub-Saharan Africa.",
            "BQSolar-powered farms in Yemen are pumping so hard they have triggered \u201ca significant drop in groundwater since 2018.\u201d",
            "The main thing preventing farmers from accessing the free water beneath their feet is the capital cost of the equipment, which typically represents up to a year\u2019s farm income. But that may soon change, as costs come down.",
            "\u201cThe potential in Africa is large,\u201d says Claudia Ringler, a water specialist at the Washington, D.C.-based International Food Policy Research Institute. \u201cSolar power is a breakthrough technology. Barriers will be increasingly overcome, and it will transform agricultural irrigation.\u201d",
            "Falchetta reckons horticultural crops will benefit most from the extra water made available by solar pumps, \u201cdue to their high water requirement and high economic value.\u201d But that rings alarm bells. Even modest falls in water tables in the continent\u2019s many shallow aquifers could dry up wells that sustain many of the 255 million people living in poverty above them, warns the World Bank.\n",
            "Such declines could also wreck fluvial ecosystems sustained by shallow underground water, including the wetlands and rivers on which millions of Africans depend for fish and other resources.\n",
            "Overexploitation of groundwater, the World Bank review concludes, is \u201ca classic tragedy of the commons \u2014 with exponential impacts disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable.\u201d Yet the bank, along with its sister agency the Africa Development Bank, is funding stand-alone solar pump projects in Togo, Niger, and elsewhere across the continent.",

            "In many places, however, farmers may not be able to wait for subsidies or aid projects to embrace solar pumps. They have little choice if they want to grow crops as other means of pumping water to their fields falter.\n",
            "That is certainly the case in Yemen, on the south flank of the Arabian Peninsula, where the desert sands have a new look these days. Satellite images show around 100,000 solar panels glinting in the sun, surrounded by green fields. Hooked to water pumps, the panels provide free energy for farmers to pump out ancient underground water. They are irrigating crops of qat, a shrub whose narcotic leaves are the country\u2019s stimulant of choice, chewed through the day by millions of men.",
            "For these farmers, the solar irrigation revolution in Yemen is born of necessity. Most crops will only grow if irrigated, and the country\u2019s long civil war has crashed the country\u2019s electricity grid and made supplies of diesel fuel for pumps expensive and unreliable. So, they are turning en masse to solar power to keep the qat coming. ",
            "The panels have proved an instant hit, says Middle East development researcher Helen Lackner of SOAS University of London. Everybody wants one. But in the hydrological free-for-all, the region\u2019s underground water, a legacy of wetter times, is running out. \n",
            "The solar-powered farms are pumping so hard that they have triggered \u201ca significant drop in groundwater since 2018 \u2026 in spite of above average rainfall,\u201d according to an analysis by Leonie Nimmo, a researcher until recently at the U.K.-based Conflict and Environment Observatory. The spread of solar power in Yemen \u201chas become an essential and life-saving source of power,\u201d both to irrigate food crops and provide income from selling qat, he says, but it is also \u201crapidly exhausting the country\u2019s scarce groundwater reserves.\u201d",
            "BQFarmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing diesel-powered pumps, rather than replacing them. ",
            "In the central Sana\u2019a Basin, Yemen\u2019s agricultural heartland, more than 30 percent of farmers use solar pumps. In a report with Musaed Aklan, a water researcher at the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies, Lackner predicts a \u201ccomplete shift\u201d to solar by 2028. But the basin may be down to its last few years of extractable water. Farmers who once found water at depths of 100 feet or less are now pumping from 1,300 feet or more.",
            "Some 1,500 miles to the northeast, in in the desert province of Helmand in Afghanistan, more than 60,000 opium farmers have in the past few years given up on malfunctioning state irrigation canals and switched to tapping underground water using solar water pumps. As a consequence, water tables have been falling typically by 10 feet per year, according to David Mansfield, an expert on the country\u2019s opium industry from the London School of Economics.\n",
            "An abrupt ban on opium production imposed by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers in 2022 may offer a partial reprieve. But the wheat that the farmers are growing as a replacement is also a thirsty crop. So, water bankruptcy in Helmand may only be delayed.",

            "\u201cVery little is known about the aquifer [in Helmand], its recharge or when and if it might run dry,\u201d according to Mansfield. But if their pumps run dry, many of the million-plus people in the desert province could be left destitute, as this vital desert resource \u2014 the legacy of rainfall in wetter times \u2014 disappears for good.",
            "\nEven the potential climate benefits of solar pumping may prove illusory, says the World Bank\u2019s Balasubramanya. In theory, switching from diesel or electricity to PV pumping should eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. But in practice, farmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing pumps, rather than replacing them. And, however it is pumped, the extra water available will also encourage farmers to adopt more intensive farming methods, using more fertilizer and machinery to grow thirstier cash crops, increasing the carbon footprint of the farm. ",
            "What is to be done? Groundwaters are notoriously hard to police. India\u2019s overpumping has been \u201ca colossal anarchy,\u201d says Shah. Some states have attempted to control non-solar pumps that run on grid electricity by restricting power supplies to farmers to a few hours every day. It had some effect, says Shah, who first proposed the idea. But many farmers responded by buying more powerful pumps.",
            "BQWhatever the technology, \u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\u201d",
            "Now, to combat the excesses of solar pumps, Gujarat state has been paying some farmers high prices to use their PV panels to send power to the grid, rather than pump water, making solar energy in effect a new cash crop.",
            "The pilot project was limited to just 4,300 wells, and again the benefit was \u201cmuted,\u201d says Shah. He believes a better designed scheme could work. But Balasubramanya, who until recently worked with Shah in India, is doubtful. She warns that it might simply encourage more farmers to invest in solar panels, which could end up increasing water pumping further. \n",
            "In any case, controls based around the electricity grid will not work in rural Africa, where there is rarely any grid for farmers to either tap into or supply.",
            "None of this should be seen as a condemnation of solar power, says Balasubramanya. \u201cThe fundamental problem is not the solar technology itself.\u201d Whatever the technology, \u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\u201d",
            "But Balasubramanya says technology could come to the rescue. If PV pumps had to be sold with sensors that allowed monitoring of their output, then regulators could directly limit their use. Whether governments would do that in practice, given the conflicting priorities between immediate food production and longer-term management of water, is another matter."

I am trying to make sure that people in communities that look like mine are registered to vote, are educated on the issues. On the national level, I\u2019m trying to go to states that have communities that look like mine to connect these issues so that people know these are not one-offs. Cancer Alley in Louisiana is not the only Cancer Alley in the United States. Other communities that look like mine are overrun with polluted air, polluted water. Flint, Michigan\u2019s water crisis is also happening in Sulphur, Louisiana. There\u2019s a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi.

But the fact that they still get up every day smiling, laughing, knowing the fight ahead, it gives me hope.

            "What will it mean for policymaking on environmental and other issues, practically speaking, if the U.S. Supreme Court jettisons the Chevron doctrine?",
            "This question is on the minds of legal observers and environmental advocates as they wait for the justices to decide two consolidated cases in which the court has been asked to overrule the famous precedent that has stood for four decades. That ruling, in the 1984 case Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council, says that where Congress has not expressed itself clearly, leaving gaps or ambiguities in federal statutes, agencies should be allowed to adopt the interpretation they prefer, so long as that interpretation is reasonable. ",
            "The cases now before the Supreme Court \u2014 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless Inc. v. Department of Commerce \u2014 were brought by commercial fishing groups challenging a National Marine Fisheries Service rule, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. If the court decides to scrap the Chevron doctrine, it could have major implications for environmental policymaking and regulation on issues ranging from air pollution and climate change to clean water rules, public lands management, endangered species protection, and more.\n",
            "BQOverturning Chevron would reduce government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments. ",
            "There are two very different perspectives on the Chevron doctrine, which largely determine whether one thinks it ought to be overruled. Critics say that Chevron gives policymaking discretion to unaccountable agency bureaucrats, allows presidents to abuse their executive authority, and encourages members of Congress to shirk their legislative responsibilities. They charge that Chevron is \u201creliance-destroying\u201d because it allows policy \u201cflip-flops\u201d between administrations and that it cannot be squared with the landmark Marbury v. Madison decision, which ruled that courts \u201csay what the law is\u201d and established the principle of judicial review. If one believes that there is always a single best answer to how to interpret a given statutory provision, and that a skilled enough legal interpreter can always produce that best answer, then overturning Chevron has some intuitive appeal. Why ever defer to an agency when judges can just decide? ",
            "Supporters of Chevron contest each of these claims. Congress inevitably leaves certain interpretive question unresolved, they say, which means that some statutory provisions are capable of different understandings. And democratically elected presidents charged with executing the law are entitled to use this ambiguity to advance their policy preferences. (This is otherwise known as the \u201celections have consequences\u201d argument.) They would note that agencies are amply accountable to multiple overseers and restricted by many legal, political, and institutional constraints. And they would reject the idea that Chevron is somehow responsible for legislative shirking or gridlock and point to House and Senate rules that make passing legislation exceedingly difficult, along with hyper-partisanship. While accepting that judicial review is legitimate and necessary, they would also say that nothing in the Constitution requires courts to decide all legal questions with no deference to expert regulators.",

            "To the claim that there is one discernible \u201cbest\u201d answer to every hard question of statutory interpretation, they would say no, sometimes Congress has not been clear (whether because political compromise requires some degree of unclarity; or because Congress is not prescient; or intentionally wishes to leave agencies room to adapt to change; or because of the limits of language), and there is more than one arguably best answer. From this point of view, Chevron is a sensible default rule of decision. It keeps courts from substituting their judgments for an agency\u2019s \u2014 and that is how it should be, since the agency charged with day-to-day implementation will better know what is reasonable in the run-of-the-mill case. ",
            "I support the defense of Chevron, as my past writings have made clear. Overturning or enfeebling Chevron would have negative consequences. It would further concentrate power in the judiciary; reduce the government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments, as well as to social and economic change; sow disruption and disorder in the lower courts; and undermine the regulatory stability on which the normal course of business depends. For example, courts rather than agencies would decide what pollution standards are \u201crequisite to protect the public health\u201d and allow for an \u201cadequate margin of safety,\u201d as the Environmental Protection Agency is mandated to do; what it means for an upwind state to \u201ccontribute significantly\u201d to the failure of downwind states to meet national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act; and whether \u201charm\u201d to an endangered species is limited to direct applications of force or can include habitat destruction.",
            "BQIf Chevron is abandoned, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read a statute.",
            "First, overturning Chevron would shift substantial power to the judiciary to have the last word on many important questions of policy that arise under federal law. It is more democratic for interpretive decisions, which inevitably involve policy discretion, to be made by agencies \u2014 which are part of an executive branch headed by an elected president, and subject to ongoing oversight by Congress \u2014 rather than by unelected judges. Deciding what qualifies as the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d or whether implementing an offshore drilling plan would \u201cprobably cause serious harm or damage\u2026 to the marine, coastal or human environment\u201d \u2014 as the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to do \u2014 depends on a combination of legal, factual, and policy determinations. Agencies have research- and information-gathering capacity, and relevant expertise in areas of regulatory complexity, that courts do not possess. They are also required to solicit, consider, and respond to comments on their regulatory proposals from industry and other stakeholders, including states. Companies and their trade associations can and do weigh in through this process to shape rules that affect them, and to require agencies to explain themselves.",

            "fCJustice Amy Coney Barrett has suggested overturning the Chevron doctrine could lead to a flood of litigation. \nTom Williams / CQ Roll Call via AP Images",
            "Some of the conservative justices have implied that overturning Chevron is necessary to protect congressional prerogatives and restore Congress to its rightful role in our separation of powers scheme. Yet Congress already has the means to constrain agency overreach and check the president\u2019s executive power. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress has required agencies to provide advance notice of their rules and can effectively cancel any rule before it takes legal effect through a fast-track, filibuster-proof process requiring only a majority vote. Congress can also make its wishes known in the annual appropriations process and can defund agency initiatives of which it disapproves. If anything, abandoning Chevron would make the presumed separation of powers imbalance worse, not better \u2014 Congress could still use vague language to avoid making hard policy choices, only now those policy choices would be made by courts.",
            "Second, without Chevron, it will be harder for agencies to adapt regulation to new circumstances, something we should want government to do. Under Chevron, agencies can consider the latest scientific advances and technology developments; re-examine costs and benefits; consult with stakeholders; and consider the president\u2019s policy preferences too, knowing that the next administration may adopt a different view \u2014 in which case the agency would then bear the burden of explaining to the public and the courts why that new understanding is also reasonable. But without Chevron, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read the statute, not only now but for all time, making it more difficult for a later administration to change its mind given new information or unforeseen conditions. Eliminating flexibility will not improve regulation. It will rigidify it and prevent the government from updating policy over time.",
            "BQAgency officials are more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges.",
            "Third, overturning Chevron is likely to inspire more litigation and instability in the lower courts. Releasing all federal judges from any obligation to defer to agencies will invite parties to challenge many more rules \u2014 not just the most significant ones \u2014 and relitigate thousands of interpretations that courts have already settled. Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised this concern at oral argument, when she suggested that a flood of litigation might ensue over long-standing interpretations, where courts already determined that Congress was not clear and deferred to agencies.",
            "Overturning Chevron will also undermine uniformity and consistency in the interpretation of federal law. Chevron is a familiar and useful tool for lower court judges \u2014 they understand and know how to use its framework. What might replace it? The most likely standard of review the Supreme Court would substitute is so-called Skidmore deference, which is the amount of deference an agency is due in the estimation of the reviewing court based on several considerations \u2014 a standard that provides lower courts little guidance and maximum flexibility. As Justice Elena Kagan said at oral argument, \u201cSkidmore has always meant nothing.\u201d Without Chevron, judges will wade into often unfamiliar and technically complex statutes armed with their dictionaries, textualist principles, and canons of construction. They may or may not give any respect to the agency\u2019s views. This situation cannot help but increase conflicts among the lower courts.",
            "*Haze_hangs_over_lower_Manhattan_last_July",
            "fCHaze hangs over lower Manhattan last July.\nGary Hershorn / Getty Images",
            "This prospect leads to a fourth and related point, which is that overturning Chevron is likely to be bad for business. Of course, many conservative opponents of regulation believe that Chevron enables more regulation on balance, so they would like to see it gone. But there is a decent possibility that the consequences for business will be, at best, mixed. A few high-profile politically controversial rules will always wind up in the Supreme Court. And for those, Chevron will hardly matter because the Court will simply decide, as it has shown a tendency to do. But overall, Chevron is a stabilizing force because of its effect on lower courts. Without Chevron\u2019s default presumption in favor of government, it will be more tempting for many would-be litigants \u2014 domestic and foreign companies, state attorneys general, public interest groups, other stakeholders \u2014 to challenge agency rules, even those that many, if not most, companies might be able to live with or which they might at least prefer to uncertainty. Unleashing a cacophony of inconsistent rulings on what various statutory provisions mean, issued by up to 850 federal judges with minimal expertise in technical areas undermines the stable conditions necessary for the private sector to thrive.",
            "The Supreme Court may not overturn Chevron after all, perhaps in part because of some of these considerations. It may limit its application to narrow circumstances or impose new threshold tests on when it can apply. But it is highly unlikely simply to reaffirm it, which would be the best outcome for democracy, good governance, and business. ",
            "At bottom, Chevron embodies an inclination \u2014 that federal agencies ought to be given the benefit of the doubt if they offer good reasons for interpreting a statute a particular way, when no one can say for sure what Congress would have wanted to do. That inclination depends on a belief that agency officials are both more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges, so that in such instances, agencies ought to be trusted to make the call. Coming to that conclusion requires judges to at least consider that there may be limits to their prowess and to allow that when it comes to complex regulatory statutes, where legal meaning and policy discretion are often intertwined, agencies can be legitimate legal interpreters. That attitude represents a certain faith in the capacity and competence of government that it would be a terrible shame to lose."
