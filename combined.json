            "Pollination is a step in a plant\u2019s life cycle that allows it to make seeds. It is the transfer of pollen from the male parts of a plant to the female parts. Some plants supply their own pollen. Others require pollen from another plant of the same species.",
            "Consider a flower. The male parts usually look like fluffy-tipped stalks. These are called anthers. Their job is to make pollen. The female part of a flower is called the pistil. It\u2019s often shaped like a little bowling pin. The pistil has a sticky tip that helps incoming pollen cling to it. Different plants rely on different strategies \u2014 such as wind, water or animals \u2014 to get pollen to their pistils.",
            "Some plants, especially flowering ones, rely on living things to help transfer pollen. Living things that play a role in pollen transfer are called pollinators. They include bats, birds and many insects \u2014 such as bees, moths and butterflies.",
            "Other plants mainly rely on wind for pollination. Corn, pine trees and most grasses are wind-pollinated. About 2 percent of plants rely on water for pollination. A group of aquatic plants called eelgrass (Vallisneria) is an example.",
            "Almost 90 percent of wild flowering plants depend on pollinators to some extent. Yet, many pollinator species are declining.

            "Paula B\u00fcrgisser and Giacomo Reina, scientists at EMPA, helped develop a new material that can kill germs when activated by light.",
            "Graphene is a wonder. This single layer of carbon atoms is stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. It conducts electricity better than many other materials. And recent studies now show it can even kill germs. A new graphene-based material is being developed to harness that surprising superpower.",
            "To turn on this germ killer, all you need is a little light. Exposing graphene to light starts a chemical reaction, says Giacomo Reina. That reaction produces molecules that can take down microbes such as bacteria, viruses or fungi.",
            "A materials scientist, Reina works at EMPA, a research institute in St. Gallen, Switzerland. He was part of a team that unveiled the new material last year in EcoMat.",
            "As a liquid, the substance could one day coat surfaces often rife with germs. Those might include doorknobs or handrails in hospitals. Right now, though, Reina\u2019s team wants to use it in the human mouth. It\u2019s a particularly germy place. Installing new dental implants can put someone at risk of infection. But coating the implant with this germ-fighting coating should greatly lower that risk.",

            "In the 22 years since graphene was discovered, scientists have probed and explored it in many ways. They\u2019ve even developed different types of useful graphene. It can add strength to concrete and tennis rackets. It can also boost the performance of electronic devices.",
            "Nowadays, Reina says, graphene is more \u201ca family\u201d of materials. His team used a type called graphene oxide. It\u2019s a layer of carbon atoms with oxygen-containing molecules attached. This formula mixes easily with water to form an acid.",

            "When light strikes it, the doped material responds in two ways. First, it warms \u2014 enough to kill certain microbes. But that light also triggers a chemical reaction between the doped graphene and oxygen in the air. This now creates a class of microbe-fighting molecules called radicals.",
            "Turning the doped material into a liquid that could be used to coat surfaces took more than a year of trial and error. The scientists had to answer many questions about how the light was interacting with it, Reina says. \u201cWhat happened with oxygen? What happened without oxygen? What kind of reaction are we generating? Does it work many times?\u201d",
            "To find out, the scientists compared the radicals produced by the doped material under different conditions. They also mixed the acid with a liquid plastic that could be easily spread on a surface.",
            "The resulting material, Reina says, improves on past anti-germ coatings. For instance, unlike others, this one uses no metals (which may need ultraviolet radiation to activate their germ-killing action).",
            "\u201cIt can become antimicrobial under just ambient light,\u201d says Sara Imani. She calls that a \u201cplus point\u201d for the new material.

            "Reina\u2019s group combined its material with bacteria in lab experiments and found that it could kill germs when bathed in infrared light. Those wavelengths are present in sunlight and some room lighting. They also tested the doped acid on a chemical that mimics living tissue, such as skin. It triggered no harmful reactions.",
            "Those tests suggest that the new material is safe for the human body, including the mouth. That\u2019s critical for how Reina and his colleagues intend to use it.",
            "Their team is now working with dentists and researchers to develop a \u201csplint.\u201d It\u2019s a type of tray filled with a liquid film that can fit over the teeth. Within a few minutes, the tray could coat teeth with the new graphene-based material. Then, light shined into the mouth would kick on its antimicrobial activity.",
            "The researchers have been testing the material against common infectious agents in gum tissue. One day, after having a dental procedure, someone might wear the splint and expose it to light. \u201cIt\u2019s something the patient can do at home,\u201d too, Reina says, to kill harmful germs in their mouth.",

Some also have developed resistance to drugs, such as antibiotics. These infections are now very hard to knock out. In fact, resistant infections kill more than 1.25 million people each year, according to the World Health Organization.",

Near a grassland water hole, they struck chunks of iron pyrite against flint to create sparks that lit campfires. And they did this on multiple occasions. A close look at remnants of those burns now shows they are the oldest clear evidence of ancient human relatives purposely making fire.",

Ashton is an archaeologist at the British Museum in London, England. His team analyzed these remains, which included fire-striking tools and chemical traces of the burns.",
            "Until now, the oldest known use of iron pyrite and flint to strike fire\u00a0came from northern France. Those artifacts were left by Neandertals a mere 50,000 years ago. The new discovery in Barnham, England, extends fire-making back another 350,000 years.\u00a0",
            "Ashton\u2019s group shared its findings in the January 15 issue of\u00a0Nature.",

            "The light and warmth of a campfire scared away predators. It provided a place for early humans to socialize at night. Cooking food could neutralize some toxins, extend the food\u2019s shelf life and make food easier to digest. All of that may have boosted human brain development.",
            "In the past, there were other human species related to our own, Homo sapiens. These close cousins were all part of the same group of species, known as the Homo genus. Neandertals (Homo neanderthalensis) were among these close relatives.",

A site in northern Israel\u00a0has remnants of hearths from about 780,000 years ago. But no fire-striking tools were found in these places.

            "Three years later, the team found bits of iron pyrite. Those shards can be used to strike sparks. But it was unclear whether they had arrived at the site naturally or were brought there.",
            "In 2021, the team had \u201cthe first proper breakthrough,\u201d Ashton says. He spotted reddened clay in a long-overlooked area. \u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m sure that looks like heated or burnt sediment.\u2019\u201d",

            "\u201cI\u2019ve been generally skeptical of fire-making claims,\u201d says Dennis Sandgathe. But finding chunks of iron pyrite near fire residues is \u201ca pretty compelling argument that they\u2019re making fire.\u201d Sandgathe is an archaeologist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada.",

Then, she hurt her shoulder playing high school softball.\u202f\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to walk away from [sports],\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially when growing up, I feel like playing sports was all I did.\u201d\u202f\u00a0",

            "It wasn\u2019t until my sophomore year in college that I heard about biomechanics. I took a biomechanics class, and someone came and talked to us about different careers in the field. I learned that biomechanists interact with physical therapists, athletic trainers, team doctors, strength and conditioning coaches, team coaches and athletes. That\u2019s what was really enticing about the field. I didn\u2019t have to pick one career direction and could combine my interests.\u00a0",
            "In my senior year, I found a biomechanics research lab online. I literally just cold-called them. They were willing to take me on as an intern. That\u2019s where I really fell in love with the research side of biomechanics. I got hands-on experience with what that field looks like.\u00a0",
            "After grad school, my university asked me to stay for my Ph.D. That was a tough decision. I didn\u2019t know anyone who had their Ph.D. It was just such a new world and field, and it was never something that I had considered. I ended up staying. I taught some undergraduate biomechanics lab classes. I loved helping students identify a passion for biomechanics and understand its purpose. And that\u2019s what led me to ultimately want to be a professor.\u00a0",
            "We work with teams and individual athletes. For example, we had the baseball team come in for testing. In the biomechanics lab, athletes can do jumps, throwing and hitting. We also have these machines that measure things like hip and shoulder range of motion, quadriceps and hamstring strength, shoulder rotation strength and grip strength. And then we take all that information and use prior research to help us identify areas where the athlete could improve. These things are usually hard to see with the naked eye.\u202f\u00a0",

You need to understand physics and how to apply it to the body. And then you tie in anatomy and physiology, both of which are very complex fields on their own.\u00a0",
            "There\u2019s also an education piece that\u2019s a challenge with everyone that you work with, because no one knows what biomechanics is. Those who use older coaching styles might be hesitant to buy into it. Same thing with professional sports teams. It\u2019s growing in popularity, but it really started in Major League Baseball. Other professional teams are waiting to see what happens before accepting it. And so there\u2019s a hesitancy to take the leap to either get into the field, to hire a biomechanist or to go and see a biomechanist. \u00a0",

            "The electric jolts were fairly small. Each was only about as strong as the shock from touching a doorknob on a dry, winter day. Still, they could pose a risk to future astronauts and electronics. They also could make it harder to search for Martian life.",
            "It\u2019s \u201clike mini-lightning,\u201d explains Baptiste Chide. This planetary scientist works at the University of Toulouse in France. These discharges are\u00a0\u201ccentimeter-scale electric arcs,\u201d he says. Each one that his team detected produces a crack and a shock wave.",
            "There are thousands of kilometers (miles) of dust-storm fronts on Mars that can make these jolts, Chide says. So \u201cwe think there are plenty of these small discharges happening.\u201d",
            "When airborne particles slide against or bump into each other, their surfaces can become charged. (This is similar to what happens when you rub two balloons together.) On Earth, countless such interactions occur within sandstorms and\u00a0volcanic ash plumes. Particle collisions build up electrical fields that eventually discharge as arcs of electricity.",
            "The phenomenon is called triboelectricity (TRY-boh-ee-lek-TRIS-ih-tee).",
            "For decades, lab tests and computer models had hinted at triboelectricity flashes within dust storms and dust devils on Mars. But none had confirmed it.",
            "Chide and his colleagues previously\u00a0recorded the sounds of a Martian dust devil. In them, they heard a loud clicking. At the time, they thought it was the sound of dust grains striking the microphone. But one day, Chide heard other scientists at a conference discuss Martian triboelectricity. That led to a shocking realization: Those clicks might have been zaps.",
            "To find out, his team modeled the electrical interference that the rover\u2019s microphone would pick up from a nearby discharge. Then they compared that to the actual interference the mic had picked up.",
            "In this recording taken by NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover, you first hear the rumble of a gusting dust devil. Then, around 10 seconds in, you can hear the sputtering clicks generated by an electrical discharge. ",
            "The signatures matched perfectly.",
            "Excited, the researchers reviewed 28 hours of recordings taken over two Martian years. A total of 55 discharges occurred within about two meters (6.5 feet) of the microphone. Most occurred at the windiest times. Sixteen showed up during dust devils.",
            "The largest zap packed 40 millijoules of energy, the scientists estimate. That\u2019s similar to the zap of an electrical bug swatter.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that it was an electrical signal that they measured,\u201d says Joshua M\u00e9ndez Harper. This electrical engineer at Portland State University in Oregon did not take part in the new work. But M\u00e9ndez Harper wonders if the rover may have influenced those electrical signals. Triboelectricity likely happens on Mars anyway, he says. But it might behave differently around a metal spacecraft.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The jolts won\u2019t kill astronauts, Chide points out. But they could degrade spacesuits over time. Or they might disrupt spacecraft electronics and instruments.",
            "What\u2019s more, zaps could get in the way of searching for\u00a0evidence of Martian life. The discharges may spark a reaction that creates oxidants. These types of chemicals can destroy organic molecules, Chide says. And they might be signs of life.",
            "Percy is gathering rocks and soil for a future spacecraft to bring back to Earth. Those samples\u00a0are likely protected. Some are nestled safely inside the rover\u2019s metal skeleton. Others have been left behind on the ground inside metal tubes that should shield them from electricity, Chide says. Still, any of them might have been zapped prior to collection.",
            "\u201cThis discovery calls for a next generation of instruments dedicated to measuring electric fields at the surface of Mars,\u201d Chide says. That could help scientists find out how much electricity is zipping through the Red Planet\u2019s atmosphere. And that could reveal more about what its effects might be.\u00a0",

            "For one thing, it explains why objects\u2019 speed can affect how they experience the passage of time. We do not notice this in our daily lives, because the difference is so small. But when something moves very fast through space, it moves more slowly through time. The clock literally ticks more slowly for it. This is called time dilation.",
            "The spacetime model also explains why objects\u2019 masses can affect time.",
            "Physicists often imagine spacetime as a \u201cfabric.\u201d Extremely massive objects can \u201cdent\u201d this fabric, causing other objects to fall toward them. That\u2019s the force we experience as gravity. But because space and time are interwoven, massive objects don\u2019t just \u201cdent\u201d space. They also \u201cdent\u201d time. The result is that time slows down near massive objects, where gravity\u2019s pull is strongest.",
            "This idea is explored in the 2014 film Interstellar. Astronauts in the film explore a distant planet near a black hole.

            "Gravity affects satellite clocks as well. The lower gravity they experience in orbit causes those clocks to gain 45 microseconds each day.",
            "When these effects are combined, the net time difference between clocks on Earth and in orbit is 38 microseconds. Engineers take this into account when setting satellite clocks.

            "Your hands and feet mirror each other. They have chirality. This means one can\u2019t exactly overlap the other. Most shoes and gloves only fit well onto one or the other foot or hand. This same pattern of something being right- or left-handed matters even on the small scale of molecules.",
            "Have you ever put a shoe onto the wrong foot? Usually, you notice straight away that something\u2019s wrong \u2014 it doesn\u2019t fit quite right. That\u2019s because your two feet (and your two shoes) have opposite shapes. One is a mirror image of the other.",
            "In chemistry, biology and materials science, such mirroring is called chirality (Ky-RAAL-ih-tee). And this mirroring shows up even at the tiniest of scales, among molecules.",
            "\u201cMolecules have shapes,\u201d says Kate Adamala. She\u2019s a synthetic biologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. A molecule is made up of an assortment of atoms that combine together.",
            "With most simple molecules, such as water (H2O), there\u2019s only one way for the atoms to combine. They can only make one shape. So water is achiral. It does not have chirality.",
            "But many larger, more complex molecules have atoms that can combine in more than one way. Sometimes, the atoms connect in a different order. Or they may connect in the same order but fold or twist into different 3-D shapes. All these alternate ways for a molecule to form are called isomers.",
            "Chirality is a special feature of some isomers where the same atoms connect in the same order but with mirror-image shapes. Two chiral forms are made from the same stuff, but just like your two feet, their shapes won\u2019t overlap perfectly. The two mirrored versions of the molecule are known as the left- and right-handed forms.\u00a0",
            "Just as shoes need to fit onto feet to be useful, molecules often need to fit into other molecules to have an effect. An achiral molecule, like water, will react the same way with either form of a chiral molecule. But chiral molecules react very differently with the opposite forms of other chiral molecules.",
            "\u201cDepending on the molecules, the reaction may work well, [or] it may not work as well. It may make different products. And it may not work at all,\u201d says Vincent Maloney. He\u2019s an organic chemist who retired from Purdue University in Fort Wayne, Ind.",
            "Opposite, chiral forms can lead to drastically different effects. You can experience a simple example of this with a quick trip to the kitchen.",
            "Sniff a stick of mint gum and a fresh loaf of rye bread. They smell completely different. But these two scents come from the same molecule, called carvone. The scent receptors in your nose are chiral, explains Maloney. So they react differently to the mirror-image forms of carvone. The right-handed version of the molecule occurs naturally in spearmint, which gives chewing gum its minty scent. And the left-handed version is found in caraway, the seeds that flavor rye bread. \u00a0",
            "Most of the molecules that make up living things are chiral. But bodies only make one of the two possible chiral forms. DNA always twists to the right. The sugar glucose \u2014 the body\u2019s main source of energy \u2014 is right-handed, too. Proteins are the workhorses of biology, and these are formed from amino acids. Just one amino acid, glycine, is achiral. The rest of the amino acids our bodies make are all left-handed.\u00a0",
            "The chiral shape of a molecule is \u201cincredibly important for all of biology \u2014 for all of life on Earth,\u201d says Adamala.",
            "*a_photo_of_two_colleagues_in_a_laboratory_wearing_gloves_and_handling_vials",
            "fCKate Adamala (right) and her colleague Nathaniel Gaut (left) are synthetic biologists. They have worked on engineering simple versions of living cells. Understanding chiral molecules is very important for this type of work.  ",
            "The body\u2019s reactions to mirror-image molecules are highly important in medicine.",
            "Medicines often work because the shape of a drug molecule fits into a shape on a target. That target may be a problematic enzyme in a person\u2019s body or a disease-causing germ. The drug can disable the enzyme or germ \u2014 but only if it has the right shape. And one chiral form of a drug molecule may be the right shape while the other, chiral form doesn\u2019t fit.",
            "Making a drug with just one chiral form can be a painstaking process. To make a drug, chemists can trigger a series of chemical reactions to get substances to combine in just the right way. But most known triggers, called catalysts, are achiral. So they produce a hodge-podge mix of both left- and right-handed forms of a desired chiral molecule. The mixture is called a racemate (Ray-SEE-mayt).",
            "Drug makers often sell a medicine as a racemate, even though only one of the chiral forms in the mixture does the job. The opposite form may do nothing at all inside the body. But in some cases, it can be harmful.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Back in 1957, women in Europe began taking the drug thalidomide for nausea during pregnancy. The drug calmed their symptoms. But it also caused many babies to be born with missing or deformed arms and legs and other serious health problems.",
            "Research eventually revealed that only the right-handed form of the drug eased nausea. The left-handed form harmed developing babies. Plus, the right-handed form could morph inside the body to become the left-handed form. So neither form is a safe medicine for pregnant people.",
            "Drug makers today have to test both forms of a chiral molecule to prove they are each safe. Many drugs are still racemates. But others are carefully crafted to include only the most effective chiral form of a molecule. Or drug makers can carefully filter out one chiral form from a racemate. Both processes can be slow and expensive.",
            "Making a single chiral form \u201cis a pain in the lower back,\u201d says Adamala.",
            "But \u201cwe\u2019re getting better and better at it,\u201d says Maloney.",
            "Lab-made, or synthetic, drugs almost always form a racemate. But if the wanted substance is a biomolecule \u2014 one that forms naturally \u2014 then there\u2019s another option. Chemists can coax living bacteria to make it.",
            "Living things can only make one chiral form of a biomolecule. For example, they make right-handed DNA and proteins formed from left-handed amino acids. This is true of people, animals, plants and even fungi and bacteria.",
            "And, only the natural chiral form of a biomolecule can react with the body\u2019s chemistry. One made from ingredients that twist or bend the wrong way typically won\u2019t interact with body systems. It\u2019s like a stealthy ninja.",
            "This fact is something many drug makers want to take advantage of. Drugs often fail to work well because the body recognizes them as not part of itself. The result can be a drug that fails to work because the stomach digests it. Or there could be problematic side effects because the immune system attacks it. A wrong-handed ninja molecule can reach a target in the body without being detected along the way. And biologists can carefully craft it so it can still fit onto its target. So these kinds of drugs could be safer and more effective.",
            "But, as we learned above, single chiral forms are tough to manufacture. It can take hours to days to make a few micrograms of a mirror version of one of life\u2019s molecules.",
            "*an_illustration_showing_DNA_and_it's_mirror_left-handed_form",
            "fCMARK GARLICK/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images",
            "All DNA twists to the right, as depicted on the right side of this illustration. A mirrored left-handed form, as shown on the left, doesn\u2019t exist in nature.",
            "To speed things up, scientists once imagined creating something they call mirror life. This would be a bacterium whose DNA and amino acids all twist or branch the opposite way. It would be a new form of life that had never existed before. And it could crank out biomolecules with the opposite chiral form.",
            "Mirror life would be sort of like something from the Upside Down in the TV show Stranger Things. It would look like a normal living thing, but its chemistry would work the opposite way. And it turns out that, just like in the show, the upside-down variety of life could be very dangerous.",
            "A single mirror molecule that twists the wrong way can be useful. But as soon as you make mirror bacteria, they could do what life does and \u201cmake more of themselves,\u201d Adamala says. That\u2019s a huge problem because no life on Earth has evolved alongside such organisms. That means \u201cnothing eats them, and nothing makes them sick,\u201d says Adamala. So they could potentially spread out of control. (They\u2019d be able to eat normal, non\u2013mirror life food because bacteria can feed on very simple, achiral molecules.)",
            "Perhaps we normal lifeforms would manage to adapt, and something would evolve to eat or kill the mirror bacteria. But what if that doesn\u2019t happen? Adamala and a large group of other experts around the world have agreed to stop all efforts toward developing mirror life.",
            "While it might be cool to create a new form of life, the risks are too dire. And \u201cresponsibility in science is as important as innovation,\u201d says Adamala.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Chirality is important for more than just biology and medicine. In materials science, chirality can affect properties such as toughness or flexibility. Most plastics form from long chains of molecules. If the molecules are chiral and all line up in the same direction or in a regular pattern, this can make the material harder and tougher. But if the chiral molecules pile together randomly \u201clike spaghetti,\u201d says Maloney, the material will be softer.",
            "In other cases, the molecules that make up a material may not be chiral themselves. But the way these molecules pack together forms structures that twist in a specific way. The way the structures within a material twist can give it special properties. For example, it might react with sound or light differently. Or it might conduct electricity differently.",
            "These and other exciting possibilities inspire new efforts to make mirror molecules. A simple twist can make a world of difference in medicines, materials and more."

But unlike other teens, Violet can turn invisible. So she can actually vanish when the boy she likes looks her way.\u00a0",
            "Characters with invisibility powers \u2014 like Violet, the Fantastic Four\u2019s Invisible Woman and H.G. Wells\u2019 Invisible Man \u2014 can do all sorts of cool things. Escape embarrassing situations. Snoop on other people. Get into places where they\u2019re not allowed. It\u2019s no wonder why invisibility is one of the powers kids most wish for. Many animals, too, find it helpful to hide in plain sight. And though it\u2019s out of reach for people, some animals are nearly transparent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Being invisible is useful for animals that spend a lot of time in places with no good hiding spots, like the air or open ocean, says Kate Feller. She studies vision and behavior at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The secret to invisibility is all about light. \u201cThe way we see things is when light is reflected back off of an object onto our eyes,\u201d says Feller. The more light that can pass through something undisturbed, the harder it is to see that thing.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Light can\u2019t easily pass through most animals, Feller says. Light that hits our bodies usually gets absorbed or bounced around. But animals with nearly invisible body parts have figured out tricks to get around this.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "A lot of animals get their colors from molecules called pigments. These compounds appear different colors depending on which wavelengths of light they absorb and which they reflect. Green pigments, for instance, reflect green light and absorb all other colors. Human hair and skin get color from the pigment melanin. For an animal to vanish in plain sight, it needs to get rid of these colorful compounds.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Most baby fish lack pigments. This helps them hide from predators when they are too small to swim fast. They typically develop pigments as they grow up. Yet some species stay see-through their whole lives. One is the ghost catfish (Kryptopterus vitreolus). Its head has pigments, but its body is almost fully transparent. Seen from far away, it looks like a floating head!\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Some body parts are hard to hide. Eyes need pigments that absorb light so an animal can see. And even clear stomachs will show up if animals eat colorful food. Ghost catfish eat only small bits of food and \u201chide\u201d their meals in a long, thin, tube-shaped stomach, says Qibin Zhao. This physicist and material scientist studies ghost catfish at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.\u00a0",
            "Blood can\u2019t be transparent, either. The molecules that carry oxygen have colored compounds. (The one in our blood, hemoglobin, makes it red.) So up close, the ghost catfish\u2019s vessels are still visible.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Glass frogs have a clever way around this. When these mostly clear frogs sleep, they cram almost 90 percent of their blood cells into their liver. This makes their belly skin two to three times more transparent than it would otherwise be. Scientists think the frogs do this so that predators don\u2019t snack on them while they nap.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Even pigment-free objects are not entirely invisible. Light travels at different speeds through different materials. As a result, light zipping through one material will bend or bounce when it hits another material. Light bouncing off an animal makes it shine, just like the sun reflecting off a puddle.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Some animals\u2019 see-through parts are nearly reflection-free. Glasswing butterflies, for instance, have wings that are almost fully transparent. Their wings have fewer reflective scales than other butterflies\u2019 wings. The wings are also covered in tiny wax bumps. These bumps soften light\u2019s transition from air to tissue, allowing it to pass through the wing mostly undisturbed.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Tiny amphipod crustaceans do a similar thing, says Feller. These animals are so transparent you could read text right through their bodies. Their shells are covered with little round bacteria. These may create a smoother path for light, like the wax bumps on glasswing butterflies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Even when light makes its way inside the body, an animal isn\u2019t necessarily in the clear. Each cell in the body is full of many components that bend light as it passes through. Light then scatters around the body, making things look foggy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The more tissue that light needs to pass through, the foggier things get, says Zhao. That\u2019s why most invisible animals are pretty thin. Ghost catfish are only some 2 to 3 millimeters (about one-tenth of an inch) thin. See-through amphipods, a tiny crustacean, are similarly thin.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "These animals also use other tricks to help their tissues scatter less light. \u201cIt\u2019s about having fewer opportunities for light to do anything other than pass through it,\u201d says Feller.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Muscles pose a particular challenge. They have lots of little structures that are great at scattering light.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Transparent shrimp have muscles with large myofibrils. These are the bundles of proteins that make muscles contract. Having fewer bundles that are very large, rather than a bunch of small myofibrils, results in fewer surfaces to scatter light.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ghost catfish use a similar strategy. Their muscles are made of large flat plates stacked on top of each other, instead of the little round fibers most fish have. This design gives light fewer chances to bend and bounce around.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "In theory, we could draw on the same tricks to vanish: Don\u2019t let light bounce around in your body. The Invisible Man in H.G. Wells\u2019 story was a physicist who studied light refraction. He became invisible by changing how much his body bent light.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But that would be hard for a person \u2014 or any land animal \u2014 to do in real life. Animals are mostly water, Zhao says. Light doesn\u2019t bend that much when passing from water into a sea creature. But going from air into an animal\u2019s body, it bends a lot \u2014 making invisibility much harder on land.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Our solar system is peppered with large rocks, called asteroids. If a big asteroid plummets to Earth, there are many possible outcomes. The space rock could splash into the ocean and not harm anyone, for instance. Or it could wipe out a city. People have a hard time understanding the chances of an asteroid strike. So a team calculated the likelihood and compared it with other events \u2014 with some surprising results.",
            "\u201cIf a large or a medium asteroid were to hit the Earth, it would be something that almost everybody on the planet would be aware of,\u201d says Carrie Nugent. She\u2019s a planetary scientist at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass. While killer asteroids have hit before, such as the one that finished off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, Nugent says not to worry. \u201cWe try to put this event, which is actually a preventable event, in context with other preventable events.\u201d",
            "Nugent worked with six undergraduate students from Aalborg University in Denmark. Using a computer program, they simulated a group of asteroids similar to real near-Earth objects. They fed these modeled asteroids into a program called JPL Horizons. Anyone can use that program to look up predicted locations for objects in the solar system. For this project, the students determined whether each simulated asteroid would cross paths with Earth.",
            "That allowed the team to estimate the frequency of asteroids bigger than 140 meters (460 feet) across. That\u2019s around the size of a small cruise ship, Nugent says. An asteroid of this size would hit Earth roughly every 11,000 years. The researchers shared their findings August 12 in the Planetary Science Journal.",
            "That number is still pretty hard to understand. So Nugent compared the chances of an asteroid hitting Earth with other events that people may experience. The chances of being alive during an asteroid strike, she found, are higher than that of being struck by lightning. But a person is more likely to die in a car crash.",
            "Some events were rare but deadly. People \u2014 kids in particular \u2014 can die in dry sand hole collapses. This can happen when someone digs a large hole in sand, often at the beach. That hole can fall in on itself and take its digger down with it. \u201cIt is an extremely rare cause of death that most people don\u2019t even know about,\u201d Nugent says.",
            "Books and movies often portray asteroid run-ins as unstoppable events. \u201cThe truth is actually entirely the opposite,\u201d she says. NASA\u2019s DART Mission in 2022, for instance, bopped an asteroid that wasn\u2019t in danger of hitting Earth. The test changed the asteroid\u2019s path. This showed that people might be able to do this one day with a rock headed for our planet and avert a collision. So, Nugent says, it\u2019s important to do research, such as sky surveys, that locate these objects. \u201cThis is the one natural disaster we can totally prevent,\u201d she says.",
            "Nugent\u2019s team calculated the chances of near-Earth object (NEO), such as asteroids, hitting Earth in a person\u2019s lifetime. They compared this with the likelihood of other preventable events. The chance of an asteroid hitting the Earth is shown by the blue marker. The chance of such an asteroid killing a person is shown by the vertical blue bar.",

The x-axis gives the one-in-X chance that an event happens to an individual or the planet. For instance, the chance of being hit by lightning is 1-in-11,000. The y-axis gives the one-in-Y chance that a person dies if the event happens. So someone hit by lightning has a 1-in-10 chance of dying.",
            "Unlike most graphs, the label numbers on the x-axis get smaller moving to the right. And on the y-axis, they get smaller going up. This is because a one-in-X number is like a fraction with \u201c1\u201d on top and the \u201cX\u201d number on the bottom.

So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that footwear scientists in South Korea have been hard at work building a better bobsled shoe for their home team.",
            "Bobsledding is one of the fastest winter sports. Only 0.001 second can make the difference between bringing home a silver medal or gold. That\u2019s in a race that only takes 60 seconds. And the most important part of that race takes place in just the first six seconds.",
            "In bobsled, one, two or four athletes race down a track in an enclosed sled, propelled just by gravity. Most of a team\u2019s success depends on what it does before the clock even begins. That\u2019s during the first 15 meters (49 feet) of the \u201cpush start\u201d \u2014 when they push the sled across the icy track, just before jumping in. Shortening the time by just 0.01 second could shorten the finishing time by 0.03 second, recent studies have shown.

Harrison used to be a bobsled racer (and probably would have gone to the 2018 Winter Olympics if he hadn\u2019t hurt his foot last fall). He also studied the bobsled push start as a graduate student at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. Now, as a sports physiologist, he studies how physical activity affects the body.",
            "Being fast helps with the push start, but it\u2019s not enough. Bobsled athletes also have to be strong, especially in the legs, Harrison notes. Large tissue fibers known as fast twitch muscles help with short, powerful bursts of movement. That\u2019s why sprinters make for good bobsledders. Their muscles are already primed for these fast starts.",
            "The athletes need to keep their knees and feet low to the ground during the push start. This ensures they don\u2019t waste time and energy bringing the foot back around. Instead, their foot \u2014 and their shoes \u2014 spend more time pushing against the ice.",
            "And that\u2019s why a bobsledder\u2019s shoes are incredibly important. Similar to track cleats, these shoes have spikes on the soles. But instead of six or eight large spikes, they have at least 250 small ones. Those spikes help grip the ice, giving the athlete more traction to propel themselves forward.",
            "Nearly every bobsled team member wears the same brand of shoes. They\u2019re from Adidas, the only company that makes them for the sport. But those shoes may not be best for everyone, Harrison points out, since not every person is shaped the same.",

            "Park\u2019s group started by filming bobsledders. High-speed cameras focused on the feet as athletes ran wearing various shoes. Each shoe had reflective markers attached to the front and middle. This let the researchers see how the front of the foot bent in different shoes.",
            "That bend is key.",
            "As running speed increases, the foot bends more. This provides the driving force and spring that propels the athlete forward. If shoes don\u2019t allow the foot to bend enough, they can limit the foot\u2019s motion and limit an athlete\u2019s performance.",
            "But the researchers found that shoes that were the most flexible weren\u2019t the best. Ones with soles that had harder middle and outer layers helped the athletes run faster. The team published its initial findings in 2016.",
            "\u201cA stiffer shoe will transfer force better to the ground,\u201d Harrison notes. In most people, the big muscles in the legs will overpower the little muscles of the feet. But a stiffer sole allows the foot to become artificially stronger, allowing a faster start. The foot needs to bend, but it also needs to be strong.",
            "Soles aren\u2019t the only important part of a shoe. Some shoes, including bobsled shoes, point slightly upward at the toes. This is known as the \u201ctoe spring angle.\u201d",
            "After their first study, the Korean group went back to the bobsledders. This time, they tested them in shoes having three different toe angles: 30, 35 and 40 degrees. Shoes with the greatest toe-spring angle \u2014 40 degrees \u2014 led to the best performances, they showed. These shoes gave bobsledders the best bend to their feet, driving them forward and shortening their start time. The scientists shared their new findings in September 2017 Korean Journal of Sport Biomechanics.",
            "Harrison says a good bobsled shoe needs to be stiff, but also to bend enough to allow athletes to lean the shins and body forward and down during the first 10 meters (33 feet). \u201cIt looks like [the Koreans] accomplished that in a big way,\u201d he says.",
            "This shoe research could improve start times for the Korean bobsledders by 6 to 10 hundredths of a second. \u201cThat can certainly be the difference in making the medals or not,\u201d Harrison says."

            "\u201cYou can think of it as a very complicated surround-sound system,\u201d says Luke Cox. An acoustic levitator may contain hundreds of little speakers. Those speakers typically blare noise at a frequency of 40 kilohertz. Humans can\u2019t hear these sounds. \u201cBut if you look at the sound-pressure levels, it\u2019s louder than a jet engine,\u201d notes Cox. A mechanical engineer, he leads the company Impulsonics in Bristol, England.",
            "Sound waves from an acoustic levitator create alternating spots in the air of high- and low-intensity noise. The force of sound pushes objects away from the loud areas. As a result, items placed in quiet areas will stay there, as if tucked into invisible pockets. Fine-tuning the noise blasted by each speaker can steer those pockets around.",

            "This acoustic levitator uses sound waves to steer millimeter-sized objects through the air. It can juggle up to 25 objects at once. The device is shown in a computer simulation on the right. It uses two grids of ultrasonic speakers (rainbow-colored dots at top and bottom) to create a field of sound waves (reddish pattern in the middle). In this sound field, particles get trapped in fairly quiet regions (black) between very loud regions (white).",
            "Acoustic levitation can lift all types of materials, solid or liquid. But it can only support very small, lightweight things. Some of the heaviest stuff to ever surf sound waves were Styrofoam puffs (like those inside beanbag chairs).",
            "Taller and wider objects need longer, lower-frequency sound waves to cradle them. Say you wanted to levitate a person \u2014 even someone curled into a ball. Cox estimates that would take at least 275-hertz waves, which are 1.25 meters (some 4 feet) long. Bass guitars play notes about that low. But the music from a bass-guitar levitator would also have to be devastatingly loud to lift someone off their feet.\u00a0",
            "\u201cI\u2019m probably going to need quite a few power plants\u201d to run the device, Cox muses. \u201cBut maybe a big nuclear one could do it.\u201d",

            "Perhaps the most striking display of that brute strength is a maglev train. Magnets on its cars and tracks interact to create an upward force. It lets the train hover about 10 centimeters (4 inches) above the track. This allows the train to glide nearly friction-free and travel twice as fast as trains that roll on rails. \u00a0",
            "Magnetic levitation is not limited to magnetic metals, notes Eric Severson. He\u2019s a mechanical engineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Diamagnetic materials also can accomplish this feat. Around a strong magnet, these materials can become weakly magnetized and start to repel the magnet. This repulsive force, though feeble, can win a fight against gravity.",

The field created by the device was 16 teslas. That\u2019s about 10 times as strong as the magnets used to pick up cars in junkyards. And it was just enough to buoy the frog near the top of the inner coil of wire. That coil was 18 centimeters (7 inches) tall.",

            "The birds exhale each time they strike their beaks against tree bark. The sound is similar to a tennis player\u2019s grunt while hitting a ball. Woodpeckers match those exhales to their muscle movements. And that keeps them pecking at a surprisingly steady rate.",
            "The finding comes from a November 6 study in Journal of Experimental Biology.",
            "Woodpeckers are famous for hammering away at trees really fast and really hard. They strike wood hundreds of times per minute at forces 20 to 30 times their body weight. Until now, most research has focused on how woodpeckers do this without hurting their heads. The new research simply asked: How do woodpeckers do this at all?",

It involves \u201cthe movement of muscles across the body,\u201d he says. Antonson studies animal behavior at Brown University in Providence, R.I.",
            "He was part of a team that used a special kind of net to gently capture eight wild downy woodpeckers (Dryobates pubescens). They collected these birds from the Brown campus and surrounding area.",
            "To learn about the birds\u2019 movements, the scientists inserted electrodes into their muscles. Those devices picked up small electrical signals as the birds\u2019 muscles contracted, or shortened. Each bird wore a tiny backpack that recorded the electrode data. At the same time, a camera captured high-speed video of the birds\u2019 movements.",
            "The researchers watched the woodpeckers for a half hour at a time. They saw the birds drill, a behavior used to poke and dig. They also observed the birds tapping to communicate. After a few days, the scientists released the birds back into the wild.",
            "Woodpeckers drum too loud to hear anything but beaks on wood. But in this clip, the researchers turned data from the birds\u2019 respiratory system into sound. This allows us to \u201chear\u201d their breathing while pecking.",
            "A close look at the electrode and video data showed that woodpeckers\u2019 muscles and breathing work in harmony. This allows the birds\u2019 heads to move like hammers.",
            "When humans use a hammer, muscles in the back of their wrist stiffen. That cuts how much energy is lost when they hit something. The researchers saw a comparable stiffening in some of the woodpeckers\u2019 neck muscles. It\u2019s amazing, Antonson says, \u201cjust how similar it is to the way we hammer.\u201d",
            "Other muscles played special roles in the pecking motion. Before they struck, the birds seemed to steady themselves with their tail muscles. The power of the strike itself came from a single muscle in the hip.",
            "Distinct head and neck muscles helped pull back the head after each beat. These muscles activated before others completed their forward movement. The overlapping contractions may help smooth out the peckers\u2019 back-and-forth motions during a rapid drum solo.",
            "The team also looked at the woodpeckers\u2019 breathing to see if they exerted effort more like weightlifters or tennis players. Heavy weightlifters hold their breath when flexing. Tennis players, meanwhile, exhale through big movements.",
            "Downy woodpeckers, it turned out, take after tennis players. They can jab and exhale as many as 13 times per second. Between each blow, the birds take an inhale that lasts just 40 milliseconds. That\u2019s 10 times faster than some humans blink! The movement\u2019s timing stayed remarkably consistent over multiple taps, Antonson reports.",
            "Songbirds are known to take mini breaths while singing. Woodpeckers doing the same thing suggests their pecking, when done socially, might be more like singing than experts had thought, says Daniel Tobiansky. He wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. He studies bird brains and behavior at Providence College in Rhode Island.",
            "Nonvocal communication, such as pecking, often gets overlooked in animal research, Tobiansky says. Finding a similarity between bird drumming and singing might help scientists learn how these behaviors evolved."

That wall-like appearance is one thing that sets a haboob apart from other types of sandstorms. (A sandstorm is a broad term for windy storms that blow around sand and dust.)",
            "Haboobs are common in dry places, such as the U.S. Southwest and the Sahara. They move fast and can extend for kilometers (miles). Their wind speeds vary. But they can reach speeds of more than 95 kilometers (60 miles) per hour! These storms may last only a few minutes. Or they may persist for hours.",
            "Another thing that sets haboobs apart from other sandstorms is the way they form. Haboobs usually arise from thunderstorm downdrafts. A downdraft is when a thunderstorm quickly pushes air toward the ground in the area around the storm. This downward rush of air spreads out when it hits the ground, creating strong winds. In dry, dusty regions, those winds can pick up dust and sand. This creates a huge, moving cloud of sand and dust that can reach thousands of meters (feet) into the air.",
            "When a haboob sweeps through, it can kick up so much sand and dust that it\u2019s hard to see through the grit. That makes driving very dangerous. Drivers are advised to pull over and turn off their lights to avoid confusing others on the road in the poor visibility conditions. Winds can also blow sand into a person\u2019s mouth, making it hard to breathe. As a haboob approaches, the safest thing to do is get inside and close all windows and doors.",

There is a specific point where the two river channels meet.",

            "When stressed by heat, trees release chemicals. These can mix with molecules from car exhaust to make toxic air pollutants. And this can happen even where you can\u2019t smell any car exhaust. Atmospheric chemists at Texas A&M University in College Station shared their new findings here, on August 18, at the American Chemical Society fall meeting.",
            "People expect to find air pollution in and around cities. There, vehicles cough pollutants out of their tailpipes. But at Texas A&M, \u201cthe air smells beautiful,\u201d says Renyi Zhang. The campus is about 100 miles away from the closest big city. Here, he notes, the air is usually safe to breathe.",

            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

            "As the temps rose each day, so did levels of ozone, oxygenated volatile organic chemicals (some of which are toxic to human airways) and acid-rich nanoparticles. Ozone levels, in particular, climbed as the heat rose. Then they stayed high throughout the hottest part of the day. That in itself was no surprise. Trees ramp up isoprene release during heat waves. Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",
            "The surprise was just how high the ozone levels climbed. If you just looked at the levels of other pollutants, like the nitrogen oxides from cars, you might think the air was safe to breathe.",

Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible.

            "There are also ways to improve outdoor air quality. For instance, communities can work to limit becoming \u201cheat islands.\u201d Two obvious ways: Increase shaded area, and limit how much heat-absorbing concrete they have.",
            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change?

But in physics, the term energy means something quite specific and measurable. It simply means the ability to do work.",

            "At the time, Takebe\u2019s dad had to be hooked up to a ventilator. This involved snaking a tube down his throat so that a machine could push air into his lungs. \u201cI was really shocked by how invasive it is,\u201d says Takebe, who works at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center in Ohio. He also works at the University of Osaka in Japan.",
            "Takebe worried about how the ventilator might affect his dad. Doctors had already removed part of his dad\u2019s left lung due to a past infection. Takebe also was concerned about his father\u2019s lack of other options if the ventilator didn\u2019t get him enough oxygen. That got the scientist curious: Was there any way to get oxygen into the body without using the lungs?",
            "Inspiration struck when a student brought a book into Takebe\u2019s lab. The book described how some animals get oxygen through their skin or guts. Freshwater fish called loaches offer one example. They can swallow air and absorb oxygen through their intestines. It\u2019s a trick that helps them survive when their gills can\u2019t pull enough oxygen from the water.",
            "Takebe is an expert in the branch of medicine that deals with the digestive system. So he knew that the human intestinal tract is rich in blood vessels. That\u2019s why treatments called enemas \u2014 which send liquid up a patient\u2019s bottom \u2014 can get medicine into the bloodstream. And it made Takebe suspect that oxygen could pass from the intestines into the bloodstream, too.",
            "Takebe\u2019s team devised an enemalike treatment. It sends a liquid called perfluorodecalin (Per-floor-oh-DEK-uh-lin) up the rectum. This liquid can be loaded up with lots of oxygen. As it releases that oxygen into the body, space opens up within the liquid\u2019s chemical structure. The liquid can then absorb \u201cexhaled\u201d carbon dioxide.",

            "And even if people can get oxygen through the intestines, that wouldn\u2019t make it practical, Laffey adds. \u201cA liter of perfluorodecalin carries 500 milliliters of oxygen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe use 250 milliliters per minute. \u2026 It\u2019s just very hard to see how this would work.\u201d At the very least, sustained oxygen support would require a lot of enemas, over and over.",
            "Kevin Gibbs is more intrigued by the treatment. He\u2019s a critical-care lung doctor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.",

            "One example is when doctors need to put a tube down someone\u2019s throat to hook them up to a ventilator. The process takes mere minutes. Yet in that time, patients can suffer dangerously low oxygen levels, Gibbs points out. If sending oxygen up the anus works, it might sustain patients for the short time it takes to get them on life support. \u201cThat would be huge,\u201d he says.",
            "Takebe also imagines intestinal oxygen as an add-on to other types of breathing support. It could also be a short-term solution when other treatments aren\u2019t available. \u201cMaybe we can apply this in emergency situations,\u201d he says. For instance, when someone is on the way to the hospital. Or when they\u2019re being transferred from one hospital to another. But that future would still be many years and clinical trials away.",
            "In the meantime, how does Takebe\u2019s father feel about butt breathing as a way to help patients like him? \u201cDad is pleased,\u201d Takebe says. \u201cHe\u2019s always offering to be our experimental subject.\u201d That would of course be a conflict of interest, Takebe adds. But he appreciates his dad\u2019s support."
