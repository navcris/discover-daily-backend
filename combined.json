            "Bits of human bone recovered from Pompeii, Italy, have yielded DNA from people who died during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius \u2014 and the genetic data are challenging old assumptions about the victims\u2019 identities and relationships1.",
            "Researchers obtained the bone fragments from the plaster casts of people who died in the eruption, which buried the city under ash and pumice in ad 79. The DNA is the first to be recovered from the casts and reveals details about the sex, ancestry and family ties of five individuals.",

            "One narrative debunked by the genetic data, published today in Current Biology, centres on a victim long thought to be a mother who died while holding their child. An intricate golden bracelet on one of the their arms contributed to the attribution of female gender to the individual. The DNA analysis showed instead that the individual was a male and had no familial link with the child.",
            "The reversal shows that DNA can \u201crewrite history, or the stories of a particular group of individuals\u201d, says co-author David Caramelli, an anthropologist at the University of Florence in Italy.",

            "h2Moment of death",
            "Since excavations of the ruins of Pompeii began in the 1700s, more than 100 plaster casts of the victims\u2019 bodies have been made by pouring liquid plaster in the voids left by the destruction of their soft tissues. Many of these casts still encase pieces of the victims\u2019 bones.",
            "The researchers had the opportunity to collect some of these fragments during efforts to restore 86 of the 104 plaster casts. Samples from five individuals yielded complete or partial genomes. The researchers were very lucky, Lindo says. \u201cJust being exposed to that type of heat would have destroyed a lot of the DNA, and then being mixed environmentally with the plaster later on would have also complicated the situation.\u201d",

            "According to the DNA analysis, all five individuals were male. The analysis also revealed details of their relationships with each other. For example, the remains of the person wearing the golden bracelet and the child that the person carried were discovered along with two others. Until now, the people in the group were thought to belong to the same family, but the DNA analysis showed no biological connection between them. The findings highlight how unreliable such conventional interpretations, often based on limited evidence, can be, the authors say.",
            "Another interpretation challenged by the new data involves two individuals found in an apparent embrace. They were previously thought to be either sisters or a mother and a daughter, but the genetic analysis now suggests that at least one of them was male.",

            "\u201cWhat this study does is to remind us that there are indeed myths there to be debunked,\u201d says Steven Ellis, an archaeologist at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, who has led excavations in Pompeii. He notes that most narratives built around the plaster casts are simplified interpretations designed to boost public interest. Current scholarship about Pompeii doesn\u2019t necessarily accept past interpretations of the casts, but \u201cthe plaster casts are an extraordinary symbol of the tragedy that is the story of Pompeii and they\u2019ve always created a splash\u201d, he says. ",
            "The DNA analysis also confirmed that Pompeii\u2019s population was genetically diverse: the analysed individuals were descendants of immigrants from the eastern Mediterranean. \u201cWe\u2019ve known it from the jewelry that they\u2019re wearing, the cults that they follow, the decorations that adorn the houses,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t really know it from the body cast themselves.

He will also have to repair a faltering consensus around the Future Circular Collider (FCC), a new 90-kilometre tunnel to host the lab\u2019s flagship experiments throughout the rest of the century. The German government, CERN\u2019s largest contributor, expressed scepticism about the project earlier this year, and China could beat CERN to the punch with a similar project.",

He is currently chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a UK funding agency, and is a representative on the CERN Council, the board that oversees the laboratory on behalf of its member countries. He will take up the director general post at the end of 2025, when Gianotti\u2019s second consecutive five-year term is due to end. ",
            "In a press conference on 7 November, both Gianotti and Thomson stressed the need for continuity, and the importance of the ongoing \u20ac1.5 billion upgrade to the 27-kilometre LHC. Thomson also reiterated Gianotti\u2019s commitment to build the FCC. \u201cI am very much aligned with the vision of the current DG,\u201d he told reporters. ",

            "A first-of-its-kind blood test that uses biomarkers to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression could slash the time it takes to get an accurate diagnosis from years to weeks, according to the company that developed the test \u2014 but some scientists have raised concerns about its validity.",
            "The test uses biomarkers related to RNA editing to diagnose the condition and has been available in France since March and in Italy since October 2023, having been granted regulatory approval in both countries.",
            "Blood test uses \u2018protein clock\u2019 to predict risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases",
            "However, some researchers are concerned about the small size of the trials the test is based on and the lack of independent verification of the studies. The test\u2019s developer, the French start-up Alcediag in Montpellier, says that its trials are valid and reproducible. ",
            "The row highlights a wider discussion about the potential of biomarkers \u2014 biological characteristics that can indicate a particular medical state \u2014 to enable earlier diagnosis and more personalized treatments for psychiatric disorders.",
            "\u201cThere is a role for investigating biomarkers,\u201d says Suresh Sundram, a psychiatrist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cBut it is a very fraught area.\u201d",
            "h2Slow diagnosis",
            "Bipolar disorder, a spectrum of conditions characterized by mood swings that alternate between mania and depression, is difficult to diagnose. About 40 million people globally live with the illness, and the diagnostic process, which often involves multiple sessions with a psychiatrist, takes an average of seven to ten years, during which time people are often misdiagnosed with conditions such as depression and given inappropriate or ineffective treatments.",
            "Alcediag hopes to alter this grim landscape. The company says its \u20ac900 (US$980) blood test, EDIT-B, can help to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression using biomarkers. EDIT-B differentiates between the two by measuring subtle differences in RNA editing \u2014 a regulatory process that alters various cellular mechanisms, including the expression of genes, which in turn affects neurological functioning.",
            "Found: a brain-wiring pattern linked to depression",
            "Several studies have suggested that differences in RNA editing could play a part in autoimmune diseases and cancer, as well as in psychiatric conditions. In preliminary research, scientists at Alcediag identified distinct patterns of RNA editing affecting eight genes that seem to differ between healthy people and those experiencing depression. Among the depressed patients, six of these genes also show variations that distinguish people with depression from those with bipolar disorder. These differences produce a unique combination \u2014 or signature \u2014 of biomarkers that the company says it discovered using an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm it developed.",
            "\u201cWe have a signature for those with depression, a signature for the controls, and \u2026 one for bipolar,\u201d says Dinah Weissmann, co-founder and chief scientific officer of Alcediag. In a 2022 study involving 410 participants, the algorithm distinguished between the 160 people with depression and the 95 individuals with bipolar disorder with high accuracy1.",
            "About 80 people have used EDIT-B since its commercialization in France and Italy, says Weissmann, and feedback has been positive so far. She cites the anecdotal report of a person who, after receiving a positive test result, said they changed to more effective medication. \u201cThe patient wrote to their doctor: \u2018It\u2019s great, I\u2019m back on my feet. I\u2019m living normally again,\u2019\u201d says Weissmann.",
            "h2Potential risks",
            "For many people with bipolar disorder, a faster, more precise diagnosis would allow them to access \u201cthe right medication, at the right time\u201d, says Marion Leboyer, a psychiatrist and executive director of the FondaMental Foundation, a research organisation based near Paris.",
            "On the other hand, if a blood test gives an incorrect result, there is a risk that disorders could be misdiagnosed or overlooked, says Boris Chaumette, a psychiatrist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris. ",
            "There is no indication that an EDIT-B result has led to an incorrect diagnosis. But Chaumette and others are concerned about some of the methodology of studies used to demonstrate the EDIT-B test\u2019s effectiveness. He points to \u201cinherent limits\u201d to the 2022 study with 410 participants. \u201cYou take a data set with many variables and not many patients, and you ask an algorithm to classify people. It will inevitably find things that classify them, it will inevitably identify commonalities,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, what you observe could be the effect of treatments.\u201d",
            "Simple blood test detects eight different kinds of cancer",
            "He adds that, apart from the control group, every person involved in Alcediag\u2019s studies was taking medication (as is often the case with psychiatric research). These drugs could affect the levels of some biomarkers, says Sundram, \u201cso the algorithm could pick up the effect of the medicine\u201d.",
            "Weissmann says that the study participants with bipolar disorder and those with depression were taking a range of different medications, so if the algorithm was distinguishing people on the basis of their treatments, it would have classified them according to therapeutic classes. Stable patients \u2014 those who had a diagnosis but were not experiencing symptoms at the time of the study \u2014 also had a different biomarker signature from the control group, she adds, indicating that their medication suppressed symptoms without affecting markers of the underlying illness. She says that Alcediag\u2019s studies have involved hundreds of participants, and that the company is conducting a new clinical trial with 436 patients; they expect to publish the results next year.",
            "h2Replication questions",
            "Certain aspects of Alcediag\u2019s studies make it difficult for independent researchers to verify the work, says Chaumette. The algorithm and its underlying code haven\u2019t been shared, and follow-up studies run after the initial 2022 trial have used slightly different versions of the test. In a study the firm published this year, for example, it had removed one biomarker from the initial combination and added three new ones2.",
            "This issue led the French National Authority for Health (HAS), an independent body that assesses health products, to reject Alcediag\u2019s application for people taking the test to be reimbursed by the French health authorities. \u201cThere were variations in performance among the three versions, and we lacked the rationale to explain why this version was chosen and not another,\u201d says C\u00e9dric Carbonneil, who heads the HAS department responsible for assessing new medical devices and procedures. It is not unusual for companies at early stages of development to initially have their applications denied, and the HAS expects Alcediag to reapply, he adds. Alcediag says that it made changes to the biomarkers to improve the test\u2019s performance, and that it hasn\u2019t shared the algorithm for commercial reasons.",
            "Chaumette says he would have liked to see larger studies backing up the test before it was rolled out to patients, and he hopes Alcediag will make its technology available to independent groups to allow them to replicate the findings. \u201cIf you commercialize it rapidly and patent everything without sharing anything, then it becomes opaque.\u201d",

            "Pain-sensing nerves and immune cells work together to wreak havoc in endometriosis, a painful condition that affects an estimated 190 million women and girls of reproductive age. But a study in mice suggests a way to harness that interaction to treat the disorder1.",
            "The research, which was published on 6 November in Science Translational Medicine, reveals a key molecular pathway that not only promotes the sensation of pain caused by endometriosis, but also exacerbates the disease. Drugs that inhibit this pathway are already used for the treatment of migraines \u2014 the study\u2019s findings suggest that these therapies might be useful to treat endometriosis as well.",
            "\u201cThis is a new way of looking at how we could change pain pathways in endometriosis,\u201d says Louise Hull, a researcher who studies endometriosis and treats people with the condition at the University of Adelaide in Australia.",
            "h2Limited treatments",
            "Endometriosis occurs when cells similar to the lining of the uterus grow outside of the organ, sometimes causing pain, infertility and heavy menstrual bleeding. Current treatment options are limited. Hormonal medications can reduce symptoms in some people but not everyone can tolerate the side effects, and they are not useful for those who want to become pregnant. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used to relieve pain, but long-term use can damage the liver and kidneys. And the benefits of surgical treatments to remove endometrial deposits are often transient.",
            "The condition is also famously understudied, says Michael Rogers, a cancer researcher at the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts and an author on the study. \u201cCompared to other diseases that are similarly widespread and have a similar economic impact, endometriosis research is at least two \u2014 and probably three \u2014 orders of magnitude underfunded,\u201d he says.",
            "Rogers was recruited to the field by a member of his church whose family has been severely affected by endometriosis. Every month or two, she petitioned him: \u201cShe would say, \u2018Mike, you really need to start working on this disease.\u2019\u201d",
            "Eventually, she won him over. Rogers started following research in the field and, about nine years ago, began to develop the animal models he needed to investigate the condition.",
            "By then, researchers had already discovered that immune cells called macrophages probably contribute to endometriosis and that pain-sensing nerves are also involved2. Rogers and his colleagues found that disabling these nerves in mice with a condition similar to endometriosis not only dampened pain, as assessed by the animals\u2019 behaviour, but also reduced the size of lesions containing endometrial cells. \u201cThis strongly suggested that the pain-sensing nerves weren\u2019t just sensing pain, they were doing something to help the lesions grow,\u201d says study co-author Victor Fattori, a pharmacologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.",
            "h2Crosstalk",
            "The team decided to test whether a protein called CGRP, which aids communication between the nervous system and macrophages, might also have a role in endometriosis. Several drugs that block CGRP have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for other conditions, and the researchers administered four of these to mice with an endometriosis-like condition.",
            "Again, they saw a decrease in pain. Two of the drugs significantly reduced lesion size, and it\u2019s possible that higher doses of the other two medicines would have done so as well, says Rogers. ",
            "Clinical trials are needed to determine whether the same approach could be effective in people. Rogers is optimistic that such trials could begin soon: the drugs are already on the market and are considered relatively safe.",
            "Even so, it will be particularly important to demonstrate that they are safe for women who might want to become pregnant while taking the drug, says Hull.",
            "If shown to be safe and effective, CGRP-inhibiting drugs could fill a gap in care for people with endometriosis, says Erin Greaves, who studies the condition at the University of Warwick, UK, and who collaborates with Rogers. \u201cNew non-hormonal treatments for endometriosis are desperately needed.\u201d",

The hope is that the data will aid researchers trying to crack the causes of age-related diseases, particularly conditions that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
            "\u201cTo address challenges in human medicine, we need to draw from a wide range of model systems,\u201d says Christine Charvet, a comparative neuroscientist at Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine in Alabama, who presented the work. \u201cCats, lemurs, mice are all useful. We shouldn\u2019t focus all our efforts on one.\u201d",

            "The Translating Time project started in the 1990s as a tool for developmental biologists1. Project scientists compiled data on how long it takes for the brain to reach a range of developmental milestones in a variety of mammals and used these data to graph the relative development of two species over time. This can help researchers to link observations of animal development to the corresponding human age.",
            "Ageing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline",
            "Over the years, however, as Charvet presented these data at conferences, researchers kept asking her to extend the database to include not only early development, but also how the brain changes as animals age.",
            "Scientists have long been frustrated with the limitations of standard laboratory models when it comes to understanding human ageing and its impact on the unique human brain. Mice live for only a few years \u2014 not long enough to accumulate much of the damage thought to drive some neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Mice might also possess mechanisms that humans lack for clearing clumps of misfolded proteins called plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, says Melissa Edler, a comparative neurobiologist at Kent State University in Ohio.",
            "The evolutionary mismatch between mice and men could be one reason why efforts to develop therapies to treat the disease have often fallen flat, says Elaine Guevara, who studies primate evolutionary genetics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cMice don\u2019t develop the classic hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir brains are quite different to ours.\u201d",

The Dog Aging Project, run by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and Texas A&M University in College Station, tracks tens of thousands of companion dogs to learn more about how their genetics, lifestyle and environment affect ageing.",
            "Does the human lifespan have a limit?",
            "But centuries of breeding have influenced ageing and disease in dogs, says Charvet. Cats often live a bit longer than dogs, she says, and are generally not as highly inbred for specific traits \u2014 some of which also raise disease risk.",
            "So Charvet and her colleagues have been gathering data from veterinary clinics and zoos, and launched an effort called the Catage Project that asks cat owners to submit data about their pets.",
            "So far, they have collected health records and results of blood sample analyses from thousands of felines and taken brain scans of more than 50. Using their own data and the published literature, the team is filling in events along the nonlinear relationship between cat and human ages. A one-year-old cat, for example, is roughly equivalent to an 18-year-old human. But in the next year, a cat ages only about 4 \u2018human years\u2019, to become about as mature as a 22-year-old person.",
            "By the age of 15, a cat is an octogenarian in human years. Some cats experience cognitive decline by then, and the brain scans collected by the team reveal brain volume changes in older cats that mirror those seen in older humans, says Charvet. Previous work has also shown that cats can accumulate plaques and tangles of abnormal proteins similar to those that characterize Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans.",
            "h2Multiple models",
            "Ultimately, researchers might develop a variety of model systems for different aspects of ageing and neurodegeneration, says Edler. Although mice are poor models for some aspects of human ageing, they will still be valuable, because it is so easy for researchers to conduct genetic experiments with the rodents, she says.",
            "Other animals, such as cats or certain nonhuman primates, might be better models for other aspects of brain ageing.

            "This instinctive reflex is shared by many furry mammals including mice, cats, squirrels, lions, tigers and bears. The move helps animals to remove water, insects or other irritants from hard-to-reach places. But underlying the shakes is a complex \u2014 and previously mysterious \u2014 neurological mechanism.",
            "Now, researchers have identified the neural circuit that triggers characteristic \u2018wet dog\u2019 shaking behaviour in mice \u2014 which involves a specific class of touch receptors, and neurons that connect the spinal cord to the brain. Their findings were published in Science on 7 November1.",

But in mice and other animals, they serve a protective role: alerting them to the presence of something on their skin, whether it\u2019s water, dirt or a parasite. When these stimuli cause hairs on the skin to bend it activates the C-LTMRs, says Marshall, \u201cextending the sensibility of the skin beyond just the surface\u201d.",
            "To get laboratory mice to shake their fur like wet dogs, the researchers applied drops of sunflower oil to the backs of the mice\u2019s necks. Nearly all the animals shook off these drops within ten seconds. The team then genetically modified some of the mice to remove most of their C-LTMRs. These animals showed a 50% reduction in shakes when oil droplets landed on their neck, compared with unmodified control mice.",
            "The researchers also wanted to explore how signals from C-LTMRs travel through the nervous system to orchestrate the wet dog shakes. They traced the pathway to a group of neurons in the spinal cord; this connects to an area in the brain called the parabrachial nucleus, which is involved in processing pain, temperature and touch.",
            "Using optogenetics, a technique that engineers neurons so that they can be switched on and off in response to light, the researchers blocked the activity of the spinal neurons. These mice showed a 58% reduction in shakes compared with control mice. Blocking activity in the parabrachial nucleus produced similar results. The mice still scratched, groomed and moved normally, suggesting that the neural circuit is specific to wet dog shakes.",

It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neurological condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease.",
            "When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious molecule operates. \u201cThere was so much confusion in the field,\u201d Laflamme says.",
            "He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were advertised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them through their paces, only three performed well \u2014 meaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didn\u2019t even bind the key protein in Laflamme\u2019s testing. And those papers had been collectively cited more than 3,000 times1.",

Scientists have long known that many commercial antibodies don\u2019t work as they should \u2014 they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a \u2018reproducibility crisis\u2019 in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development.",

He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced \u2018Icarus\u2019), an initiative that aims to characterize commercially available research antibodies for every human protein.",
            "There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best practices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physician\u2013scientist at the University of Leicester, UK. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d",

            "The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify specific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity \u2014 a strong affinity for the target \u2014 and selectivity \u2014 the ability to leave other proteins unmarked.",
            "For decades, scientists created these antibodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer-term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from animals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells. When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350 antibody suppliers around the world.",
            "In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies.",
            "What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from companies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collaborating. YCharOS\u2019s industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initiative (which include various non-profit organizations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published.",

            "Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 antibodies that are meant to bind to more than 100 human proteins.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work ahead,\u201d Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names).",

The context in which antibodies are used can change how they perform.",
            "Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping consortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are collections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging \u2014 a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs.",

            "Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by vendors to label specific products) \u2014 making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, it\u2019s important to have the right reagents \u2014 and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says.",
            "After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a company discontinues a product \u2014 and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this.",
            "\u2018A landmark moment\u2019: scientists use AI to design antibodies from scratch",
            "In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000 journals have adopted policies that request these identifiers. \u201cWe currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers,\u201d says Bandrowski.",
            "Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. \u201cThat won\u2019t change reproducibility by itself, but it is the first step.\u201d",
            "In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies \u2014 and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOS\u2019s characterization data onto its site.",
            "\u201cThe big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many different species that you can\u2019t tick off that an antibody is good or bad,\u201d Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d Chalmers says.",
            "h2Stakeholders get involved",
            "Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.",
            "When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didn\u2019t detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. \u201cThat was a shock,\u201d Virk says. \u201cAt that point, I wanted to leave science \u2014 because if things are really this unreliable, what\u2019s the point?\u201d",
            "Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders \u2014 such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers \u2014 to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first workshop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies. They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.",
            "Blame it on the antibodies",
            "Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester \u2014 the first outside Canada \u2014 which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.",
            "Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also altering the way some of their products are made.",
            "The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies generated by immune cells or immune\u2013cancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies4. Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells programmed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch \u2014 a key problem with the older methods.",
            "A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. \u201cFacilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improving reproducibility,\u201d says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. \u201cThat\u2019s something that antibody suppliers should be doing.\u201d",
            "Rob Meijers, director of the antibody platform at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant antibodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. \u201cThey\u2019re much more reproducible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive,\u201d he says.",

            "Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists\u2019 behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers don\u2019t want to hear that an antibody they\u2019ve been using for their experiments isn\u2019t actually doing what it\u2019s meant to, Williams says. \u201cIf somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, it\u2019s being used regardless, even if it\u2019s certain that it doesn\u2019t bind this protein,\u201d Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, \u201cyou can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations\u201d.",

But the idea of right- versus left-brain skills also caught people\u2019s imaginations. An article based on Sperry\u2019s work had been published in the New York Times Magazine in 1973. It took ideas from his findings and other case studies and ran with them. It claimed skills such as musical ability were controlled entirely by the right brain.",
            "In this way, important research gave way to speculation.",
            "In fact, this early research had one huge limitation: Scientists back then had no way to look inside a living brain.",
            "Now, researchers have several tools that can image the working brain. One is functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. It can track blood flow in the brain. Active brain cells need lots of oxygen, which is carried by blood. So high levels of blood flow are used to pinpoint regions where the brain is active.",
            "In 2013, researchers used MRI to scan the brains of more than 1,000 kids and young adults. They measured whether some brain functions seemed isolated to the left or right sides. And a few functions were tied more strongly to one side, these scans showed. Among them was language, which supported Sperry\u2019s findings from decades earlier. But most brain networks bounced between both hemispheres.",

[Activity] is very, very distributed.\u201d And, she adds,\u00a0\u201cThank goodness it is, because both sides of the brain have a lot to offer.\u201d Though not part of the MRI work, Sarko studies the brain at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.",

            "And then there are the newfound flickering gamma-ray flashes. These outbursts fall between the two other types of gamma-ray emissions in both brightness and duration. Like high-energy strobe lights, gamma-ray flickers consist of short pulses that repeat over tens to hundreds of milliseconds. \u00d8stgaard and the other researchers described these on October 3 in yet another Nature paper.",
            "Those flickers could help solve a couple key mysteries about thunderstorms. One is: How are their different types of gamma-ray outbursts related?",
            "Storms are known to produce gamma rays when electrons get accelerated in\u00a0strong electric fields\u00a0that build up inside clouds. These electrons produce more electrons, and so on. When electrons in this avalanche smash into air molecules, they throw off gamma rays. But it\u2019s still unknown what makes a cloud emit a terrestrial gamma-ray flash, versus a gamma-ray glow.",
            "Discovering a middle ground between those two extremes \u2014 those flickering gamma-ray flashes \u2014 could help answer that question.",
            "The flickering ones may help explain how lightning forms, too. Many of the flickering gamma-ray flashes seen by ER-2 were followed by lightning. This could mean that the flickering gamma-ray flashes help kickstart those bolts.\u00a0",

            "Craters are round, bowl-shaped depressions surrounded by a ring, like the one shown in Figure 1. They are made when a\u00a0meteorite\u00a0collides with a\u00a0planet\u00a0or a\u00a0moon. Craters are what make our moon look like Swiss cheese. Each round hole is the place where a meteorite\u00a0impacted, or hit, the surface of the moon, so craters are often called\u00a0impact craters. Often, the meteorite that creates a crater explodes on impact, so the crater is an empty reminder of the collision.",
            "There are\u00a0meteoroids\u00a0traveling around throughout space, and all of the moons and planets in our solar system have been impacted by meteorites since its formation. (Note: they are called meteoroids when they\u2019re still in space, and meteorites when they land on a planet or moon.)",
            "On Earth, we only see a few impact craters, for a couple of different reasons. First, most meteoroids never reach the Earth\u2019s surface because they burn up in the atmosphere. This is what we are seeing when we watch a\u00a0shooting star\u00a0during a\u00a0meteor shower\u00a0(meteor\u00a0refers to the visible streak of light). Second, impact craters from meteorites can be changed by geological forces (like earthquakes and continental movements) or eroded away by atmospheric forces (like wind or rain). There is no atmosphere on the moon, which means that falling meteoroids do not burn up and there is no weather to erode away the craters. In fact, the footprints of the astronauts who landed on the moon over 50 years ago are still there!",

            "Where can you find impact craters on Earth? There are only about 170 confirmed impact craters on Earth. Not all of them are obvious because most are eroded, covered by sediment or under water. Each crater has to be identified using several different kinds of clues. First, geological clues are found by looking for pieces of the exploded, iron-rich meteorite or for glass that formed during the impact. Satellite imaging can be used to visualize crater formations that are beneath the Earth\u2019s surface or a body of water. Finally, chemical evidence is used to date the crater and find traces of elements that are more common in space than on our planet.",
            "By piecing together this evidence, scientists can study craters on Earth and link them to different periods of Earth\u2019s history. This involves many different types of scientists, including astronomers, geologists, chemists, paleontologists and meteorologists (who actually study weather, not meteorites). This has led to an interesting hypothesis being proposed about the formation of a sea, the extinction of the dinosaurs and even the origins of life!",

            "A full moon could make it easy for a werewolf to spot prey. But a bright night makes it easy to be spotted, too. ",
            "As the full moon rises, a mythical werewolf howls and heads out on the hunt. But is this the best time for werewolves to find a meal? In some stories, this transformation can happen at any time of the month or even during the day. And science suggests that a careful werewolf might want to schedule their change based on their goals.\u00a0",
            "The moon affects our world in several ways. As it orbits Earth, the moon pushes and pulls at the oceans to make tides. These tides can, in turn, influence the behavior of ocean creatures. And moonlight \u2014 a reflection of the sun \u2014 can also have power over the behavior of animals both on land and in the sea.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "If a werewolf is all big, scary predator, the full moon might be a blessing. But if the animal could face predators itself, it might want to save its transformation for a much darker night.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The dark depths of an ocean or stream might not seem like the obvious place for animals affected by the moon. But \u201cit is something that we see pretty commonly among aquatic critters,\u201d says Heidi Ballew. She\u2019s a marine ecologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ballew studies the \u2018O\u2018opu nakea (Awaous stamineus), a goby native to Hawaii. The hardy little fish are born in freshwater streams in the hills. From there, a goby\u2019s life can take two very different paths depending on when it\u2019s born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When the moon is full, the sun, Earth and moon are lined up. This produces higher tides. Some gobies hatch during that full moon. The higher tides sweep their tiny bodies out to sea. When they are grown, higher tides during the new moon (when the sun, moon and Earth line up again) help them find their way back to their home streams. Special fins on their bellies, modified into suckers, help them climb waterfalls back to their birthplace. There, they mate and make more gobies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/mmwM7dwtvKA?feature=oembed",
            "Waterfall? Not a problem. Watch a goby climb up a waterfall with her mouth and her sucker-like fin.\u00a0",
            "But not all gobies go out to see the world. Gobies born during the dark of a new moon stay home and never leave the stream where they are born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Baby gobies are trying to avoid predation, Ballew says. \u201cA full moon provides a high tide. But it also produces a lot of light \u2014 even underwater.\u201d Night-hunting fish can better see tiny, defenseless gobies. So if a fish is going to stay put, hatching at the new moon is a safer bet.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The moon matters even as they grow into adults. A big, well-fed baby goby may become an adult during the full moon. But a smaller goby might become an adult at the new moon instead. The darkness hides these still-small, newly adult gobies, keeping them safe from predators. Ballew and her colleagues published their fishy findings February 26 in the journal Ecology of Freshwater Fish.\u00a0",
            "So there are pros and cons to lots of moonlight. A full moon lights up the night and makes it easy to spot dinner. But if a werewolf is as likely to become prey as it is to go hunting, a new moon might help it hide.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The bright night of a full moon also presents Australian mammals with a problem, says Euan Ritchie. He\u2019s a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In one study, Ritchie and his colleagues took photos of animals in southeastern Australia at different phases of the moon. Prey species such as possums and rabbit-sized bandicoots were more active when nights were cloudy. The extra darkness provided cover to hide from predators.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But predators such as quolls were also more active when it was darker \u2014 when the moon was new or half. Each species was trying to find a balance between getting more food and becoming someone else\u2019s dinner.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "\u201cPredators often use ambush to capture their prey,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cThe lighter it is, the harder it might be [for predators] to avoid detection.\u201d While the prey might be able to spot a predator more easily, they, too, may be more detectable. \u201cThey [might] be more hesitant to be active, especially in areas without much cover to retreat to.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ritchie and his colleagues published their findings in 2020 in the journal Australian Mammalogy.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Werewolves also need to find that balance between predator and prey. If a werewolf wanted to hunt as much as possible, \u201cthey would hunt humans by day and night,\u201d Ritchie says. But being a werewolf isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cMany prey, including humans, are often far from harmless.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In that case, Ballew says, a werewolf might be advised to vary its strategy. A big, strong werewolf could find good hunting during the full moon. But if a werewolf is small, young, or weak? \u201cMaybe you would want to utilize the new moon so that your predators are less likely to find you.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson a werewolf could learn from the gobies that stayed home.\u00a0\u00a0"

But since Percy\u00a0landed in Jezero Crater three years ago, scientists have struggled to identify organics, Stack Morgan says. That landing site was an ancient, dried-up lake.",
            "Adding to the new excitement, little white spots with black rims speckle the reddish rock sample that Percy found. \u201cThey look like a tricolored leopard spot,\u201d Stack Morgan says.",
            "Percy examined these spots using instruments that can identify the chemical recipe of materials. And the spots\u2019 rims contained iron phosphate. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry have been linked to ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create such rings can be an energy source for microbes.",

And that\u2019s an important point. \u201cBut based on our experience with similar things on Earth,\u201d she says, \u201cthere is a possibility that life could have been involved.\u201d So, Stack Morgan concludes, \u201cthese could have a biological origin.\u201d",

And those veins are filled with super-tiny crystals of olivine. It\u2019s a mineral that forms from a volcano\u2019s magma.",
            "Finding the spots and these volcanic features in the same rock is \u201ca little bit mysterious,\u201d Stack Morgan says. They seem to point to different origins, she says.

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years.

These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

Dom, who prefers to use only his first name, had been fast asleep. Just 15 at the time, he panicked and closed his eyes. \u201cI only saw it for a second,\u201d he recalls. Now, he\u2019s a young adult who lives in the United Kingdom. But he still remembers the experience vividly.",
            "Was the figure a ghost? In the mythology of the United States and many other Western cultures, a ghost or spirit is a dead person who interacts with the living world. In stories, a ghost may whisper or groan, cause things to move or fall, mess with electronics \u2014 even appear as a shadowy, blurry or see-through figure.",

One night, a big thud prompted her to grab her camera. This was the first picture she took. Other photos she took on that and later nights showed nothing unusual. Does this story make it seem like ghosts exist? Or is the glowing figure a flash of light that the camera accidentally captured?",
            "Ghost stories are lots of fun, especially on Halloween. But some people believe that ghosts are real. Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",
            "On ghost-hunting TV shows, people use scientific equipment to attempt to record or measure spirit activity. And numerous creepy photos and videos make it seem like ghosts exist. However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",
            "Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager.",
            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",
            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",

            "Partway through the video, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the players. Did you see it? About half of all viewers who count passes while watching the video miss the gorilla completely.",
            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Every two years, on the first Tuesday (after a Monday) in November, Americans should head to the polls to take part in a national election. Some important elections may take part in the off-years as well. But not everyone who is eligible to vote will do so. In fact, millions of people won\u2019t. And that\u2019s a problem because people who don\u2019t vote lose out on a prime chance to register their views. Also, voting isn\u2019t just important. It is a privilege and a right that many people throughout the world lack.",
            "One person\u2019s vote probably won\u2019t change course of an election. But a few thousand votes \u2014 or even a few hundred \u2014 certainly can. Consider, for instance, the famous election between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000. Once the polling was over, Florida had to recount its votes. In the end, Bush won by 537 votes. That difference decided who became president of the United States.",
            "Even in polling for local offices \u2014 such as a school board \u2014 the result of a vote can change everything from what schools neighborhood children will attend to whether their textbooks will cover evolution.",
            "There are many reasons why people don\u2019t vote.\u00a0And to counter the anger, apathy, fatigue and other factors that deter many folks from voting, organizations big and small mount campaigns urging people to go to the polls. Facebook users may plead with their friends. Politicians may hire phone banks to call thousands of people in states where a race appears to be very competitive. Celebrities may beg over YouTube. Does any of this really work?",
            "Political scientists have studied ways to change people\u2019s voting behavior. These four methods seem to stand out in terms of being most effective.",
            "1) Educate early and well\u00a0\u00a0 Messages that people receive early in life have a strong impact on whether people vote, notes Donald Green. He\u2019s a political scientist at Columbia University in New York City. Parents and teachers should therefore let kids know \u201cvoting is important,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes you a functioning adult.\u201d Teachers might help deliver this message in classes where students learn about how their country and government functions. That happened to me in high school when my own teacher one day begged me and my classmates to vote.",
            "People with college degrees are also more likely to vote. Perhaps society should make it easier for people to afford college. \u201cA person who gets a college education ends up in a different life circumstance,\u201d explains Barry Burden. He\u2019s a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. College graduates tend to associate more with people who vote \u2014 and then they vote, too. They also stand to earn more (paying more taxes), data have shown. So a more educated population should be a win-win for society.",
            "2) Peer pressure\u00a0 \u00a0A healthy dose of name and shame can have a big effect on Election Day. Green and his colleagues demonstrated this in a study published in 2008 in American Political Science Review. They applied a little social pressure to voters.",
            "Right before Michigan\u2019s 2006 Republican primary, the researchers selected a group of 180,000 potential voters. They mailed about 20,000 voters a letter asking them to do their \u201ccivic duty\u201d and vote. They mailed another 20,000 a different letter. It asked them to do their civic duty, but added that they were being studied \u2014 and that their votes were a matter of public record. (In some states, such as Michigan, voting records are publicly available after an election.) A third group got the same messages as the second group. But they also got a note that showed them their previous voting record, and the previous voting records of the people in their household. A fourth group got the same information as the third group, as well as being shown the publicly available voting records of their neighbors. The last 99,000 people or so were a control \u2014 they got no mailings at all.",
            "*350_inline_Voting2pngpng",
            "fCWhen many Americans vote on November 8, they will go into small, curtained stalls to keep their choices private.",
            "After all the votes were counted, the scientists saw a 1.8 percentage point increase in turnout by people who had been reminded to vote over those who did not get such a mailing. For the group told their votes were a matter of public record, there was a 2.5 percentage point increase. But the biggest increase were among those shown voting records. Turnout increased by 4.9 percentage points among people shown their previous voting records. And if voters were also shown their neighbors voting records, turnout at the polls rose a whopping 8.1 percentage points.",
            "Although shaming may get out the vote, Green cautions that it likely also burns bridges. \u201cI think it produces backlash,\u201d he says. In the 2008 study, many of the people who received the letter that showed the voting records of their neighbors called the number on the mailing and asked to be left alone.",
            "Peer pressure doesn\u2019t always have to be mean, though. Asking friends directly to pledge to vote \u2014 and then making sure they do \u2014 might be effective, Green says. The most effective thing to do, he says, may be to say to a close friend or coworker, \u201clet\u2019s walk to the polls together.\u201d",
            "3) Healthy competition\u00a0 \u201cPeople are going to participate when they think they are going to make a difference,\u201d says Eyal Winter. An economist, he works at the University of Leicester in England and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He notes that there is higher voter turnout when an election is close and there\u2019s no telling who might win. Winter compares elections to football or baseball games. When two close rivals face off, their competitions will draw much bigger crowds than when one team is sure to roll right over another. \u00a0",
            "To find out whether a close election might make more people vote than a race where one politician is far behind another, Winter and his colleague looked at U.S. elections for state governors from 1990 to 2005. When surveys before the election showed that results were likely to be very close, voter turnout increased. Why? People now felt their vote might make a bigger difference.",
            "More voters also turned out for the side with the slight majority in the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer to support your team when you\u2019re expected to win,\u201d Winter explains. He and his colleague Esteban Klor \u2014 a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem \u2014 published their findings in 2006 on the Social Science Research Network.",
            "4) The personal touch\u00a0\u00a0 Hundreds of studies have been done on what gets people to vote. Some of the studies might be partisan \u2014 focusing on people who support a particular party. Others might focus on both major parties or even on people in general. Such research has probed everything from the how much money to spend on voicemail messages to crafting the ideal subject line for an email.",
            "Many of these ideas are described in Get out the Vote: How to increase voter turnout. This book was written by Green and his colleague Alan Gerber of Yale University in New Haven, Conn. The 2015 version of the book includes chapters on social media, mailing letters to people\u2019s houses and putting signs along highways. Letters and signs, computerized phone calls and Facebook posts all seem to help a little. But the most effective methods employ face-to-face and one-on-one discussions of the candidates, Green says. For politicians this means walking door to door (or having volunteers do it).",
            "But maybe someone just wants to get a sister or friend to vote. In that case, Green says the most effective message might be to convey your own enthusiasm for the candidates, the issues and how much you\u2019d like to see that person vote.",
            "Appealing directly to friends and family might help them get to the polls on Election Day. But keep in mind that everyone has their own opinions on the candidates. Even if you get your friends and family members to vote, they might not vote the way you\u2019d like them to."

            "Waviness in the high-speed flow of the jet stream (shown) can cause fingers of stratospheric air to punch down and curl into the troposphere below. This mixing of atmospheric layers spurs chemical reactions that cause new aerosol particles to form.",
            "Clouds form when water molecules in the air stick to certain tiny particles \u2014 think of them as seeds. Scientists have now discovered an unexpected source of those seeds.",
            "When two layers of Earth\u2019s atmosphere overlap, chemicals in each layer can mix and react. These reactions can form the tiny new particles around which clouds begin to form. In fact, this may be the most common way that the seeds for clouds form. That\u2019s the finding of a study in the July 12 Science.",
            "Earth\u2019s atmosphere has five layers. We live in the troposphere. It\u2019s the lowest one. It also has the densest air. The stratosphere, right above it, has thinner air. It also contains different chemicals than those in our layer.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists had thought most new atmospheric particles form in the upper troposphere. Clouds would rise into this region and then shed rain. That rain would carry away the existing particles. Gases left behind would have almost no solid particles left to glom onto. So new clouds would not develop until new particles formed.",
            "In the new study, researchers looked at data collected during a series of flights by NASA aircraft. Many particles are formed when the stratosphere dips a toe into the upper troposphere, they found. They call this stratospheric air intrusion. It\u2019s caused by the jet stream, a fast-moving current of air.",
            "And it just might be the most productive place on Earth for cloud-forming particles, the new data suggest.",
            "The stratosphere is cold and enriched with a type of oxygen known as ozone. The troposphere is warmer. It\u2019s moister and contains a variety of other gases. Sunlight and water cause molecules in these air masses to react chemically. This can generate different types of tiny particles, explains study coauthor Jian Wang. He\u2019s an aerosol scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",

These gas molecules eagerly react with other gases high above Earth. So there are probably many different chemical reactions going on up there. And they\u2019ll produce a variety of new gases and particles. Exactly which and how many particles are being formed is a question for future research, Wang says.",

            "Waviness of the jet stream can lead the stratosphere \u2014 rich in ozone (O3) \u2014 to dip into the troposphere, which is rich in water (H2O). The troposphere also contains molecules such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), emitted by fossil fuels and volcanoes. Sunlight and water vapor cause these chemicals to react in ways that generate chemicals such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a building block of tiny aerosol particles. Previous research had suggested that the main way new particles formed were instead \u201ccloud outflows\u201d \u2014 regions where high troposphere clouds break up.",
            "Stratospheric intrusions may be an especially big source of such new particles in Earth\u2019s midlatitudes. Those are regions such as the continental United States \u2014 ones that are not close to either the poles or the Equator.",
            "Climate change is expected to speed up stratospheric circulation. In the future, that could cause the stratosphere to poke into the troposphere more frequently. If it does, stratospheric intrusion may become even more important in forming new particles, Wang says.",
            "This newly reported role for jet streams in particle formation has been long overlooked, says Yuanlong Huang. He did not take part in the new study. An atmospheric aerosol chemist, Huang works at the Eastern Institute for Advanced Study. It\u2019s in Ningbo, China.",
            "Right now, he notes, stratospheric intrusion is not yet accounted for in computer models that simulate weather and climate. In other words, these particles may play a bigger role than scientists once thought in how incoming sunlight is distributed on Earth. That includes how much of the sun\u2019s rays reach the planet\u2019s surface. It also includes how much of the sun\u2019s energy aerosols and clouds absorb high in the atmosphere."

He\u2019s a chemical biologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He\u2019s also a founder of Algenesis Materials. It\u2019s a company developing a new plastic.",
            "Most plastics have been made from crude oil, a fossil fuel. Four years ago, Burkart\u2019s team at UCSD developed a new type. They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",
            "The researchers described the finding March 12 in Scientific Reports.",
            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",
            "Compost has everything the plastic needs to degrade: microbes to break it down plus water. The material also can break down in wet soil or the ocean.",
            "But the new plastic won\u2019t break down while you\u2019re using it, says Stephen Mayfield. He\u2019s a molecular geneticist at UCSD. He\u2019s also the chief executive officer of Algenesis Materials. To break down the microplastics, \u201cyou need them to be wet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you break that cycle, even for a short period of time, you kill the microorganisms.\u201d",

            "When microbes break down plant materials, such as cellulose, they release carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. The researchers decided to compare the CO2 output of microbes dining on the new microplastic to when they ate cellulose.",
            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",
            "The scientists also coated a piece of fabric in the new plastic. After being mixed with the compost for two weeks, that fabric easily broke apart. Another piece of the coated fabric was not composted. It was still intact after two weeks.",

            "Polyurethane is sometimes used to coat natural fibers, like wool and cotton, for clothing, Erdle says. Over time, that plastic coating flakes off, \u201cfragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces and never going away.\u201d Having something that can readily be broken down by bacteria, she says, is better than \u201chaving persistent plastic in the environment.\u201d",

            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

But if we\u2019re not so quick to \u201cick,\u201d the protein from these insects has a lot to offer, say some researchers. That\u2019s what\u2019s behind new work to see how insect protein might be used to fortify many types of foods.",
            "Edible insects are a healthy and sustainable source of animal protein. That\u2019s why food scientists have been working to extract it \u2014 then turn it into a powder. That means diners don\u2019t have to bite into any heads, legs or wormy bodies. But some extraction methods can degrade certain health benefits of that protein.",
            "The new work seeks to prevent that. If it succeeds, it could open up new prospects for insect-based foods.\u00a0",
            "We need protein in our diets. That can come from sources such as beans, tofu, eggs or meat. Meat is high in protein. But some insect proteins may be healthier for us than the meat of larger animals, such as beef, fish or chicken. Farming insects is also better for the planet than other types of livestock. It uses less land, water and energy. And it produces fewer greenhouse gases, such as methane.",
            "Overall, \u201cinsects have shown great potential,\u201d says Yookyung Kim. She\u2019s a food scientist at Korea University in Seoul. Kim values insects\u2019 high protein content.",
            "But there\u2019s more. Many edible insects are full of vitamins and minerals. They also contain other compounds, such as amino acids and peptides, that can promote good health. In fact, some of these compounds are being studied to treat ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Extracting them from insects might lead to new health supplements.\u00a0",
            "To get there, science will have to pass a few hurdles. First is chitin (KY-tehn). It makes up the crunchy exoskeleton on many arthropods, from insects and arachnids to shellfish. Insect larvae contain some chitin, too. This sugar-based polymer binds to proteins and makes them hard to digest. So diners who eat whole insects won\u2019t get full nutritional benefit from their proteins.",
            "Treatment can separate out that chitin. Now, people can better absorb the protein.",
            "But there\u2019s still the yuck factor. Eating insects is normal in some parts of the world. Many of us don\u2019t want to eat insects, however \u2014 no matter how nutritious they may be. And it\u2019s hard to ignore that you\u2019re eating insects if you crunch on their legs or wings. That\u2019s a big reason why Kim focuses on turning the beneficial parts into a powder.",
            "Plus, she adds, powders are practical. They tend to last longer than whole insects and are easier to ship.",

Then, they mixed in one of three solutions to dissolve the proteins out of the defatted worms. One solution was sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Another contained a salt. The third contained enzymes. Lastly, they freeze-dried the mix to remove water. The leftover material was crushed into a powder.",
            "The fourth method was simpler. The team froze and then thawed the mealworms. Afterward, they ran the larvae through a screw press, which squished their tissue. This squeezed out any liquids. It\u2019s similar to how olive oil is extracted from whole olives. Next, the team strained the liquid and freeze-dried it (to remove water).

            "Catriona Lakemond is a food scientist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. She, too, works on insect proteins for human diners. And she finds the new data interesting. People are more likely to accept eating a powder rather than a whole insect, she says. Plus, she adds, extraction allows for the protein to find a wider range of uses.",

            "Food allergies are another factor, says food scientist Andrea Liceaga. People with shellfish allergies, she notes, may also be allergic to insects.",
            "Liceaga works with insect proteins at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. Her past work has shown that how protein is extracted can affect how likely it is to trigger an allergic reaction. So it will be critical to test insect-based products for allergens, she says.",

            "All these food scientists imagine us one day eating more insects. Which type and how they\u2019re prepared will probably depend on people\u2019s culture, says Liceaga. But at some point, insects will become just another ingredient.",

That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart.

            "Tiny as they are, paper cuts can cause real pain.",
            "It\u2019s common to get a minor cut while flipping through a magazine or book. But tissue paper is not likely to draw blood. Now, scientists have explained the physics behind why some paper is more likely to slice through skin.",
            "Physicist Kaare Jensen was part of a team that set up experiments to study this. They used a gelatin replica of human tissue. Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",
            "The most treacherous paper tested was the kind used in old-fashioned dot matrix printers. Good news for fingers everywhere: That paper isn\u2019t used much anymore. Magazine paper ranked a close second in the scientists\u2019 tests.",
            "The slicing angle also mattered. Pressing the paper\u2019s edge straight down into the gelatin was less likely to cause a cut than if the paper\u2019s path angled across and down.",
            "Next, the researchers put paper\u2019s slicing powers to use. They designed a 3-D printed tool they call the Papermachete. Loaded with a strip of printer paper, the tool becomes a single-use knife. The paper blade can cut into cucumber, pepper and apple. It can even cut chicken. The tool could be a low-cost option for prepping some foods.",
            "Next, the researchers plan to study more realistic, finger-shaped materials, rather than flat sheets of gelatin, says Jensen.",
            "No human fingers were harmed in the making of the study. \u201cIdeally, you would want some test subjects,\u201d Jensen says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to find volunteers.\u201d"

            "The heart beats steadily from long before you\u2019re born to the day you die. Triggering each beat (illustrated in background by an electrocardiogram line) is a zap of electricity \u2014 literally the pulse of life. ",
            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GMBSU-2GK3E?feature=oembed",
            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",

That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."

It requires stopping activities such as cattle ranching and mining that threaten Indigenous rights or damage their forests, and instead engaging with local producers to build the infrastructure they need to grow their businesses, such as electricity supplies for refrigerating and processing forest products, and reliable transportation to facilitate trade.

            "Jake M. Robinson: Back then, something like 45 to 60 percent of the terrestrial surface of Earth was covered in forests. It has rapidly changed. We have gone from about 6 billion hectares of forest to 4 billion. We have lost a third of the planet\u2019s forests in the last 10,000 years. About 50 percent of that loss has been just in the last 100 years or so. That\u2019s how much it\u2019s sped up since the Industrial Revolution. But the nature of forests is changing too. There are pockets of natural virgin forests left, but much of it is monoculture plantation.",

            "Robinson: No, there isn\u2019t a consensus. Some people have the idea that we should be restoring ecosystems back to what they were like before humans started intervening in them. Another view is we need to restore the functions and the processes of ecosystems and the biodiversity they support, not necessarily this ideal picture of what it was a few thousand years ago. I would like to see us recognize that humans are part of the ecosystem and that it\u2019s okay that we\u2019re altering the land: Indigenous peoples have been changing ecosystems for tens of thousands of years.\n",

            "Robinson: This was partly catalyzed by a 2019 Science study, which is quite controversial in the restoration ecology sector. They basically ran some models and showed that 900 million hectares is available to support forests, which could host about another a trillion trees. That simple idea took off, stratospherically. The authors weren\u2019t literally advocating planting a trillion trees, nor did they mean to imply that there aren\u2019t other essential ecosystems, like grasslands. It was all in good faith, and mostly a case of poor communication.",

            "Robinson: Restoration seems like a fairly straightforward idea, but it often goes wrong. In urban areas, around 30 percent of trees that are planted die within the first five years of life. If you plant trees in ecosystems where trees simply shouldn\u2019t be growing, you can remove the biodiversity that evolved with those niches. Probably the majority of ecosystem restoration projects fail or don\u2019t meet their stated goals. There\u2019s a big social element as well, because lots of people are already on the land that is put aside for tree planting; you can end up displacing them.

Several hundred years ago there were 100,000 Indigenous people supported by the forests in the Coixtlahuaca district, and now there\u2019s fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. The land can\u2019t support them, it\u2019s so degraded from agriculture and poor land management. Twenty years ago the soil was essentially rock. The local communities had to crush the rock so it could retain water, and then they planted these little nurse species \u2014 a non-native tree called Gregg\u2019s pines that\u2019s well adapted to poor conditions and won\u2019t reproduce \u2014 just to kickstart the ecosystem. These trees died and their carbon made it into the soil. It\u2019s an ongoing project \u2014 it\u2019s not yet a flourishing ecosystem \u2014 but it just shows that it can start from zero.",

It looks quite like a rainforest. He mostly focuses on non-annual plants \u2014 fruits and vegetables, nuts and mushrooms.

It\u2019s been quite eye-opening, and I think it\u2019ll be a useful monitoring tool in the future. We\u2019ve also recently found that white noise can stimulate fungi, promoting growth.

This extreme weather climate gap really touches on any vulnerable community \u2014 whether it\u2019s poor communities, communities of color, the very young, elderly \u2014 these communities are disproportionately impacted. They [often] have less resiliency or adaptive capacity. You\u2019re right, there were people in those same regions that were equally exposed and impacted, but they had the means to get in their car, maybe go to Atlanta, and stay in a hotel for a week.",
            "e360: Forecasts are getting more accurate in general, but we still don\u2019t know everything about hurricane intensity, right?",
            "Shepherd: The track forecasts have improved significantly. We still have a ways to go with the intensity forecast, and we know why. Track forecasts are governed more by the large steering conditions of the atmosphere that the models can pick up. But the intensity forecasts are governed by the ocean heat content, by the convection that\u2019s happening inside the clouds. These are things we don\u2019t often have readily available data on to go into the model. The energetics associated with hurricane intensification are related to things that aren\u2019t governed or explained as well by the large-scale models.",

They\u2019re supposed to happen in September and October. But the Gulf of Mexico was anomalously warm. You\u2019re getting these more intense storms, and they\u2019re rapidly intensifying. I think with Milton, it went from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in less than 24 hours. This explosive development is really a fingerprint of climate change.",

            "About 18 months ago, climate scientists began to notice something strange. In March of 2023, global sea surface temperatures started to rise. In a warming world, the seas would be expected to grow hotter, but the rise, which came at a time when the Pacific Ocean was in the neutral phase of the weather pattern known as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, was unusually steep. In April, 2023, sea surface temperatures set a new record. They did so again in May.\n",
            "As the months went on, the weirdness continued. In the summer of 2023, the world entered an El Ni\u00f1o, the warm phase of ENSO. El Ni\u00f1os typically bring higher temperatures, but in the second half of 2023, both sea surface and air temperatures increased so much that scientists were stunned. One called the figures \u201cabsolutely gobsmackingly bananas.\u201d\n",
            "In an essay that appeared in Nature this past March, NASA\u2019s chief climate scientist, Gavin Schmidt said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists\u2019 predictive capabilities more than 2023 has.\u201d\n",
            "Officially, the El Ni\u00f1o ended in May 2024. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high. This year they are expected to set yet another record.",
            "Schmidt says that scientists still can\u2019t explain the unexpected spike in temperatures. When I talked with him recently, he called the continuing confusion \u201ca little embarrassing\u201d for researchers.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/16359609/embed",
            "Scientists have identified several recent developments that could have contributed to the last year and a half of anomalous warmth. The first is a set of rules that reduced the sulfur content of the fuel used in super tankers. Since sulfur dioxide pollution reflects sunlight, this change, while good for public health, could have led to increased ocean heating. ",
            "A second potential contributor is an unusual eruption that occurred in January 2022. Normally, volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide and so produce temporary cooling. But the eruption of Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2018apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific, sent water vapor shooting into the stratosphere, which could have had a warming effect.",
            "Yet another possible contributor is the solar cycle. The sun is currently at, or near, a peak of activity, and this, too, could be boosting temperatures.",
            "At this point, though, Schmidt says, none of these developments \u2014 or even a combination of all of them \u2014 seems sufficient to explain the heat. This, in turn, raises several other possibilities. The recent temperature run-up could be the result of some development that\u2019s yet to be identified. Or it could mean the climate system is more unpredictable than was thought. Alternatively, it could indicate that something is missing from climate models, or that amplifying feedbacks are kicking in sooner than the models had predicted.\n",

            "Gavin Schmidt: We started to see something eyebrow-raising in the spring in 2023. We expected that 2023 would be another warm year because all of the years are warm now, but it probably wasn\u2019t going to be a record-warm year. So when the records started to be broken, first in the North Atlantic in March and April, June, and then the global mean in June, and then throughout the rest of the year, and then absolutely ridiculously large record-breaking events in the fall \u2014 August, September, October, November \u2014 people started using adjectives that scientists don\u2019t generally tend to use.",
            "At the end of 2023, we summed it up: It was a record warm year and it was a record-breaking size of the record. Our eyebrows at this point were rolling over the top of our heads. It was clear that the predictions that people had made at the beginning of year were all wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter what the method was, they were all wrong, and they were all wrong by about 0.2 degrees Celsius. Now that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a big deal. ",
            "You can accommodate a missed prediction in two ways. You can either say, your actual prediction was wrong. Or you can say, no, we underestimated the uncertainty.\n",
            "So at the beginning of 2024, we thought: Hopefully we\u2019ll get some more information from people doing science for all the different things that were happening. And maybe we\u2019ll get some more analyses of the internal variability. Some of that has happened, but not in a coordinated way. And it\u2019s still pretty much, I would say, amateur hour in terms of assessing what actually happened in 2023.",
            "Kolbert: There was a whole list of things people thought might have contributed.",

            "One other event was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u02bbapai volcano in the South Pacific, which was a very unusual eruption. It put a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is normally super dry. That was a very new thing, and people were saying, well, maybe that\u2019s contributing.",
            "People were also talking about unusual behavior of the Saharan dust or the wind pattern in the North Atlantic. People were talking about long-term, ongoing changes in how much pollution is coming from China and India. Maybe those things are changing faster than we anticipated. The pollution in the air is a cooling factor, and so if you take it away, then that\u2019s a warming factor.",
            "The science that\u2019s been done has not been equally spread amongst all of those things. A lot of people have looked at the impact of the marine shipping regulation change. If you take that and you put it into some climate model and you estimate the temperature change, right now you\u2019d expect about 0.05 of a degree, 0.08 of a degree [of warming per year], and then building over a decade to about 0.1 degree. So that seems like it helps, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s sufficient. And the first paper that came out about the volcano, they said, no, no, the normal cooling volcanic pollution is still bigger than the warming water vapor component. So now I have more warming to explain and less things to explain it.\n",

            "Schmidt: Like I said, there\u2019s two reasons why you could have messed up the prediction. One is you are missing some driving element. Another is you are underestimating the spread. Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off. And you could think of things being more off in multiple ways because the system is changing in a way where what happened in the past is no longer a good guide to what\u2019s going to happen in the future. And that\u2019s concerning. For example, we have huge industries and huge expectations based on temperature anomalies that are associated with [El Ni\u00f1o].\n",

If the connections between the rest of the world and what\u2019s happening in the tropical Pacific are changing, then all of those previous practices or recommendations based on the past relationships, maybe they\u2019re no longer any good.

That\u2019s very difficult to predict. I have this feeling that what we\u2019re doing will influence these decisions, but I don\u2019t know how it will influence these decisions. And so my best plan is just to do the best that we can in terms of the science and hope that by knowing more about the system, people will make better choices.

Plankton are at the base of the ocean food chain, feeding fish that feed billions of people. They are responsible for half of the world\u2019s oxygen supply and half of our planet\u2019s annual carbon sink. Miniscule but powerful, their presence can help or hinder ecosystems \u2014 by soaking up greenhouse gas, for example, or by spewing toxins. Where plankton live, how many there are, when they bloom and which species dominate each play a huge role in this delicate balance. And our changing climate is spurring a sea change in all of it.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re headed into an ocean and, for that matter, a world that we\u2019re not going to recognize because it\u2019s changing so fundamentally,\u201d says David Hutchins, a marine microbiologist at the University of Southern California, who has charted plankton\u2019s future.\n",
            "Climate change is hitting our oceans hard, making them warmer and more acidic, while radically altering currents. The outlook for plankton is mixed. Some studies report overall plankton numbers dropping, while others show them rising in some major ocean basins. As the planet warms, the diversity of the menagerie in many spots is increasing, says Clare Ostle, a marine biogeochemist at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. But certain species are losing out, she adds, including big juicy plankton thought to be important for food webs and carbon sequestration. And, in the long term, plankton numbers may plummet as climate change starves them of nutrients.\n",
            "BQScientists are shocked by the knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says one expert.",

They have some new technologies at their disposal, including a new NASA satellite called PACE \u2014 for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem \u2014 launched this February. And some old ones, including a decades-old program that painstakingly trawls the ocean with filters to scoop up tiny creatures and count them by hand. Yet scientists say they are shocked by the size of our knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says Ostle.",

There are phytoplankton that feed on sunlight and CO2, including glassy diatoms, dinoflagellates with whip-like tendrils, and spherical coccolithophores that are struggling against ocean acidification to build hard calcite shells. Others are zooplankton \u2014 tiny animals including shelled foraminifera, along with fish larvae, tiny worms, and even jellyfish. Some have a lifespan of just days; others, years.",

His modelling, in agreement with other work, predicts that as waters warm, plankton will move polewards at a rate of about 21 miles per decade. \u201cSome changes will be massive, like in the Arctic, where entire communities will be replaced by something new,\u201d he says. Phytoplankton seem better able to cope with gradual warming than zooplankton, Benedetti says, so their habitat range and diversity looks set to increase in most regions. But that\u2019s not necessarily good news: the most productive ocean regions, counterintuitively, have low diversity, Benedetti notes. And more diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher numbers of plankton overall.",
            "In the long term, researchers fear an overall decline in plankton numbers thanks to a dwindling supply of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and iron. Plankton typically rely on nutrients that have been mixed from the ocean bottom up to the surface. But melting polar ice and changing ocean currents are now increasing the density difference between top, fresh waters and deeper, saltier waters, making these layers ever-less-likely to mix. This increased \u201cstratification,\u201d as it is called, is expected to starve ever-more regions of the ocean. While some coastal regions are drowning in too much nitrogen, which runs off agricultural fields, much of the open ocean might become \u201cmore desert-like,\u201d says Hutchins.\n",
            "BQScientists have investigated dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. ",
            "A factor working against this trend is pollution from both the burning of fossil fuels and from wildfires, which can carry nutrients far out into ocean waters. The wildly destructive Australian wildfire season of 2019-2020, for example, poured so much nutritional iron into the water that phytoplankton concentrations doubled between New Zealand and South America, creating an algae bloom bigger than Australia that lasted for months. The biggest surprise was how long the blooms lasted, says Jakob Weis at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, who studied the phenomenon. The amount of carbon soaked up by those organisms is thought to have roughly matched the carbon spewed by the fires \u2014 a helpful factor in the context of climate change. \u201cWe intentionally refrained from framing the blooms as \u2018good news,\u2019 given the devastating impact the wildfires had on the Australian public, wildlife, terrestrial ecosystems, and climate,\u201d says Weis. But the plankton, at least, were \u201chappy.\u201d",
            "Such nutrient influxes could be a big deal, says Hutchins, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where waters are particularly starved of iron. But the long-term impacts are entirely unclear. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s going to balance out some of what\u2019s not mixing up from below, or if it\u2019s going to select for different communities, different species, because it\u2019s chemically different [food],\u201d says Hutchins. Such blooms won\u2019t make a big dent in the big-picture fight against global warming, adds Ostle. \u201cWe\u2019ve burned thousands of years of deposits of oil and gas. The phytoplankton blooms aren\u2019t going to be able to cut it.\u201d\n",

            "Since the 1990s, some small-scale experiments have investigated the idea of intentionally dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. But early tests suggested that such a geoengineering scheme might not be very effective at burying carbon in the seabed for the longterm, while being expensive and difficult to carry out \u2014 not to mention the possibly huge, unknown consequences for ocean life. There have been international moratoria against large-scale commercial fertilization efforts since 2008, but research into the idea continues. Just last month, Ken Buesseler at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and colleagues laid out a research agenda for how to best assess this strategy\u2019s possible risks and benefits. \u201cYou learn a lot from these experiments,\u201d says Benedetti, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t see this as a long-term solution.\u201d",
            "In the face of so much uncertainty, it\u2019s vital for researchers to get on-the-ground data about how plankton are faring. The longest-running program to do this is the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, an effort that has been attaching collection devices onto ocean-crossing ships since the 1930s. The technique is simple: Plankton get scooped out of surface waters and squashed onto a filter like bugs on a car windscreen. The filter rolls up as the ship moves along, creating a scroll-like record of plankton roadkill from across the ship\u2019s track. Those filters are delivered to a lab where they are unspooled and the plankton peered at through a microscope. About a dozen workers at the Marine Biological Association, the effort\u2019s headquarters, have been trained to identify more than 600 different types of tiny creature \u2014 a task they are now trying to bolster with artificial intelligence algorithms.\n",
            "BQIn the Atlantic around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining by around 10 percent per decade. ",
            "The vast majority of the CPR\u2019s data comes from the North Atlantic \u2014 a well-travelled region that happens to play an oversized role in global carbon uptake. Ostle, who heads up the Pacific Branch of the CPR, says the data here shows plankton biomass increasing near the pole and decreasing closer to the tropics, as expected.",
            "Most of the increase is, interestingly, diatoms, says Ostle \u2014 large, round phytoplankton that form juicy food balls for fish and which tend to sink quickly, making them good carbon storage bombs. \u201cIt was a surprise to see this,\u201d says Ostle. It\u2019s an important shift: \u201cDiatoms are really the engines of carbon fixation,\u201d says Hutchins, who estimates they are responsible for about half of phytoplanktons\u2019 total carbon uptake.\n",
            "Ostle suspects the explanation behind the unexpected North Atlantic diatom boom lies with sunlight. The increased ocean stratification that can stop nutrients from mixing upwards has also managed to trap diatoms in surface waters that are bathed in more light; they stay in the growing zone for longer. Eventually, says Ostle, the food disadvantage of increased stratification will likely outweigh the light advantage. But when and how remains uncertain.",

            "The story varies from region to region. In the northeast Atlantic, around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining at rates of around 10 percent per decade. Some researchers have even suggested that the infamous North Sea cod crash in the 1990s, usually attributed to overfishing, was exacerbated by a plankton deficit. In the Arctic Ocean, though, plankton numbers have blossomed, with productivity increasing by more than half between 1998 and 2018, thanks not just to more open water from melting ice but also to increased nutrients, possibly introduced to the Arctic by storms and shifting currents.",
            "There\u2019s less data in the North Pacific and in the subtropics, but both are now starting to show an important shift away from large diatoms towards dinoflagellates, says Ostle. These smaller creatures are less nutritious; fish have to work harder to eat more of them. \u201cThat could have really big implications for the fisheries. We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "Dinoflagellates are also the plankton responsible for bioluminescence \u2014 and, sometimes, for generating biotoxins that lead to shellfish poisoning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting big bioluminescent blooms off of Southern California,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty if you go out for a walk on the beach at night and the waves are all lighting up, but they also have toxins,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they [dinoflagellates] are going to be one of the winners too, in in the future warmer ocean.\u201d",

But it\u2019s hard, she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have funding at the moment to maintain this thing, so we do it voluntarily.\u201d While there are a dozen regional CPR surveys around the world, there are still huge swaths of the ocean where there\u2019s no regular plankton monitoring.",
            "Researchers can try to plug the gaps using satellites. But it takes decades to see long-term climate change impacts in plankton, which are so variable from season to season and year to year. Satellites typically measure color at the surface \u2014 a proxy for how chlorophyl-packed phytoplankton are doing.",
            "Last year, researchers reported that data from NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite showed that more than half of the world\u2019s oceans have gotten greener over the past 20 years. \u201cThat was a very nonintuitive finding for a lot of the community,\u201d says Hutchins. The implications are unclear. \u201cA \u2018greening\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily imply an increase in plankton abundance or productivity,\u201d says B.B. Cael of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, who led that work. \u201cWe tried to caution against this [interpretation], but I don\u2019t think the message got across.\u201d Instead, Cael says, the color change might be due to shifts from one kind of plankton to another.",

It can \u201csee\u201d in more than a hundred hues, rather than just the handful that previous satellites could spot.

And, she adds, the viruses that attack plankton seem to be on the rise as waters warm \u2014 another factor with as-yet unknown consequences.",
            "Thankfully, says Hutchins, plankton have proven to be pretty robust and adaptable over billions of years of Earth\u2019s history \u2014 so the oceanic food chain will persist in one form or another. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to drive ocean life to extinction,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be different dominant species \u2014 and maybe they\u2019re not going to be the ones we wish were there.\u201d",

            "Here in Burnt Corn Valley, smack in the middle of the Navajo reservation\u2019s vast Black Mesa region, the hilly land both craves water and is brutalized by it. The sandy Arizona soil cracks under a punishing August sun as red-striped blister beetles search for moisture across its baked surface. Cottonwood trees and sagebrush rise from deep gullies carved by floodwaters that, during the intensifying summer monsoon, sluice off surrounding mesas and wash away fragile topsoil \u2014 reminders that with climate change, even quenching rains harbor powers of destruction.",
            "This portrait of climatic havoc belies a softer reality, though. Farming once thrived in this parched region and could once again \u2014 if the right practices are adopted. Exhibit A: The crops on Roberto Nutlouis\u2019s 12-acre Sliding Rock Farm, in his reservation hometown of Pi\u00f1on, a five-hour drive north of Phoenix. \u201cThe corn is actually pretty big and thriving,\u201d Nutlouis says. He believes \u2014 and both Western science and the lived experience of his Native elders affirm \u2014 that the traditional rock and stick structures he\u2019s built on his property, which help store water and prevent erosion, have a lot to do with it. These structures, similar to those used by Native peoples long before Europeans arrived on the continent, are not only delivering water to crops (the broader, 27,000-square-mile reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S.). They are also restoring Nutlouis\u2019s watershed and those of his neighbors, helping to sequester carbon, and reviving this high-desert ecosystem. It\u2019s all part of a bigger effort among a range of local and regional grassroots organizations to build back the reservation\u2019s fragile, depleted ecosystems and bring greater sovereignty over food, water, and health to its communities.\n",
            "BQPeople living in arid zones have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture water for crops.",
            "Din\u00e9 (the Navajo name for themselves) are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive. Depending on elevation, precipitation in Black Mesa averages 6 to 16 inches a year; recent heat extremes \u2014 the Navajo government declared a state of emergency in 2023 due to soaring temperatures \u2014mean that the scant water evaporates more quickly. Climate models predict the region will experience increasing droughts that decimate plant life, part of a growing trend of human-caused desertification across the globe, as well as higher-intensity seasonal rainfall, which can sweep away crops and roads. The ecological health of the reservation has also been weakened by deforestation from timbering operations and from overgrazing over the years.",
            "Still, this season, Nutlouis, 44, has been able to skip his usual two-hour roundtrip drive to a reliable well to haul water home for his corn. His crop is healthy and hydrated because his land still holds last winter\u2019s snowmelt. Clearly, his heavy labor over the past 20 years \u2014 during which he has built woven brush dams, gabions (wirework cages filled with rocks), earthen berms, concrete spillways and trenches, limestone aprons and walls, and stone-lined \u201cZuni bowls,\u201d which stabilize eroding streambeds \u2014 is paying off.",

            "Din\u00e9 and others living in arid zones around the world have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture and control water to grow crops and to mitigate the devastation of floods in ephemeral stream systems. Various Puebloans, including Zuni and Hohokam, used similar devices, as did the Aztecs. Arab peoples and tribes in India have incorporated stone water diversions for thousands of years. \u201c[M]ost traditional Indigenous communities are not passive observers of nature,\u201d writes Lyla June Johnston, a Din\u00e9 anthropologist and community organizer. Instead, they are \u201cinfluential facilitators of landscape scale abundance, rooted in an ethic of kinship and reverence.\u201d",
            "Time and again over the last 15 years, Laura Norman, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has seen evidence that when these structures \u2014 which Norman calls Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams, or NIDS \u2014 are placed in gullies, they slow water to mitigate erosion, collect nutrient-rich sediment and plant debris that nourish both crops and wild plants, help store carbon, improve groundwater recharge, and increase downstream water availability by as much as 28 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect that counters degradation, and you get all of these ecosystem services,\u201d she says.",
            "The structures on Nutlouis\u2019s farm are integral cogs in a larger system of floodplain farming. It works like this: Nutlouis\u2019s property lies in an alluvial fan, where mineral-rich sediments and plant waste atop mesas and other uplands wash down onto flatter ground with rainwater, snowmelt, and spring water. Across the valley, similar farms rely on this kind of system, many of which feature stone and stick constructions that Nutlouis helped build. The organic materials trapped behind the structures, says Jonathan Sandor, an emeritus agronomy professor at Iowa State University, \u201care a major input into keeping the fertility of the soils up.\u201d Such small watersheds are optimal: \u201cThese gentle slopes and small watersheds allow runoff but reduce the possibility of high runoff velocities that may damage crops,\u201d Sandor explained in a 2008 paper.",
            "BQ\u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d says an expert.",
            "Whether rock walls or ramps, hand-dug depressions in the soil, earthen walls, or branches plaited into dams, NIDS splash water over a wider area and slow its flow so it can better soak into the soil. Many trap sediments behind them, fertilizing whatever grows nearby. The stone structures create a hyperlocal cooling effect, especially when they\u2019re combined with shade-making vegetation.",
            "Here, too, smallness is a boon. \u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d Norman says. Up to five kilometers downstream from such structures, \u201cwe\u2019ve documented increased vegetation despite drought. We\u2019ve also documented [increased vegetation] up to one kilometer upstream, which indicates water availability.\u201d In this way, an alluvial farm and its NIDS can support plants both sown and wild.\n",
            "\u201cThe moisture we get from winter precipitation is really important for the corn to germinate and grow,\u201d says Nutlouis, \u201cand the monsoon rain is really important to finish our harvest of corn and squash and melons.\u201d He acknowledges that in practice this can look chaotic, with cornfields flooded up to their ears before the water trickles down to the next field.",

            "But lately, climate change has thrown extra challenges at the reservation. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious soil moisture deficit that\u2019s causing a lot of ecological shifts,\u201d Nutlouis says. Much of Black Mesa\u2019s pinyon forest, he says, has succumbed to two decades of drought. Historically, Din\u00e9 have foraged for pinyon pine nuts. They are an important component of food sovereignty on the reservation, and their loss is acutely felt.",
            "But the ecosystem services provided by Nutlouis\u2019s structures on his farm and elsewhere do seem to be meeting those climatic challenges. He\u2019s noticed small juniper trees popping up on hillsides around his property despite the dryness; A cottonwood tree towering over one cornfield is also lush and full. \u201cThe idea that Earth will restore itself with natural seed dispersal\u201d after NIDS begin to do their job \u201chas been my observation,\u201d says Norman. Or as Nutlouis puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re allowing nature to do its own thing and restore itself.\u201d",
            "Still, Nutlouis is inclined to help the process along. His nonprofit Nihikeya (loosely translated as a collective ecological footprint) collaborates with a variety of local and regional grassroots groups that work on food, water, and justice issues, like Tolani Lake Enterprises, First Nations Development Institute, and the Ten Tribes Partnership. Din\u00e9 C.A.R.E., another collaborator, is an environmental justice organization that advocates for community health and land rights across the reservation, as well as for the cleanup of coal- and uranium-polluted rivers and aquifers. \u201cWe especially want to support a lot of renewable projects through solar and wind, and we want to support agriculture too, because having a robust food system is a form of revenue for local farmers,\u201d says executive director Robyn Jackson. \u201cIt also helps with continuing our cultural traditions.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to farming into the future,\u201d says a Navajo activist.",
            "Nihikeya also works closely with the water-rights organization T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed, whose members are collecting native plant seeds to restore riparian habitat across Black Mesa. Some of those native plants, like wolfberry, are edible, which will also help improve food sovereignty and security. \u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to continuing farming into the future,\u201d says T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed executive director Nicole Horseherder.",
            "To house accessions of pinyon and juniper, willow, wolfberry bush, three-leaf sumac, and rabbit brush, Nutlouis is building a seed bank. When put back into the landscape, these plants will help keep the ground moist and mitigate erosion.\n",
            "Nutlouis is working on his master\u2019s degree in sustainable communities at Northern Arizona University, where he studies the Western science that qualifies and quantifies the benefits of traditional practices. But he is also adamant that watershed restoration success is predicated on reforging ancestral kinship connections \u2014 that is, on returning the power to make land-use decisions to clan mothers, who were traditionally Din\u00e9 leaders in this arena. To that end, he\u2019s been meeting with neighbors in one tiny watershed of Burnt Corn Valley after another to discuss how to improve the health of their land, whether for growing corn or just ensuring roads remain intact when it rains. So far, Nutlouis has helped restore 56 fields across the valley, with more NIDS than he can count.",

One of her NIDS study sites saw its water availability extended from three months to four months. \u201cYou can envision how important that is for arid lands,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this kind of farming way before the Europeans came, and that\u2019s what our ancestors were known for,\u201d says Nutlouis. \u201cThe work we do is looking back at ancestral wisdom, reclaiming and re-correcting knowledge, de-colonizing and re-Indigenizing.\u201d He continues, \u201cEcologies needs to be restored.

            "Some 50 miles southwest of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, and strategically located close to a cluster of the island\u2019s top universities, the 3,500-acre Hsinchu Science Park is globally celebrated as the incubator of Taiwan\u2019s most successful technology companies. It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. ",
            "Today Taiwan\u2019s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan\u2019s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. ",
            "It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent.\n",

            "Taiwan\u2019s more than 23 million people consume nearly as much energy per capita as U.S. consumers, but the lion\u2019s share of that consumption \u2014 56 percent \u2014 goes to Taiwan\u2019s industrial sector for companies like TSMC. In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan\u2019s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s government is banking on the continuing success of its technology sector and wants the island to be a leader in A.I. But just one small data center, the Vantage 16MW Data center in Taipei, is expected to require as much energy as some 13,000 households. Nicholas Chen, a lawyer who analyses Taiwan\u2019s climate and energy policies, warns that the collision of Taiwan\u2019s commitments to the clean energy transition and its position in global supply chains as a key partner of multinational companies that have made commitments to net-zero deadlines \u2014 along with the explosive growth in demand \u2014 has all the makings of a crisis.\n",
            "\u201cIn order to plan and operate A.I. data centers, an adequate supply of stable, zero-carbon energy is a precondition,\u201d he said. \u201cA.I. data centers cannot exist without sufficient green energy.

In addition, for political reasons, the government has pledged to close its nuclear sector by 2025.",
            "Taiwan regularly attends U.N. climate meetings, though never as a participant. Excluded at China\u2019s insistence from membership in the United Nations, Taiwan asserts its presence on the margins, convening side events, and adopting the Paris Agreement targets of peak emissions before 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. Its major companies, TSMC included, have signed up to RE100, a corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged to achieve net zero production. But right now, there is a wide gap between aspiration and performance. ",
            "Angelica Oung, a journalist and founder of the Clean Energy Transition Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for a rapid energy transition, has studied Taiwan\u2019s energy sector for years. When we met in a restaurant in Taipei, she cheerfully ordered an implausibly large number of dishes that crowded onto the small table as we talked. Oung described two major blackouts \u2014 one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge.\n",

            "Taiwan\u2019s current energy mix illustrates the scale of the challenge: Last year, Taiwan\u2019s power sector was 83 percent dependent on fossil fuel: Coal accounted for around 42 percent of generation; natural gas 40 percent; and oil 1 percent. Nuclear supplied 6 percent, and solar, wind, hydro, and biomass together, nearly 10 percent, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, which leaves the island at the mercy both of international price fluctuations and potential blockade by China. The government has sought to shield consumers from rising global prices, but that has resulted in growing debt for the Taiwan Electric Power Company (Taipower), the national provider. In the event of a naval blockade by China, Taiwan could count on about six weeks reserves of coal but not much more than a week of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Given that LNG supplies more than a third of electricity generation, the impacts would be severe. \n",

The 2050 net-zero roadmap released by Taiwan\u2019s National Development Council in 2022 promised to shut down its nuclear sector by 2025. By the same year, the share of coal would have to come down to 30 percent, gas would have to rise to 50 percent, and renewables would have to leap to 20 percent. None of those targets is on track. ",
            "Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. \u201cThe problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don\u2019t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.\u201d Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks.",
            "According to Peter Kurz, a consultant to the technology sector and a long-term resident of Taiwan, there is one renewable resource that the nation has in abundance. \u201cThe Taiwan Strait has a huge wind resource,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the most wind power anywhere in the world available close to a population.\u201d",

            "Offshore wind is under development, but the government is criticized for imposing burdensome requirements to use Taiwanese products and workers that the country is not well equipped to meet. They reflect the government\u2019s ambition to build a native industry at the same time as addressing its energy problem. But critics point out that Taiwan lacks the specialist industrial skills that producing turbines demands, and the requirements lead to higher costs and delays.",
            "Despite the attraction of Taiwan\u2019s west coast with its relatively shallow waters, there are other constraints, such as limited harbor space. There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan\u2019s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters from China\u2019s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable.",
            "Government critics regard one current policy as needless self-harm: the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor by next year and achieve a \u201cnuclear free homeland.\u201d It is a pledge made by the current ruling party, the Democratic People\u2019s Party (DPP) and, as the deadline approaches, it is a policy increasingly being questioned. Taiwan\u2019s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978. The DPP came into existence in 1986, the year of the Chernobyl disaster, and its decision to adopt a no-nuclear policy was reinforced by the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan in 2011.",

The shuttered reactors have not yet been decommissioned, possibly because, in addition to its other difficulties, Taiwan has run out of waste storage capacity: The fuel rods remain in place because there is nowhere else to put them. As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change.

A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geoengineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change.",
            "Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral \u2014 eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",

They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can\u2019t wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t mitigate our way out of this,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe need other tools.\u201d\n",
            "Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls.\n",
            "Back in 1978, glaciologist John Mercer, of Ohio State University, warned of a \u201cmajor disaster \u2013 a rapid five-meter rise in sea level, caused by deglaciation of West Antarctica\u201d \u2014 should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise. Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",

            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.

The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",
            "Moore calls the bubble barrier a \u201cwild card.\u201d But, he says, \u201cit is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.\u201d Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched.",
            "BQAn Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides.",
            "There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "In an ideal world, Scambos says, \u201cwe could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.\u201d But the world isn\u2019t like that.

We need a social licence.\u201d He agrees that there are other important causes of current and future sea-level rise. But \u201cnone of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.\u201d",

Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",

Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",

Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",
            "Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology for the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council, a global nonprofit that works to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage, cautions that 10-hour energy-storage solutions will help us get through the swing from night to day, but that we produce and consume renewable energy on a scale that spans seasons.\n",
            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

            "After sitting dormant since the 1980s, the Pinyon Plain uranium mine began operating in January on the Kaibab National Forest in Arizona, about seven miles south of the Grand Canyon. Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",
            "BQThe world will need up to 100,000 tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean doubling mining.",
            "Another driver of the search for new sources of uranium, which is essential to nuclear reactors, is geopolitics. The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts. But based on the industry\u2019s track record of polluting air, water, and soil with both radioactivity and heavy metals, and its obfuscation of mining\u2019s environmental threats, many observers \u2014 especially Indigenous people, who have borne the brunt of past uranium mining and who still suffer health problems linked with unremediated mining sites \u2014 remain skeptical.\n",
            "Exploration continues nonetheless. \u201cEveryone is convinced there is going to be a much larger demand for uranium going forward,\u201d said Matthew L.

            "If small modular reactors \u2014 units that can produce up to 300 megawatts of energy \u2014 prove efficient and economical, Wald says, they could be mass produced quickly and further increase the demand for uranium. There are plans for several small modular reactors, which have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, currently underway in the U.S. and Canada. \n",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world will need up to 100,000 metric tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean nearly doubling mining from current levels. And so companies around the globe are both looking for new deposits and reopening old mines. In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",

            "Greenland, meanwhile, is going against this trend. Concerned with the possible health impacts of mining, the Indigenous Inuit government in 2021 banned prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of uranium. And in 2023 it denied a permit for an Australian company to mine a massive deposit of rare earth metals called Kvanefjeld because bringing them to the surface would also convey uranium, with which it is commingled. ",
            "What will this new era of uranium mining mean for the environment? Historically, the industry has polluted groundwater, surface water, and soil around the world with radioactive waste and dust, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage. In some places, damage has been remediated by industry and government. But in many cases, due to cost or the difficulty of remediation, the pollution still contaminates the environment.",
            "But supporters of uranium mining say that new methods and technologies are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past and have far smaller footprints. That\u2019s because most new mines now use in-situ leaching, in which ore is left in the ground and miners recover the earth\u2019s minerals by dissolving them with hydrogen peroxide or an acid or alkaline leach.

Fifty-seven percent of the world\u2019s total uranium was produced using in-situ leaching in 2019, up from 16 percent in 2000, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group.",

The Obama administration proposed tighter standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by in-situ uranium mining, with a focus on groundwater protection and restoration, but the Trump administration rolled those regulations back. According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this.

The company pumped this excess water into an open-air holding pond. But the pond wasn\u2019t big enough, so the company used water cannons to spray the overflow, which was tainted with arsenic and uranium at levels well above federal standards, into the sky to enhance the evaporation rate.\n",

The testes took even longer to find.

To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",

Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

What you need is a very controlled level of fishing, but we have to work on all the environmental factors.\u201d",
            "Durif acknowledges that the EU still needs some convincing from the scientific community before it will accept a zero-catch limit. \u201cThe EU is working on making a special request to ICES to see if we can measure the efficiency of the regulation, which we keep on saying we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

            "The mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",
            "Kerr has been writing to the EU for over a decade and has spoken to gathered authorities at the Hague on the problem of illegal glass eel shipments. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to make eel become an EU priority in countertrafficking,\u201d he said. In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",
            "BQIn Sweden, the threat of hydropower plants to migrating eels is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing.",
            "Eel fishermen around Europe fear their livelihoods being put on hold by a fishing ban, and they argue that the authorities should be addressing other known mortality factors. In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years. The population numbers continue to go down; soon we risk going underneath the survival threshold of the species.\u201d"

All seven sea turtle species are currently endangered or threatened, notes Christine Figgener, a German-born conservation biologist who has been working in Costa Rica for the past 16 years. ",
            "The number of nesting females on the beaches she studies is down more than 80 percent from when she first arrived there, Figgener said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. It\u2019s part of a global decline driven by a perfect storm of threats including plastics in the ocean, chemical pollution, industrial fishing, unregulated coastal development, and climate change.",
            "Figgener, 40, gained international attention when a video that she took of a sea turtle with a plastic straw lodged in its nostril went viral. The video helped launch a movement to eliminate plastic straws, which led to bans in Seattle and other cities around the world. But she says that\u2019s only a start. \u201cOur world, our oceans are much too complex to say that if we just stop eating fish or using plastic straws or what have you, sea turtles will be safe,\u201d she said.",

I\u2019d never seen a sea turtle nesting before. It is this ancient creature larger than I am that goes through a life program that they have been following for millions of years. I quickly fell in love with sea turtles and felt guilt, in a way, too. I mean they have been around for such an incredibly long period of time. Here they are on the brink of extinction because of us humans. I just felt \u2014 that cannot happen, at least not in my lifetime.",

We also have a massive problem with erosion [of beaches where turtles nest] due to rising sea levels.",
            "Nesting season is just now beginning here on the Caribbean coast. We are seeing one or two females nesting a night. When I first began my work here [in 2007] we were seeing 800 leatherback females nesting in a season. Now we are down to 50 to 150 on our beach. That downward trend is happening all over the world.\n",

Or in some cases the ocean would wash them away if they were buried too low down on the beach. So what we do is we put a little bag under the female while she is laying the eggs and we take the eggs to a more secure place to rebury them. We are careful to leave no track, so the poachers won\u2019t know where they are.",

But when we started pulling it out and snipped off a little piece, it became clear that it was plastic straw.",

We also have the problem of so-called ghost nets, nets that were lost or dumped and abandoned. Once a turtle gets entangled in a ghost net, they drag this big weight behind them. In some cases, they are not able to move at all. It also leads to many nasty cuts, amputations, and limb loss in sea turtles.

In green turtles there is a type of cancer called fibropapillomatosis, which creates cauliflower-shaped tumors on soft tissue, like the eyes and the skin, and is basically triggered by fertilizer runoff.

            "Figgener: A lot of things came together in the favor of the Kemp ridleys. Back in the late 70s and 80s there were only a few hundred nesting females left in the Gulf of Mexico. These turtles often ended up in the nets of shrimp trawlers. In response, the U.S. mandated a turtle excluding device attached to the nets which reduced bycatch by about 90 percent.",

            "Some eggs were transported from Mexico to Texas where [a nesting colony was re-established at Padre Island National Seashore.] And there was a \u201chead start program\u201d in the U.S. in which eggs were incubated in a controlled environment and then grown until they were the size of a plate and no longer so vulnerable to predation as tiny baby sea turtles are when they are born.

We always have students from outside Costa Rica, and tourists. I think that passion that makes people travel all that way to see a nesting sea turtle definitely changes something in the mindset of the people who live here.

By the end of his probe into the supply chain of JBS, the world\u2019s largest meat processing and packing company, Marcel Gomes reckons he and his team at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based nonprofit Rep\u00f3rter Brasil knew more about the origins of the beef it supplies from the Amazon to the world\u2019s hamburger chains and supermarkets than the company itself. ",
            "With grassroots support from labor unions and Indigenous communities, he had mapped the complex networks of cattle farms responsible for illegal deforestation. He then tracked the often-illicit beef through JBS\u2019s slaughterhouses and packing plants to the freezers, shelves, and customer trays of retail outlets and fast-food restaurants around the world. When his sleuths were done, the fingerprints of forest destruction were plain to see. Six of Europe\u2019s biggest retail chains reacted by halting purchases of JBS beef. \n",

My country has more than 200 million cattle, and ranching is the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, where more than 40 percent of the cattle are raised. JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company.

So, at Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which was founded in 2008, we began to collect this public data on everything related to environmental, social, and labor issues. We started to cross-check the data so we could trace supply chains right from the ranch to consumers.",

So, in 2021, we hired researchers in Europe and the U.S., as well as Brazil, to visit stores to find Brazilian beef and take pictures of the seals and export tracking numbers. Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from. For us it was very important to go to the supermarkets and take pictures, and to have that clear evidence.",
            "Then we connected both ends of the supply chain, and called everybody \u2014 the supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, the traders, JBS, the public health authorities, everyone \u2014 to tell them what we had found and ask for them to respond. Several supermarket chains in Europe believed our findings straight away and announced boycotts just as our report was published.

            "Gomes: Yes. It is common to move cattle from farm to farm in Brazil, often three or four times. There can be legitimate reasons for doing this, because cattle raising is quite a specialized business. But it can also cover up a \u201cdirty\u201d trail.",
            "In theory there are rules to prevent the trading of cattle from illegal to legal areas. But in practice it is very easy to do, especially when you have several members of a family doing the same business. One brother can move cattle to the land of another brother, with no paperwork. Also, you can change the boundaries of your own land, for instance, by turning one ranch into two, one clean and the other dirty. Then you can just trade with companies like JBS from the clean part. \n",

A local shepherd named \u00c7oban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf, once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels \u2014 a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory \u2014 were soon to be erased.",

            "*Electric_school_buses_charging_up_in_Oakland,_California,_last_month",
            "About 20 million students in the United States ride to school each day on the familiar yellow bus. The vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 490,000 school buses \u2014 which comprise the nation\u2019s largest public-transportation fleet \u2014 are powered by diesel engines. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning our kids on the way to school,\u201d said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children\u2019s lungs.",
            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",
            "*Children_aboard_an_electric_school_bus_in_Chevy_Chase,_Maryland,_last_February",
            "fCChildren aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February.\nTom Brenner / AP Photo.",
            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19371586/embed",
            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "fCA technician converts a conventional school bus to an electric school bus at a facility in Holbrook, New York, March 2023.\nGabby Jones / Bloomberg via Getty Images",
            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",

            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation.

When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",

But it declined to answer questions from Yale Environment 360 about whether it supports the ruling or will help to implement it.",

It finds that the DRC government has violated 11 articles on human rights in the African Charter, to which it is a signatory. These include the rights of the Batwa to life, property, natural resources, development, health, religion, and culture. And it calls on the government to adopt into law as soon as possible \u201can effective mechanism for the delimitation, demarcation and titling of the territory traditionally occupied by the Batwa and the various natural resources attached to it in accordance with their tradition,\u201d and to annul all laws \u201cprohibiting the presence of the Batwa on ancestral lands and the enjoyment of the fruits of these lands.\u201d",

According to an attorney based in Bukavu, who is part-Batwa and has been following the case closely, the government has all along attempted to thwart the commission\u2019s investigation. \u201cIt has never responded to correspondence addressed to it by the Commission, nor appeared before it, even though it is a signatory member of the African Charter.\u201d (Neither the commission nor the DRC government has responded to requests for comment.)",

",
            "The forced eviction of Indigenous people, such as the Batwa, from their ancestral lands across Africa has been widespread for decades. Usually carried out in the name of conservation, it has in the past often been planned, helped, and funded by Western conservation groups such as the WCS and World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization\u2019s work in the region.",
            "The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians \u2014 more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them.",
            "The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month \u2014 signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists \u2014 contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not \u201cdetract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d noting their \u201clands include more than one-third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes.\u201d",

            "Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas. UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site and calls it \u201cone of the ecologically richest regions of Africa.\u201d",
            "But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

            "Many armed groups stayed on after the civil wars, setting up crude mining operations for coltan (used in cellphones and personal computers), cassiterite (tin ore), and gold. Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",
            "BQ\u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that \u201cpark guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.\u201d",
            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas. The result, he says, is \u201cthousands of hectares of deforestation,\u201d visible in satellite images.",

            "Simpson accuses human rights lobbyists of having an \u201coverly idealized image of the Batwa as ecologically noble savages.\u201d Even so, he says the Batwa are minor players in a wider economy of ecological destruction. The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides \u201cideal hideouts\u201d for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is \u201cthe only feasible form of enforcement.\u201d",
            "But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",
            "\u201cDoes the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

I realized that I lived in a community that was surrounded by billion-dollar industries that had very little resources for people who looked like me. I got on Facebook and asked, \u201cWho needs help?\u201d So many people needed food. They needed water. People were newly homeless.",
            "I was looking at the connections between industrial pollution, the storms that were happening across Louisiana and Texas, and the proposed industry coming along the Gulf Coast. I was beginning to recognize how all of this was connected when I heard about these 20 proposed LNG terminals. My first question was, \u201cWhere are they going to go?\u201d I had this overwhelming feeling that they were going to push out more Black communities.

I get a few small grants from organizations, but a lot of the funding comes from crowdsourcing from across the U.S. I assist people with food, shelter, water, clothing, paying their utility bills, paying their rent. But then they come to our community outreach meetings, they protest. [In late June] I was able to organize over 200 people from Texas and Louisiana to march with over 1,000 people down Wall Street to tell banks to stop funding environmental racism in our communities. I can\u2019t talk to a person in my community about CP2 coming when they can\u2019t feed their families, when they can\u2019t pay their rent.

            "Ozane: I\u2019m originally from Mississippi. When we first came to Louisiana in 2003, I immediately knew that those industries were bad because we could see the fires and the smoke. The air smelled like rotten eggs one day and like Clorox the next. It made me sick. One of my sisters who worked at a petrochemical plant ended up being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. Her job was to watch the flare to see how big or small it would be, but she didn\u2019t know what was coming out of that thing.\n",

He had his first seizure while driving between two facilities that had flares going. Those flares are loud, they are bright, and those are seizure-triggering things. It was also a couple days after the explosion at [a local refinery]. I tried to get answers, but everybody I talked to said that the chemicals released from these facilities disappear out of your blood quickly.\n",

The state of Louisiana has said that even though cancer rates are going up, there is no way to say that they\u2019re going up because industry has grown. Louisiana is third in the nation for cancer rates. People hear about Cancer Alley, not understanding that the entire state of Louisiana is a cancer state.

The Vessel Project fought coal in Westlake, Louisiana, and right behind coal came LNG. And right behind LNG, now, you have [new] petrochemical plants.
