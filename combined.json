Storybooks often show male frogs croaking by ballooning the bottoms of their mouths out in one fat, round bubble.\u00a0But only half of frog species croak that way. The rest use a huge\u00a0range of body parts for their ribbitting.",
            "Some males use a pair of brilliant blue puff-out disks. They look sort of like padded headphones that have slipped down the frog\u2019s neck. Other species have sacs that look like khaki-colored-balloon Mickey Mouse ears. Still others ribbit with a single upright sac. It looks a bit like a fat rhino horn on some inflatable swimming pool toy.",
            "In a new study, two herpetologists looked at 4,358 species of frogs and toads. (Herpetologists are experts on amphibians and reptiles.) All together, the team found frogs and toads had evolved 20 basic forms of vocal sacs. And about one in every six of the species studied had no vocal sacs at all.",
            "Agust\u00edn El\u00edas-Costa and Juli\u00e1n Faivovich did the research. Both work at the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Science Museum. That\u2019s in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The two shared their findings March 7 in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History.\u00a0",

            "Their survey showed that vocal sacs disappeared between 146 and 196 times across the frog and toad family tree. That\u2019s \u201can astounding number considering their biological importance,\u201d El\u00edas-Costa says.",
            "Even animals without sacs still emit sounds. Like human speech, frog and toad ribbits come from the larynx. Vocal sacs make the sound louder. They convey how attractive a male frog is, too. But they can tip off\u00a0eavesdropping\u00a0predators.",
            "Female frogs of a few species also vocalize. But mostly it\u2019s a male endeavor.",

Some even find each other in tiny pools at the sunken centers of bromeliad leaves. Every locale has different risks and acoustic issues. Frogs must have different types of vocal sacs to succeed in each.",

These electric-blue and tangerine-colored sea slugs graze on colonies of little polyps called hydrozoans. But they\u2019re a little picky. The sea slugs prefer eating polyps that have just had a meal themselves. Hydrozoans are predators that catch and eat plankton. So, the sea slug chows down on plankton-stuffed polyps in this two-for-one meal deal.",

Fewer than one in three would let their teen walk alone to a coffee shop. And only one in five would be okay with their teen wandering solo around an amusement park.",
            "Those results, released June 16, are troubling, says public health expert Sarah Clark. She codirects the C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health. Teenagers, she says, need freedom to develop the confidence that they can navigate the world on their own.",

            "Psychologist Peter Gray is part of a team that wrote about this almost two years ago in The Journal of Pediatrics. For instance, compared with previous generations, children across much of the Western world are less likely to hold part-time jobs. They also are less likely to walk or bike to school alone. Parents report increasing discomfort with letting their kids engage in risky, unsupervised play, other research shows.",

            "Vacations present an ideal time for teens to practice independence, says Clark. Parents can plan where to stay to give teens more freedom. And they can set guidelines. For example, they can ask their teen to text when they get to their destination. Or families can agree on when and where to meet up.",
            "Clark does sees some promising signs. Two-thirds of the parents polled felt confident their teens would follow their rules even without them around.",
            "The goal shouldn\u2019t be to protect teens from all dangers. Instead, says Clark, adults need to help them practice life skills. This might mean riding public transit, knowing what to do when approached by a stranger or ordering a sandwich on their own.",

            "Plus, the 25 most-viewed videos had an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients. These can cause an itching, burning, tingling or prickling sensation.",
            "The most common of these ingredients were alpha-hydroxy acids. These chemicals exfoliate skin, removing surface layers. They\u2019re common in anti-aging products because they can smooth fine lines and wrinkles and improve skin texture. They\u2019re also used in some products to prevent acne. But they can irritate and damage young skin.",
            "Creators used products with alpha-hydroxy acids an average of three times per video and as many as seven times in one regimen. This is harmful because the chemical becomes more irritating the more you layer it.",
            "Alpha-hydroxy acids also increase the skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends staying out of the sun and using sunscreen with these products. But on average, only 26 percent of the TikTok videos included any type of sun protection. So these regimens would boost the risk of sunburn and other sun damage.",
            "Though not part of the study, pediatrician Molly O\u2019Shea was distressed by the findings. \u201cThe majority of the products that were being shown and demonstrated weren\u2019t designed for young skin,\u201d says O\u2019Shea. She practices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.",

These types of products are usually meant for people whose skin has begun to show signs of aging, says O\u2019Shea. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, using products that are designed for older skin can actually damage your skin.\u201d",

            "The products seemed to be used as status symbols, says Hales. \u201cThat may make someone feel bad if they don\u2019t have the money or they\u2019re not in a position to be able to afford that kind of skincare routine.\u201d Studies have shown that comparing yourself to others who seem \u201cbetter\u201d can have big drawbacks, especially for teens. \u201cIt can have a harmful effect on your self-image,\u201d says Hales.",
            "The study didn\u2019t look at who was consuming this content, says Hales. But this type of media could pose a risk of adverse mental health outcomes for kids and teens who view it, she notes.",
            "The team also paid attention to skin tone. In the United States, beauty standards traditionally have been linked to ideals of whiteness. The researchers wanted to see if the videos idealized white skin.",
            "The majority of content creators they viewed had light skin. But since TikTok\u2019s feed is driven by an algorithm, the researchers don\u2019t know how well what they saw reflects the whole platform. The early videos they saw and engaged with may have prompted more videos from creators with light skin to appear in their feed.",

At that point, she advises teens to talk to their doctor. \u201cPediatricians are usually very equipped to manage mild to moderate acne,\u201d says Hales. If it\u2019s anything more severe, she recommends seeing a dermatologist.",

Second, read the labels of the products you\u2019re using and see what kind of active ingredients they have. Third, look for fragrance-free products, since fragrance is the most common cause of skin allergy.",
            "Hales sees no harm in spending money on safe products that you put on from time to time because it feels luxurious or you enjoy it. But know that you don\u2019t need elaborate skincare routines to take care of your skin. \u201cIn most cases,\u201d she says, \u201cthose products are probably making the skin less healthy, rather than more healthy.\u201d"

            "Chili peppers famously bring the heat to hot sauces, salsas, curries and many other dishes. And if you\u2019ve ever bitten into food that\u2019s too spicy, you know how much they can burn. But now, it seems that certain compounds tame the flames of some peppers\u2019 taste.",
            "It remains a mystery how the newly identified compounds cut down on spiciness, or pungency. But chili peppers that contain more of these molecules don\u2019t have quite as much kick. These findings could one day help farmers grow and develop new kinds of peppers and even aid in pain relief, scientists say.",
            "A chili pepper\u2019s spice level is often measured with the Scoville scale. This scale is based on two compounds that give peppers their heat. One is capsaicin. The other is dihydrocapsaicin. Peppers that contain more of these compounds rank higher on the Scoville scale.",
            "But even when two peppers have the same Scoville rating, one might taste hotter than the other. Devin Peterson and his colleagues wanted to find out why. Peterson is a flavor scientist at Ohio State University in Columbus.",
            "Pepper spiciness is usually measured with the Scoville scale. Peppers that contain more of two spice-causing compounds rate higher on the scale. Bell peppers have the lowest ranking. The viciously hot \u201cPepper X\u201d gets the highest.\u00a0 ",

            "To investigate, the team ran a series of taste tests. The first involved 10 types of powdered chili peppers. The researchers mixed different amounts of each powder with tomato juice so each blend contained the same amount of spice-causing compounds. As a result, each mix had the same Scoville rating.",
            "The researchers offered their samples to a panel of people who\u2019d been trained to judge spiciness. Panelists tasted each mix and rated how pungent it was on a scale from zero to 15. A zero rating meant the panelist couldn\u2019t perceive any spice. A 15 meant they \u201ccan\u2019t imagine anything more intense,\u201d Peterson says.",
            "Despite all the samples having the same Scoville rank, some tasted spicier than others, the panel found. Arbol peppers, the least pungent variety, earned an average 7.1 rating. Fatalii peppers, the most pungent type, averaged an 11.8.",

The team fine-tuned the amount of pepper added to each mix so that each had the same Scoville rating. Still, some mixes tasted spicier than others. People thought the blend containing Arbol peppers (left) was least spicy. They thought the blend with Fatalii peppers (right) was spiciest.",
            "Peterson\u2019s group took a closer look at the powdered peppers to see what was going on. They analyzed the peppers\u2019 chemical makeup for compounds linked to pungency.",
            "Five chemicals seemed to make peppers less spicy. All were more abundant in the least spicy pepper than in the spiciest one. \u201cThese molecules are tasteless,\u201d Peterson says. \u201cYet when they interact with taste molecules, they\u2019re suppressing them.\u201d",
            "Another round of taste tests offered more insight into the anti-spice compounds. For this experiment, the team prepped two mixtures. One contained just tomato juice, capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin. The other held tomato juice, those two spice compounds, plus one of the five compounds that were linked to lower spiciness.",
            "The scientists dripped each mixture onto a piece of filter paper. Panelists put both pieces on their tongues, one on the left side and one on the right. This let them see which tasted spicier. In all, 37 panelists did this test for each of the five compounds.",
            "Three of the five compounds took the edge off the mixtures\u2019 spiciness. One called capsianoside I decreased spiciness by 0.7 points on the 15-point scale. Another known as roseoside brought ratings down by 1.2 points. A third called gingerglycoside A soothed spiciness by 1 point.",
            "Peterson\u2019s group also tried using all three anti-spice compounds together. But that didn\u2019t seem to help much. With the combo, spiciness only dropped by 0.7 points.",

            "It\u2019s not clear yet how any of these compounds affect our perceptions of spiciness. They might attach to the same receptors in our mouths that capsaicin does, Peterson says. These receptors let us taste spicy things. If the anti-spice compounds block capsaicin from latching on to the receptors, we might not taste as much spice.",
            "But that\u2019s just one possible explanation, says Jie Zheng. The spice-blocking compounds might bind to a different receptor but still have the same effect. Zheng is a biophysicist at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine. He studies spicy sensations but was not involved in the new study.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s important to know how these compounds work,\u201d Zheng says. \u201cThat would be very informative to guide the applications that people may find.\u201d",

            "Some of these applications might include growing peppers to be more or less spicy, Peterson says. Or the compounds might work in an \u201canti-spice\u201d condiment. If your food is too spicy, you could sprinkle the condiment on your food. That might reduce its heat, Peterson says.",
            "The anti-spice compounds might also work as pain relievers, though this hasn\u2019t been tested yet. Gels containing capsaicin are known to relieve nerve pain. But they can also cause a burning sensation. Adding anti-spice compounds to those gels might allow them to provide relief without the burn, Peterson says."

            "Free oxygen makes up about 21 percent of the air we breathe. The rest is mostly nitrogen with a smattering of other gases. Engineers would want to replicate this blend, says Byrne.",
            "Oxygen-producing microbes could help, says Seager. Research suggests cyanobacteria kicked off a rise in free oxygen in our atmosphere a little over 2 billion years ago. Scientists could tweak the genes of these microbes to help them better withstand Mars\u2019 freezing temps and intense levels of radiation. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Through photosynthesis, these tiny workers could then take in CO2 and pump breathable oxygen into Mars\u2019 atmosphere. And using microbes might offer a safer method of oxygen production than relying on more complex machines. With machines, says Seager, \u201cif one little thing goes wrong, we\u2019re all dead.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Creating a stable atmosphere is only one of many hurdles engineers would face in terraforming Mars. Without a magnetic field to shield it, Mars gets blasted with deadly amounts of radiation from outer space\u200b\u200b\u200b and the sun\u200b. The dusty, pulverized rock covering the planet\u2019s surface contains toxic salts called perchlorates. And since Mars has only about a third of Earth\u2019s gravity, anyone living there would risk their muscles and bones weakening, says Byrne.",
            "Humans can\u2019t reshape Mars with today\u2019s tech. Space agencies around the world are still working toward getting the first astronauts to the Red Planet. NASA aims to achieve this as early as the \u200b\u200b2030s.",
            "That makes it tough to estimate when humans might be able to terraform a planet like Mars, says Byrne. Terraforming tech could take anywhere from a few hundred to several thousands of years to perfect, he says. \u201cCertainly nothing remotely in our time.\u201d",
            "Such tech would have to be reliable enough to protect human lives. Even on Earth, humans can\u2019t survive extremes such as the cold of Antarctica or the intense pressures of our oceans without life support. Small malfunctions to terraforming tech could be catastrophic. \u201cWe\u2019re just so fragile,\u201d says Seager. \u201cThat\u2019s why the whole terraforming question is so challenging.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",

            "All sunglasses will darken a view somewhat, but they may not reduce glare. For that, you\u2019ll need polarizing lenses. And to protect the eyes from the sun\u2019s damaging rays, the lenses will have to be treated even more. ",
            "Bright sunlight can flash off water, glass or metal. The resulting glare will make it hard to see anything clearly. The solution: Put on a pair of sunglasses with polarized lenses.",
            "Regular, tinted sunglasses contain a coating that reduces sunlight\u2019s intense brightness. It\u2019s like putting thin curtains on a window. But to cut the glare, their lenses need more than a tint. They need what\u2019s more like window blinds \u2014 something that lets some light through while blocking the glare.",
            "\u201cPolarized lenses reduce eye strain and improve visibility and contrast,\u201d explains physicist Liliane Ventura. She works at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in Brazil. There, she studies sunglasses and other vision aids.",
            "Special filters in polarized lenses reduce \u201cthe disruptive effects of glare,\u201d she says. That makes \u201coutdoor activities like driving, fishing and skiing safer.\u201d",
            "But an even bigger problem for our vision can be the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) light. Chronic exposure to these rays can lead to permanent eye damage \u2014 such as cataracts and even cancer.",
            "Sunglasses without UV filters may fail to protect our eyes against this damaging light, Ventura\u2019s team has found. Knowing that not all sunglasses are the same, we can look at how these different filters work.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Light travels as a jumble of waves. \u201cThink of sunlight as a bunch of waves vibrating in all possible directions,\u201d Ventura says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call unpolarized light.\u201d When sunlight hits an especially reflective surface, though \u2014 such as water or the hood of a car \u2014 much of the light will reflect in just one direction. Usually, it\u2019s horizontal.",
            "The randomly focused light is known as polarization. Polarized light vibrates in just one direction.",
            "Most reflections from horizontal surfaces polarize light. We experience this as glare. However, reflections are not the only way to polarize light. Certain filters can polarize light, too. And these polarizers explain the glare-diminishing effects of some sunglasses.",
            "\u201cVery clever guys in the past thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we intercept the pathway of polarized light [through the lenses of sunglasses]?\u2019\u201d explains Jos\u00e9 Toschi. An optical engineer, he directs research at Suntech Supplies in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. There, he helps design eyewear, including sunglasses.",
            "*an_illustration_showing_how_polarized_lenses_change_block_horizontal_light_waves",
            "fCPolarized lenses allow vertical light waves (here drawn as light green) to pass through while blocking horizontal light waves (here drawn as orange) \u2014 the ones that cause glare.",
            "This approach applies filters to the lenses. These filters contain molecules lined up next to each other. They create a pattern that resembles a picket fence. \u201cTogether, these molecular lines work [to block out glare],\u201d Toschi says.",
            "Here\u2019s how it works. Imagine passing a rope through an opening between two pickets in a fence. Tie one end to a tree. On the other side of the fence, move the free end of the rope up and down. The vertical waves that this creates in the rope can slide through the opening of the fence. Wave the rope from left to right, however, and the waves will become horizontal \u2014 and won\u2019t pass through the fence. The direction of the waves no longer aligns with the openings between the pickets.",
            "This is exactly what happens with polarized sunglasses. The filter\u2019s tiny molecular lines act like the pickets in the fence. When light waves try to pass through the glasses\u2019 lines, only the vertical waves make it through. All horizontal waves \u2014 the glare \u2014 get blocked out.",
            "With that glare now removed, colors appear more vivid and everything looks clearer. The same will not happen with sunglasses that are merely tinted. Their lenses simply reduce how much overall light reaches your eyes.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/1Z6rXEl2agk?feature=oembed",
            "Without polarized sunglasses, we\u2019re unable to see the crocodile hiding in the water; it becomes visible when the water is viewed through polarized sunglasses.",
            "If you\u2019re uncertain whether your tinted sunglasses are polarized, take this simple test.",
            "Look at a screen \u2014 such as the one on a smart phone \u2014 while wearing the glasses. As you tilt your head or the phone, the screen\u2019s color might change or even darken. If it does, congratulations: You\u2019re wearing polarized lenses.",
            "This works because the lens\u2019 filter is \u201cblocking some of the light,\u201d explains Ventura. And how much it blocks will change as you tilt the phone\u2019s screen.",
            "However, Toschi notes, polarizing lenses alone aren\u2019t enough to protect our eyes. The sun\u2019s UV rays can lead to more than short-term discomfort.",
            "For instance, one study in rabbits found that repeated exposure of their eyes\u2019 cornea \u2014 the clear, outermost layer \u2014 to UV rays reduces the amount of antioxidant enzymes. The paper cautions, this \u201cvery probably contributes to the damage of the cornea (and possibly also deeper parts of the eye)\u201d due to highly reactive oxidants.",
            "Protective lenses should also filter out UV light. And that\u2019s not one wavelength but a spectrum of them. They fall into two bands of light known as UV-A and UV-B.",
            "\u201c[Good] lenses should be able to block the whole spectrum,\u201d Toschi says. \u201cSo, when one buys sunglasses, one should demand the UV400 certificate from the vendor.\u201d It confirms that these glasses contain a coating that blocks the entire UV-A and UV-B spectrum \u2014 wavelengths that span from 280 to 400 nanometers.",

Not-so-fun fact: Up to 10 percent of skin cancers occur on eyelids \u2014 yet another reason to wear protective glasses. Learn which types of eyewear protect best.",
            "Sunglasses have been used for centuries. But as new technology emerges, so do new designs.",
            "For instance, not all light passes through sunglasses\u2019 lenses on its way to your eyes. Some can come around the sides, Ventura notes. Some glasses are now being designed to prevent sunlight from entering through frame edges.",
            "\u201cBut the research that excites me the most on polarized lenses is nanocoatings,\u201d Ventura says. \u201cThese use ultra-thin layers that block glare, UV, fog and reflections all at once.\u201d",
            "Some of these new lenses are even being sold as \u201csmart.\u201d They can adjust their polarization, for instance, so you get less glare when you\u2019re outdoors but more light when you\u2019re indoors.",

The way that a shape is described in geometry is with a\u00a0formula, which is simply a mathematical way to calculate different properties of a shape like size, area or volume.\u00a0Volume\u00a0is a unique property of three-dimensional shapes, because three-dimensional shapes take up space in three different directions. Most real-world objects are three dimensional: balls, cars, food, etc.",

A sphere is an \u201cideal\u201d three-dimensional shape that is perfectly circular in all directions. Even though a ball is spherical in shape, it is not a perfect sphere. If geometric formulas describe \u201cideal\u201d shapes and not \u201creal\u201d shapes, then how are they useful in the \u201creal\u201d world?",
            "Most real-world shapes are not simple shapes and use complex geometry to be calculated. The properties of real-world shapes can also be approximated, or estimated, to the best possible measure with a geometric formula. This is called making a geometric\u00a0model, and the most important part of making a good geometric model is choosing the formula that best describes the object. Even the most irregular objects can be modeled by using geometry: cars, airplanes, electronics, plastics, food, etc. Geometric modeling is very important for manufacturing because a product needs to have the same shape, made the same way, every time.",

            "Cats come in many colors and patterns. And bright orange is one of the most striking. The mystery of what gene gives ginger cats their hue has stumped scientists for decades. Now, two different teams have just turned up the same solution.",

Even multicolored cats with a few ginger patches \u2014 such as calicos and tortoiseshells \u2014 have this mutation. The DNA deletion makes cells in cats\u2019 hair-growing structures produce a yellow-red pigment instead of the default brown-black hue.",
            "Both teams published their studies in the June 23 issue of Current Biology.",

            "In cats and most other mammals, males usually have one X and one Y chromosome. Females typically have two X chromosomes. As a result, the single X chromosome is very active in all cells of a male cat. But only one of the two X chromosomes is active in each cell of a female cat.",
            "If the ginger fur gene were on the X chromosome, then male cats with that trait would be completely orange. But in a female cat, both X chromosomes would need to carry the orange trait for her to be fully ginger. If only one X chromosome contained the trait, then her coat would likely become a patchwork of orange and black.",
            "Indeed, that is the color pattern seen among cats. Most completely orange cats are male. Most multicolored cats, meanwhile, are female.",
            "Most other mammal species don\u2019t get ginger hair based on their sex. Not even famously orange big cats (such as tigers) do. So domestic cats possess an unusual mutation, says Chris Kaelin. He studies genetics at Stanford University in California.",

Their work revealed a deleted stretch of about 5,000 DNA base pairs near a gene called Arhgap36. (The cat genome has about 2.7 billion base pairs total.) The removed bit was not in the gene itself, but close enough to affect its activity.",
            "Scientists have discovered that a single genetic mutation is behind what makes orange cats orange. It was already known that the gene for orange fur sits on the X chromosome. Since male cats have just one X, they only need a single copy of the gene to be fully orange. Female cats have two X chromosomes, so they\u2019d need the gene on both to be completely orange. Otherwise, they usually end up with a patchwork of orange and black fur. A new study reveals that a DNA deletion causes pigment cells to produce the orange color. #CatsofTikTok #OrangeCat #Science",
            "The Arhgap36 gene carries instructions for making a certain protein. The nearby deletion boosted how much of that protein it makes \u2014 but only in cells that make pigment. (Pigments are chemicals that impart color.)",
            "In pigment-making cells, the protein stops genes needed to make the brown-black pigment from turning on. Instead, a yellow-red pigment is produced. It involves fewer genes, so it\u2019s easier to make, explains Greg Barsh. He\u2019s also a geneticist at Stanford University. (Mammals produce only two pigments. Different shades come from other genetic factors.)",
            "A team in Japan identified the same deletion. This team examined DNA from almost 60 cats. When lots of Arhgap36 protein is made, the genes that make the brown-black pigment become less active, explains Hiroyuki Sasaki. He\u2019s a geneticist at Kyushu University.",
            "His team also found that all orange cats from a global database of 258 kitties had the same deletion. Non-orange ones lacked it. Sasaki suspects the trait was passed down from one ancestral cat. That cat lived more than 900 years ago, suggest Kaelin, Barsh and their team-mates. They base this estimate on historical paintings of calicos.",
            "Before these studies, researchers didn\u2019t know Arhgap36 was involved with a cat\u2019s coloring. It\u2019s mostly active in certain hormone-producing organs, such as the pituitary gland. The gene\u2019s role in ginger hues is unique to domesticated felines."

            "The eight bright stars forming a teapot-like configuration (as seen in this photograph) are part of the constellation Sagittarius. Thousands of light-years beyond them lurks the first lone black hole ever detected. From mid-northern latitudes, Sagittarius appears in the southern sky during summer and early fall.",
            "For the first time, astronomers have confirmed the existence of a lone black hole. This rogue is wandering around the Milky Way \u2014 our galaxy \u2014 with no companion star.",
            "It\u2019s \u201cthe only [loner] so far,\u201d says Kailash Sahu. He\u2019s an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md.",
            "In 2022, Sahu was part of a team that found the dark object moving through the constellation Sagittarius. (This group of stars in the southern sky takes its name from the Latin for \u201carcher.\u201d)",
            "At the time, this discovery made headlines. The reason: Until then, all known black holes had a companion star. Those companions had pointed to the presence of the black holes (which can\u2019t be seen because they emit no light).",
            "A second team would go on to dispute the claim that this rogue was a black hole. They argued it could be a neutron star.",
            "But new observations by the Hubble Space Telescope now confirm the rogue object is about seven times as massive as the sun. That\u2019s so massive that the dark object is a black hole. Black holes are more than three times as massive as the sun. Neutron stars, though, have less mass than this. So the dark object must be a black hole, Sahu\u2019s group reasoned.",
            "The team shared that finding in the April 20 issue of The Astrophysical Journal.",
            "Solitary black holes should be common. But since they don\u2019t normally affect visible stars, they\u2019re hard to find. The lone black hole in Sagittarius revealed itself only because it passed in front of a dim background star.",
            "During that passage in July 2011, the black hole\u2019s intense gravity magnified the star\u2019s light through what\u2019s known as gravitational lensing. This lensing slowly shifted the star\u2019s apparent position, too.",
            "That star\u2019s position still hasn\u2019t settled down. This shows why \u201cit takes a long time to do the observations,\u201d Sahu says.",
            "The rogue\u2019s original discovery relied on Hubble\u2019s precise measurements of star positions from 2011 to 2017. The new study adds in Hubble data from 2021 and 2022. It also uses data collected by the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia spacecraft.",
            "What these data now show: The black hole is 7.1 times as massive as the sun (give or take 0.8 solar mass).",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "And that research team of doubters? They revised their assessment in 2023. They now agree the object is a black hole. That team estimates the object\u2019s mass may be only six times that of the sun. But because this team is not as certain of the black hole\u2019s mass as Sahu\u2019s group, the two results are considered consistent.",
            "Located 5,000 light-years from Earth, the newfound rogue is much closer than the supermassive black hole at our Milky Way\u2019s center. That central black hole also lies in Sagittarius. It\u2019s also more than five times farther from us.",
            "The star-rich region around the galactic center offers a great hunting ground for other rogue black holes passing in front of stars. Sahu hopes to find additional such loners by using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. It\u2019s due to launch in 2027."

Some people have said that Venus is \u201cgeologically dead,\u201d she says. But over the past few years, growing evidence\u00a0has hinted that Venus is geologically active. The new work shows that hot material under the coronae is \u201clikely driving tectonic processes that are not so different than what occurs on the Earth.\u201d",

            "G\u00fclcher and her co-workers first made a computer model of the planet\u2019s crust. A mantle is a thick layer that can separate a planet\u2019s crust from its core. This new model showed how the crust would deform if hot plumes of material rose up from the mantle on Venus. This allowed the team to predict what the plumes and resulting coronae should look like.",
            "Then the scientists looked at the landscapes of Venus and its gravity.",
            "NASA\u2019s Magellan spacecraft had collected those observations in the early 1990s. Its gravity data were key. They revealed that the density of material below the surface differed at various spots. Those variations were linked to plumes seen rising from below.",
            "Comparing the model\u2019s outputs to these satellite data allowed the team to identify plumes beneath 52 coronae.",
            "The model also suggested that these plumes had been sculpting the coronae in various ways \u2014 such as subduction. That\u2019s a process that occurs on Earth. It happens when two solid pieces of Earth\u2019s surface \u2014 tectonic plates \u2014 collide. The force behind that pushes the edge of one plate under the edge of the other.",
            "Venus\u2019 surface isn\u2019t broken up into plates as Earth\u2019s is. But subduction may still occur there. It could take place along the edges of the coronae, G\u00fclcher\u2019s group says.",
            "For instance, as a column of material rises beneath a disk of crust, it also may bulge out to the sides. That would push on the crust around the disk. If the crust is fairly strong, that surrounding crust may bend and dive down \u2014 or subduct \u2014 under the disk.",
            "Earth\u2019s subduction zones host the\u00a0world\u2019s largest quakes. So if there are quakes on Venus, the strongest ones likely jolt at the rims of coronae, G\u00fclcher says.",
            "But the crust around coronae might instead be weak. Then an upward push of material from the mantle might crack the surrounding crust. That detached crust could drip into the planet\u2019s mantle, G\u00fclcher says, \u201clike honey.\u201d",
            "Some coronae may even form as rising plumes get lodged in the ground below the surface. That would make the crust above swell into a round landform. Think of it as a tectonic blister, says Paul Byrne. This planetary scientist works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. He did work on the new study.",

That could be a boon to future Venus missions. The upcoming VERITAS spacecraft, for instance, will gather much more detailed data than Magellan did.",
            "If Venus is geologically active today, perhaps it could have been\u00a0Earthlike in the past, G\u00fclcher says. It makes one wonder, she says: \u201cWas there a period in Venus\u2019 history that was \u2026 potentially less hot and more habitable?\u201d"

And sometimes it\u2019s a lot of pressure. Like when you\u2019re running or scared. When this happens, what protects your blood vessels against bursting? A new study shows how they cope: Vessel cells morph their structures on a super tiny level.",
            "\u201cWe wanted to understand,\u201d says Claire Dessalles, \u201chow does the tissue respond to external forces?\u201d The pressures of day-to-day life make these shifts happen in vessels all the time, she notes. So it\u2019s important for us to know how and why.",
            "A physicist, Dessalles works at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. The changes her team witnessed in cells lining blood vessels seem to keep those vessels from bursting whenever our blood pressure suddenly rises.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "What the cells do, her team reports, is flex and structurally adapt with a \u201cfluid-like expansion.\u201d At the same time, tiny thread-like proteins in cells lining those vessels reorganize dramatically.\u00a0",
            "Dessalles and her colleagues shared all this in the June issue of Nature Physics.",

            "If all your blood vessels were laid out end to end, they\u2019d be long enough to circle the globe \u2014 more than once!",
            "The new findings did not come from tests on vessels in an intact, human body. Instead, scientists built a tiny artificial blood vessel in a dish. They lined this vessel, just 120 micrometers (0.0047 inch) wide, with human cells. As in the human body, this inner layer was thin \u2014 just one cell thick. The formal name for this layer is the vessel\u2019s endothelium (En-doh-THEE-lee-um).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The cells in that lining contain thin strands of a muscle protein. Called actin, this protein can contract or relax. It\u2019s like how muscles tighten when you need to exert force. In our body, the flow of blood puts pressure against vessel walls.",
            "Using a syringe pump \u2014 \u00a0a device that pushes fluid through a tube \u2014 to mimic the flow of blood, Dessalles\u2019 team increased pressure on its vessel-in-a-dish. \u201cWe just decided to blow up a vessel like a balloon and see what happens,\u201d Dessalles says.",

            "Before the pressure, the actin ran along the length of the vessel. It looked like train tracks, but more spread out. After pressure was applied, the proteins now wrapped around the inside of the vessel.",
            "Next, the team removed the actin from the cells and ran the experiment again. Without actin, the tissue became much softer. Now, it couldn\u2019t handle pressure well. Actin is important for making blood vessels strong, Dessalles concludes. Without it, the cells can\u2019t adapt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Most past studies stretched cell layers in a flat, 2-D sheet, Clyne notes. This one instead applied real pressure to a 3-D tube. \u201cThat was very interesting,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause cells behave very differently in 3-D than in 2-D.\u201d",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",

This odd in-between state helps explain how cells in blood vessels can shift smoothly while keeping some internal structure. It\u2019s why scientists now describe this blood vessel expansion as fluid-like.",
            "This action also mirrors what others have seen in real animals, Dessalles says. In zebrafish, for instance, \u201cwhen the heart starts to beat, you see the same [brief] response.\u201d Seeing this similar action, she says, \u201cwas very exciting for us.\u201d",

            "One clue is that mosquitoes are able to taste the surfaces on which they land, Baik\u2019s team finds. In fact, sweat may play a big role in whether they bite. Human sweat contains water, salt and amino acids (the building blocks of proteins).",

She prefers \u201corganic products over synthetic ones.\u201d That led this sophomore at Garden City High School in New York to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in my sunscreen?\u201d",
            "These products protect our skin against blistering solar rays. But their use comes at a price. Some of sunscreen\u2019s chemicals may cause cancer, Taylor notes. And when these chemicals wash into our environment, they can hurt animals. For example, some mineral sunscreens interfere with the ability of freshwater animals to navigate. High enough exposures, she says, can kill some organisms.",

            "Bananas tend to grow in a \u201cUV-intense environment,\u201d Taylor says. UV \u2014 short for ultraviolet \u2014 is a band of light wavelengths. This high-energy light is invisible to the human eye. But it causes most of the sun\u2019s damage to our skin. For a sunscreen to work, it must protect against certain UV rays.",
            "Taylor had reasoned that bananas \u201cmust have their own mechanism.\u201d After all, they grow near the equator. That\u2019s where UV exposures are strongest.",
            "Plants typically make flavonoids \u2014 pigments that come in a rainbow of colors \u2014 as a defense against the sun\u2019s UV. Taylor wondered if banana flavonoids might work to protect our skin from UV, too.",
            "She wasn\u2019t sure exactly which bananas flavonoids to use. Taylor heated, froze and blended the outer layer of a banana peel. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s exposed to the sunlight,\u201d she explains. Any UV-filtering chemicals likely lie there.",
            "Breaking open the cells released many of their chemicals. From this soup she made two extracts. One of these contained only components that would dissolve in water. That was her aqueous extract. The other contained only chemicals that wouldn\u2019t dissolve in water. That was her nonpolar extract. Nonpolar chemicals dissolve in oil rather than water.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A sunscreen must absorb UV light before it reaches your skin. And the more it absorbs, the better. To test how well each extract could do that, Taylor turned to a light-measuring tool. Called a spectrophotometer, it measures how much of any color of light a liquid absorbs.",
            "The tool confirmed that both of her banana extracts absorbed UV light. But the nonpolar one went a step further. It absorbed the full range of UV wavelengths \u2014 and especially the most damaging ones. They belong to a part of the UV spectrum called UV-A.",
            "Would banana-based sunscreens also be safe for the environment? After all, Taylor says, typical drug-store sunscreens can harm aquatic life. To find out, she recruited planarians (Girardia tigrina) as her \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d Planarians are a type of flatworm that live in water. They\u2019re often used in drug-safety studies, Taylor explains. A chemical that harms these worms might also pose a risk to other aquatic animals.",

She also used a microscope to observe planarians\u2019 locomotion \u2014 or movement \u2014 when exposed to UV light.",
            "The plan was to put planarians into dishes with different extracts and expose them to strong UV light for 10 minutes.

Her five test solutions included her two extracts, a drugstore sunscreen solution, plain water and glycerol.",

            "The three glycerol-exposed groups exhibited the most damage. The aqueous extract group showed the least. Where damage did show up, Taylor says, it looked \u201cspotty.\u201d That probably means a worm \u201cwas not fully coated.\u201d",
            "The next step is figuring out exactly what chemical provided the aqueous extract\u2019s UV protection. Identifying that, she says, could allow for a new class of eco-friendly, banana-based sunscreens.",

In 2020, Salto\u2019s developers figured out how to make Salto stick a landing on flat surfaces. For the new work, they made two big changes. They added a clawlike gripper to Salto\u2019s foot. Now it can catch a pipe during landings. They also gave Salto the ability to stand or crouch. This can help improve its balance.",

            "In test jumps in the lab, Salto leapt from one plastic pipe to another. It successfully did this 25 times out of 30. It caught the tube, swinging over or under it most of the time. But in two trials, Salto leapt, landed and perched just perfectly. It stuck a balanced upright hold on the pipe.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of room for improvement,\u201d Yim says. Salto may not be ready to join that circus group Cirque du Soleil yet. Still, Yim has ideas about how to improve the robot\u2019s balance. They could improve Salto\u2019s gripper, for a better grasp when trying to land on a pipe. That would work like a squirrel squeezing a branch with its toes.",
            "Yim envisions future robots that are even more agile than Salto. To help with construction, for instance, they might one day hop onto pipes or beams while carrying cameras for inspection. Or maybe Salto could leap throughout a forest as an environmental monitor.",
            "But Salto will need many more tweaks to catch up to its bushy-tailed brothers, Yim says. \u201cThe robot is definitely not able to do what a squirrel can do just yet.\u201d"

            "When rain or snow falls, much of it seeps into the soil. From there it flows down through porous rock, gravel and sand, forming underground streams. This groundwater will sometimes travel long distances. Scientists have now attempted to calculate its path in North America. Their findings suggest water can travel below ground much farther and deeper \u2014 and for a much longer time \u2014 than had been expected.",
            "For instance, some groundwater can travel up to 238 kilometers (148 miles), the new study reports. And it can seep to depths of more than 90 meters (300 feet).",
            "Or consider the deep groundwater pumped up for drinking. Most was believed to be separate from polluted water that often resurfaces in streams and rivers. But through long, buried treks, groundwater can link areas thought to be separate \u2014 sharing pollution it picked up along the way.\u00a0",
            "All that water now appears \u201ca lot more connected,\u201d says Reed Maxwell, an author of the new study. He works at Princeton University in New Jersey. As a hydrologist, he studies the movement of water.",
            "His team shared its findings on how water moves in the January 6 issue of Nature Water.",
            "Understanding these connections between water sources, they say, is important. It could help water managers work together to make better decisions about how to use water for drinking, irrigating crops and supporting ecosystems.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A watershed (also known as a catchment) is the broad expanse of land that funnels snowmelt and rain downhill to a body of open water (such as a lake or ocean). Some rain and snowmelt will remain above ground. But much will seep underground as it moves.",
            "Water managers decide who gets to use the water within a watershed and how. Watersheds are managed separately. But water can flow freely underground across watershed boundaries, says Laura Condon. She\u2019s a hydrologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\u00a0",
            "If watersheds are connected, then problems in one might affect another, says Maxwell. This got him thinking: \u201cIf you dump pollution in one watershed, does it get to another?\u201d\u00a0",
            "Others had mapped groundwater flows in various parts of the United States. But how distant sources of underground water might be connected hadn\u2019t been clear. That was one motivation for this study, says Maxwell. Understanding how water moves across a continent underground can help show how, when and where impacts to that water may occur.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Maxwell and Condon\u2019s team decided to track groundwater\u2019s flow beneath most of continental North America. They started with where this water reemerges in streams. Then, working backward, they figured out where it must have first seeped into the Earth.",
            "To do this, they built a computer model. It simulated North America\u2019s underground layers of rock to depths of 392 meters (1,200 feet). Next, they divided the continent into little blocks. Each was one kilometer long by one kilometer wide.",
            "Then they asked the model to calculate how much water would likely flow through each block. That would depend on the shape and thickness of Earth\u2019s underground layers and the space between the rocks.",
            "Each block is like a Lego brick, Maxwell says. Once they calculated water\u2019s flow in each one, they stacked them together \u2014 85 million of them.",
            "Then they added simulated water droplets to the computer model. The model \u201cpushes\u201d these droplets around based on how water would flow through the layers of below ground rock. And the scientists tracked everywhere they would go.",
            "\u201cThink of a video game: Where would the little ball go? It\u2019ll be pushed by the velocity this way,\u201d says Condon. \u00a0Then, \u201cwhere would it go next?\u201d",
            "Water often travels more than 97 kilometers (60 miles), the model showed. That wouldn\u2019t be far if water was streaming across the surface, says Maxwell. But it was far longer than it had been expected to flow below ground.",
            "Most water stays below the surface for five to 10 years, the model found. But buried aquifers (underground layers of water-filled rock) also exist. Water can collect in them for 100,000 to 1 million years.",

            "Rain and snow seep into the Earth, forming streams of groundwater that travel long distances below the surface.",
            "Knowing how far water travels and for how long helps determine impacts to water. How? \u201cIf you have pollution underground, you need to understand where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Maxwell explains.",
            "Consider, for instance, the nitrate fertilizers that farmers apply to soils. In large amounts, nitrates can harm people and aquatic life. Rain can wash these chemicals into groundwater. From there, they can potentially travel far from the farms on which they had been used. That can pollute water once thought to be free of such chemicals.",
            "Models might also point to where water being pumped from the ground at one site (for drinking or irrigation) had been on its way to hydrate a distant wetland. Knowing this, says Claudia Faunt, managers might then make sure they leave enough water in the ground to sustain that wetland \u2014 and the ecosystem it supports. Faunt didn\u2019t take part in the new study. But as a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in San Diego, Calif., she understands these issues.\u00a0",
            "\u201cEverything\u2019s connected,\u201d Maxwell says. By knowing how one watershed may be linked to others, you can understand how the system works as a whole, he explains. And that could be key to managing Earth\u2019s life-giving resource. \u00a0"

The new experiments, she says, do a good job showing that the sugar-craving circuit exists in both mice and us.",

            "Min\u00e8re believes there\u2019s a reason brain why our brains crave sugar, even when we\u2019re full. Our ancient ancestors evolved in a time when it was tougher to find food, she says. And sweet foods typically provide lots of quick energy.",
            "\u201cImagine you had a bunch of carrots and a bit of meat and you\u2019re completely full. But then you find beautiful fruit and a bit of honey,\u201d says Min\u00e8re. In the past, even if you didn\u2019t want to eat more carrots or meat, you might have still wanted to eat the fruit and honey for all of the energy it holds, she says \u2014 energy you could store for later.",
            "So, Min\u00e8re says, it\u2019s not your fault if you can\u2019t resist the lure of a sweet treat. Blame biology."

            "Parrots are natural chatterboxes. Small parrots known both as parakeets and as budgerigars make this chatter in ways remarkably similar to the way we do it.",
            "Researchers shared the new finding March 19 in Nature.\u00a0",
            "Parakeets have special brain areas for making language. These language centers work much as those in humans do. So far, these parrots are the only animals other than people known to have brains that work in this way, says Michael Long in New York City. A neuroscientist, he works at New York University Langone Health.",
            "This \u201cis really the first nonhuman animal in which that has been shown,\u201d Long says.",
            "Parakeets (Melopsittacus undulatus) are tropical-colored cutie pies. Beyond their looks, these parrots are smart and outgoing. Their social life makes them interesting research subjects for language studies.",
            "Learning how their brains create speech might also help researchers better understand some language disorders in people.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/6cqOI4ezWhk?feature=oembed",
            "Parakeets have complex conversations, perhaps using the \u201cvocal keyboard\u201d in their brains.",
            "Long and Zetian Yang recorded the activity of individual nerve cells in the brains of four parakeets. These cells were nestled in the anterior arcopallium. It sits in a front part of the birds\u2019 brains. The two NYU Langone researchers tracked the activity of cells here as the birds chirped and trilled away. That activity was tied to how the birds made those sounds, they found.",
            "How the activity was organized turns out to be pretty simple, Long says. He compares it to a keyboard. This keyboard can produce a range of sounds \u2014 consonants, vowels, high pitches and low pitches. A parakeet can combine different sounds \u201cby just playing this vocal keyboard,\u201d Long says.",
            "Overall, this brain system is organized in a rather humanlike way.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Similarities between human and parrot brains show how two species can solve a problem in a similar way. This could be \u201ca very tidy example\u201d of what\u2019s known as convergent evolution, Long says. The brains of people and these small parrots both developed ways that let them make a complex series of sounds. But how this happened evolved separately in each species.",
            "Scientists now know more about how the birds\u2019 brains help these parrots talk. But another question remains: What are these birds talking about?",
            "\u201cWe are trying now to translate budgie,\u201d he says of that language.",
            "Long\u2019s team is using advanced machine learning to find patterns among the bird talk. They hope this will help them figure out what each warble and chirp means. Perhaps their language \u2014 not just how the birds\u2019 brains create it \u2014 resembles that in people.",
            "Through these kinds of experiments, Long says, people may come to challenge the idea that complex language is a particularly human behavior. Parakeets might be telling us that people aren\u2019t the sole species with a gift of gab.",

            "Physicists could forge tauonium (upper left) using a particle collider that slams electrons (arrows at right) into positrons (arrows at left).",
            "Tauonium is a type of atom that scientists suspect may exist but have not yet spotted. Unlike typical atoms, it would lack protons, neutrons and electrons.",
            "Atoms usually consist of electrons and a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons. (The one exception to this is the hydrogen atom, which has no neutrons). Electrons carry a negative charge. Protons carry a positive charge.",
            "Positive and negative charges attract each other. That force holds a typical atom together. Another force, called strong force, bundles neutrons and protons in a nucleus.",
            "Like a typical atom, tauonium would be made of smaller particles. But it would not have protons and elections. Instead, tauonium would contain particles called tau and anti-tau. A tau is similar to an electron and carries a negative charge. An anti-tau carries a positive charge. Just like in a typical atom, attraction between opposite charges would hold tauonium together. But unlike other atoms, it would not have strong force.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Why do scientists suspect tauonium might exist? Something similar was seen decades ago. In the 1950s, researchers discovered positronium. This is a type of atom that lacks protons and neutrons. It is made of an electron and a positron. Think of a positron as a positively charged electron. A positron is to an electron what an anti-tau is to a tau. Like tauonium, the pull between opposite charges binds this atom together.",
            "Scientists haven\u2019t yet found tauonium. To search for it, they plan to smash particles together that produce tau particles. They hope the process will also produce tauonium.",
            "If it works, they expect the atom to be short-lived. Based on what they know of similar particles, scientists predict that the particles tau and anti-tau will collide. This collision would occur almost at once. And it would destroy the atom an instant after it formed.",
            "Searching for particles as strange as tauonium might sound like fantasy. But this work helps scientists study matter at the tiniest scales.",
            "Scientists have proposed a method for hunting down tauonium atoms.",
