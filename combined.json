            "A genome is an organism\u2019s complete set of genetic instructions.",
            "For most living things, genetic instructions come in the form of DNA. This molecule contains the instructions to build and maintain living things. In most living things, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes. Some of the DNA in a chromosome consists of genes. These are segments of DNA that carry instructions for making an organism\u2019s proteins (and a few other molecules).",
            "But genes only make up a fraction of an organism\u2019s genome. Most of the genome is made of non-coding DNA. Non-coding DNA doesn\u2019t contain genes. Scientists once called it \u201cjunk DNA.\u201d That\u2019s because it was believed to have no function. But it turns out that non-coding DNA helps the organism in other ways, such as allowing a cell to use and read the code in its genes.",
            "Most human cells carry one entire genome \u2014 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs. But exceptions exist. Red blood cells are one example. Once mature, red blood cells lack DNA altogether. Egg and sperm cells also do not contain a full genome. These cells carry half a genome \u2014 in humans, that\u2019s 23 chromosomes each. When an egg cell and a sperm cell fuse, they create one new cell with a full genome of 46 chromosomes. A complete human genome contains about 25,000 genes and many non-coding regions.",
            "Some viruses use RNA as their genetic material instead of DNA. Viruses are not alive in the same way as a cell. However, we still refer to their complete RNA instructions as a genome.",
            "Genetic material \u2014 both DNA and RNA \u2014 is made of units called nucleotides. They are represented by the letters A, T, G and C (RNA replaces T with U). DNA\u2019s nucleotides occur in pairs, called base pairs. A human genome consists of about 3 billion of these base pairs. Combinations of these base pairs provide all the instructions for building a living thing.",
            "Genome size varies from one species to another. For example, the Japanese canopy plant\u2019s (Paris japonica) genome is about 50 times bigger than a human\u2019s. A complete set of this plant\u2019s DNA consists of 149 billion base pairs. If we stretched out the DNA from one cell, it would extend about 100 meters (330 feet). In contrast, a human genome would extend only about 2 meters (6.5 feet).",
            "On the other hand, the single-celled green algae called Ostreococcus tauri has a very short genome. It contains only about 12.6 million base pairs. Its DNA \u2014 if stretched out \u2014 would extend only about 8 millimeters (0.3 inch).",

            "Red adzuki beans are a beloved staple in East Asia. Cooks tuck a sweet paste made from them inside mochi, swirl it into mooncakes and layer it beneath custard in taiyaki. But despite its popularity, which people were the first to start using this bean remained murky \u2014 until now.\u00a0",
            "Scientists have analyzed the DNA of nearly 700 varieties of adzuki across Asia. Some of these plants grow in the wild. People have been farming \u2014 or cultivating \u2014 other types. The beans\u2019 genes now suggest that adzuki was first cultivated in Japan between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago. Only later did people start growing a wide variety of these red beans in China.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The investigation also uncovered DNA tweaks, or mutations, that gave rise to the beans\u2019 rich red hue.\u00a0",
            "\u201cI was surprised by basically everything,\u201d says Cheng-Ruei Lee. He studies evolutionary genetics at National Taiwan University in Taipei. That field of science looks at how variations in DNA lead organisms to evolve new traits. Lee is part of a team that shared its new findings May 29 in\u202fScience.\u00a0",
            "Adzuki beans grow in pods on bushy plants. They have a naturally sweet, nutty flavor. Fossils of ancient beans hinted that Japan\u2019s Jomon people might have grown adzuki. The Jomon were hunter-gatherers who lived as early as 16,000 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But red bean DNA had pointed to a different origin story. Beans from China show a wider variety in their DNA than those in Japan. Such diversity is typically only seen in plants that people started to cultivate a very long time ago.\u00a0",

            "A plant\u2019s nuclear genome is made up of the DNA tucked inside the nuclei of its cells. Plants inherit their nuclear DNA from both parents. And red beans grown in China do show the most diversity in their nuclear genomes, Lee\u2019s team found.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But the team found another important clue in a different source of the bean\u2019s DNA. This DNA is tucked in structures within plant cells known as chloroplasts. In red beans, only female plants pass this DNA to their offspring. And this type of DNA evolves more slowly. That chloroplast DNA in Chinese red beans closely matches what\u2019s found in wild Japanese beans.\u00a0",
            "There\u2019s only one way that these pieces of evidence can fit together, Lee says. People first started growing red beans in Japan, and the practice later spread to China. There, people cross-bred Japanese red beans with local, wild Chinese red beans.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Today, Chinese red beans now show a much wider variety in their DNA. But their chloroplasts still hold traces of their ancient Japanese ancestors.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Red bean paste is a common filling for East Asian pastries, such as this taiyaki from Japan (left) and these sesame balls from China (right). But where in Asia these beans were first cultivated had been a long-debated topic.",

            "Through farming, adzuki beans also got a makeover. Wild beans are pale with dark mottled spots. The farmed varieties are red all over.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Lee\u2019s team found one mutation in beans\u2019 DNA that affects how they process pigment. It allows red pigments to spread across the coats of their seeds. The deletion of another gene, or chunk of DNA, gets rid of the mottled pattern that\u2019s still seen in the wild.\u00a0",
            "The researchers tracked how those two mutations emerged over time. They also looked at a third mutation seen in the farmed beans. It\u2019s in a gene that reduces the odds that a bean pod will break open. For farmers who want to easily harvest whole beans, that\u2019s a useful trait. But it\u2019s not very helpful for wild plants, which rely on their pods bursting to spread seeds.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "All three mutations seen in farmed beans began to spread around 10,000 years ago. That was long before people started farming the plants in Japan.\u00a0",
            "Since these traits are of little help in the wild, Lee says, their early spread may reflect human preferences. Red has long been considered lucky. What\u2019s more, the Jomon people are known to have used red coloring in their pottery.\u00a0",
            "The new findings bolster the idea that the Jomon people were more than foragers. They could have been shaping their perfect red bean, eventually domesticating it between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago. Fossils had already offered some evidence for that, Lee notes. Finally, he notes, there \u201cis evidence from plant genetics, too.\u201d\u00a0",

It captures the vibrational motion of a biological object \u2014 such as a virus \u2014 based on its \u201csound.\u201d ",
            "What do viruses sound like? Scientists recently found out. They developed a way to eavesdrop on these and other microbes. This new tech can help scientists study such microbes and sound out the identity of germs in our environment.",
            "For hundreds of years, we\u2019ve been able to see cells through microscopes. As these spyglasses have gotten more powerful, they\u2019ve been able to zoom in on smaller and smaller details. Yet even when you can see individual microbes, most look pretty similar.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not a needle in a haystack problem,\u201d says Elad Harel. \u201cIt\u2019s a needle in a stack of needles problem.\u201d This chemist works at Michigan State University (MSU) in East Lansing. \u201cTo detect one needle from all these other needles,\u201d he says, \u201cyou have to look for something that\u2019s unique about it.\u201d",
            "That unique feature could be a sound. Nearly anything can make sound by vibrating \u2014 and typically those vibrations get transmitted to our ears through the air. Different things will make distinctive sounds, depending on their shape and what they\u2019re made of. This is why knocking on a table sounds different from tapping on a window.",
            "The same is true for microbes. Each type has its own special makeup of proteins and other molecules. Their unique chemistry and structures give each microbe a characteristic sound.",
            "That\u2019s what led Harel and his MSU team to begin working on their new laser-based system. By figuring out how to measure these sounds, they\u2019re now able to catalog them. It\u2019s much like seeing a distant bird in the woods but not being sure what type of bird it is until you learn its distinctive call.",

            "Those speedy taps set the virus vibrating. The triggered sound waves are far too quiet for our ears to pick up. So Harel\u2019s team measures them with a second laser. The vibrations cause the second laser\u2019s beam to quiver like a very sensitive eardrum. The scientists measure these signals to \u201chear\u201d the virus.",
            "Other ways of studying microbes, such as viewing them through a microscope, often involve fixing them in place. That makes studying how microbes move a major challenge, notes Kim Davis. A microbiologist, she works at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Md. Usually, what researchers can see is a \u201csnapshot of what is occurring at [one] moment in time,\u201d she says.",
            "With this new tech, scientists may be able to collect data that are less like a freeze-frame and more like a movie of microbes in the environment.",
            "By using sound, \u201cwe showed that we can track single viruses and even listen to a virus rupture,\u201d Harel says. As a virus starts to break open, he says, the frequency of its sound begins to drop \u2014 \u201calmost like a deflating balloon.\u201d",

            "But, notes Davis, \u201cIt can be very difficult to determine if an organism has pathogenic [illness-provoking] properties just from looking at it.\u201d",
            "With something like the new system, we might one day be able to hear the difference, Harel says.",
            "There\u2019s still a lot to learn about these viral sounds, though. The sound a microbe makes might change if it\u2019s on a surface versus in the air (much like how our voices change when we\u2019re underwater). So to \u201cincrease our understanding and build a database,\u201d Harel says, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to do a lot of experiments on different viruses in different environments.\u201d",
            "Another issue: Many microbes belong to species with lots of related members \u2014 strains that you might think of like siblings. Consider E. coli. These bacteria live almost everywhere. Although most are harmless to people, a few strains can cause serious disease. Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",
            "To find out, scientists will have to just keep listening. Once they have a robust library of sounds, they may be able to tell most microbes apart. That because microbial sounds are very specific, Harel says. It\u2019s like listening for a friend\u2019s voice in a loud place. Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",
            "There\u2019s plenty of research left to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at biology,\u201d Harel explains. For now, he says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see because very few people have ever looked.\u201d",
            "But one day, this type of tech might prove useful beyond the lab. For instance, it could be used in sensors installed at airports and other crowded places. These could then listen for worrisome microbes \u2014 and send out warnings of which ones (and how many) are out there.",

Teenagers, she says, need freedom to develop the confidence that they can navigate the world on their own.",

Parents report increasing discomfort with letting their kids engage in risky, unsupervised play, other research shows.",

The team fine-tuned the amount of pepper added to each mix so that each had the same Scoville rating. Still, some mixes tasted spicier than others. People thought the blend containing Arbol peppers (left) was least spicy. They thought the blend with Fatalii peppers (right) was spiciest.",
            "Peterson\u2019s group took a closer look at the powdered peppers to see what was going on. They analyzed the peppers\u2019 chemical makeup for compounds linked to pungency.",

            "But that\u2019s just one possible explanation, says Jie Zheng. The spice-blocking compounds might bind to a different receptor but still have the same effect. Zheng is a biophysicist at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine. He studies spicy sensations but was not involved in the new study.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s important to know how these compounds work,\u201d Zheng says. \u201cThat would be very informative to guide the applications that people may find.\u201d",

            "The anti-spice compounds might also work as pain relievers, though this hasn\u2019t been tested yet. Gels containing capsaicin are known to relieve nerve pain. But they can also cause a burning sensation. Adding anti-spice compounds to those gels might allow them to provide relief without the burn, Peterson says."

            "The ant and fly fossils suggest Ophiocordyceps evolved alongside its victims, says Zhuang.\u202fThe oldest fossil ant ever found is 113 million years old. So fungi might have been infecting the ancestors of ants almost since they first appeared.\u00a0",
            "The ant in the newfound fossil was a pupa. During this stage of an ant\u2019s life, it can\u2019t move, Zhuang notes. So the fungus was likely not controlling this ant\u2019s behavior.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Perhaps a grown ant noticed the pupa was infected and removed it from the nest,\u202fhe says. Outside, the fungus would now have released its spores in search of its next victim.\u00a0",
            "For an ant or a fly, Labandeira says, this is \u201ca pretty gruesome story.\u201d\u00a0",

            "Humans looking to terraform Mars would first need to bulk up its thin atmosphere. Researchers have suggested using microbes and even asteroid impacts to pump heat-trapping greenhouse gases into Mars\u2019 atmosphere.",
            "A spacecraft slowly descends to the surface of Mars. Once arid and lifeless, the Red Planet now features a lush, green landscape. Passengers watch as a city comes into view. People walk along busy streets, venture into the local park and breathe the Martian air.",
            "Many science fiction writers have envisioned futures like this for Mars. In these stories, humans use so-called terraforming technology to make other planets more Earthlike.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Anyone living on a terraformed Mars should \u201cbe able to walk around outside without a spacesuit,\u201d says \u200b\u200bPaul Byrne. At Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., Byrne studies how planets form. To be hospitable, Mars would need an atmosphere thick enough to retain heat. And there would need to be enough oxygen for life. \u00a0",
            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor trap the sun\u2019s heat. This helps keep our planet warm enough for water to exist as a liquid \u2014 which all life needs.",
            "Most of Mars\u2019 atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide, or CO2. But Mars doesn\u2019t have enough CO2 to trap heat. In fact, the Red Planet\u2019s atmosphere \u200bis \u200b100 times thinner than our own. Being less dense than Earth and half its size, Mars has weaker gravity than our home planet, says Byrne. That makes it \u201charder for it to hang on to an atmosphere.\u201d",
            "Without a heat-absorbing atmosphere, Mars sees temperatures as low as \u2013153\u00b0 Celsius (\u2013225\u00b0 Fahrenheit). And Mars\u2019 extremely low air pressure lowers the boiling point of water. Any liquid water quickly evaporates or freezes, depending on the temperature.",
            "Jumpstarting the greenhouse effect would be key to increasing Mars\u2019 temperature and air pressure, says Byrne. But future Martians would first need a way to produce enough CO2 to fill an entire atmosphere.\u00a0",

            "fCBillions of years ago, \u201csuper eruptions\u201d from Mars\u2019 once-active volcanoes may have spewed carbon dioxide into the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Some researchers have suggested triggering new eruptions from volcanoes such as Olympus Mons (illustrated here) as a way to warm the planet.",
            "In the past, some researchers have suggested extracting CO2 from Mars itself. Engineers would create the gas from carbon and oxygen found in Martian minerals. Or they might release CO2 trapped in Mars\u2019 polar ice caps or below the surface.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But observations of Mars suggest this likely wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cThere probably isn\u2019t enough [CO2] to make an atmosphere even close to what we would need,\u201d says Byrne.\u00a0",
            "In 2018, researchers publishing in Nature Astronomy used spacecraft observations to estimate how much CO2 is locked away in Martian minerals and ice caps. The team found that these sources don\u2019t contain enough CO2 to create a significant greenhouse effect. The entire planet would only produce enough CO2 to thicken the atmosphere to about 7 percent of Earth\u2019s.",
            "Other scientists suggest triggering volcanic eruptions to pump heat-trapping CO2 into Mars\u2019 atmosphere. Volcanoes can help planets replenish atmospheres lost to space, says Byrne. Researchers suspect this is how Venus maintains its CO2-rich atmosphere.",
            "The Red Planet once had active volcanoes, which may have spewed carbon dioxide a few billion years ago. \u201cMost of the activity ended a very long time ago,\u201d says Byrne.",
            "Future civilizations might try to redirect asteroids to create these eruptions. Humankind has already inched toward that feat, says \u200b\u200bSara Seager. This astrophysicist studies planets around other stars at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In 2022, NASA\u2019s DART spacecraft successfully bumped the asteroid Dimorphos closer to the larger rock it orbits. \u201cWith asteroid orbits, you just have to nudge it a little bit,\u201d says Seager. But such impacts probably wouldn\u2019t be too useful for triggering volcanic eruptions on Mars.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u200b\u200bYou\u2019d likely need to whip a lot of space rocks at Mars to release enough CO2 for an atmosphere, says Byrne. And the sheer speed of the incoming asteroids would lead to \u201ccatastrophically damaging impacts.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Let\u2019s say future engineers do figure out some way to warm and thicken up Mars\u2019 atmosphere with a heavy helping of CO2. Once there\u2019s enough CO2 in the air, Mars colonists would want to start tweaking it to resemble ours. \u201cWe [would] need to have enough free oxygen that we can breathe,\u201d says Byrne. Too much, though, could be toxic. (Free oxygen is a form of this element that is not chemically bonded to any others.)",
            "Free oxygen makes up about 21 percent of the air we breathe. The rest is mostly nitrogen with a smattering of other gases. Engineers would want to replicate this blend, says Byrne.",
            "Oxygen-producing microbes could help, says Seager. Research suggests cyanobacteria kicked off a rise in free oxygen in our atmosphere a little over 2 billion years ago. Scientists could tweak the genes of these microbes to help them better withstand Mars\u2019 freezing temps and intense levels of radiation. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Through photosynthesis, these tiny workers could then take in CO2 and pump breathable oxygen into Mars\u2019 atmosphere. And using microbes might offer a safer method of oxygen production than relying on more complex machines. With machines, says Seager, \u201cif one little thing goes wrong, we\u2019re all dead.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Creating a stable atmosphere is only one of many hurdles engineers would face in terraforming Mars. Without a magnetic field to shield it, Mars gets blasted with deadly amounts of radiation from outer space\u200b\u200b\u200b and the sun\u200b. The dusty, pulverized rock covering the planet\u2019s surface contains toxic salts called perchlorates. And since Mars has only about a third of Earth\u2019s gravity, anyone living there would risk their muscles and bones weakening, says Byrne.",
            "Humans can\u2019t reshape Mars with today\u2019s tech. Space agencies around the world are still working toward getting the first astronauts to the Red Planet. NASA aims to achieve this as early as the \u200b\u200b2030s.",
            "That makes it tough to estimate when humans might be able to terraform a planet like Mars, says Byrne. Terraforming tech could take anywhere from a few hundred to several thousands of years to perfect, he says. \u201cCertainly nothing remotely in our time.\u201d",
            "Such tech would have to be reliable enough to protect human lives. Even on Earth, humans can\u2019t survive extremes such as the cold of Antarctica or the intense pressures of our oceans without life support. Small malfunctions to terraforming tech could be catastrophic. \u201cWe\u2019re just so fragile,\u201d says Seager. \u201cThat\u2019s why the whole terraforming question is so challenging.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Some people see a pickleball and want to smash it. When Anchal Sareen saw some pickleballs lying around a lab a few years ago, she thought about submarines and airplanes. As a mechanical engineer who studies how fluids affect movement, she couldn\u2019t help it. So she went right out, bought a balloon and wrapped it around the pickleball. It became the inspiration for a new surface to speed and steer aircrafts and underwater drones.",
            "The surface has dimples, like a golf ball. But they\u2019re adjustable. Add air and the dimples smooth out. Remove air and the dimples deepen.",
            "In a pair of recent papers, Sareen and her team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor have now shown how dimple depth can alter drag. Drag is the friction-like force that slows things down as they travel through a fluid. They\u2019ve also shown how changing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dimples can help steer an object through air, water or other fluids.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a cool idea,\u201d says Christopher Douglas at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Drag is a big challenge, he says. \u201cAnything you can do to minimize drag is great,\u201d says this mechanical engineer who did not work on the new skin.",

            "Douglas studies fluid flow as a way to improve the systems that propel vehicles. Engineers, he notes, have long been altering surface roughness to reduce drag.",
            "But drag isn\u2019t always a bad thing, he adds.",
            "Fins and rudders guide a ship by increasing drag in one place more than in another. This nudges a ship in a desired direction. And dimples might help here, too, says Sareen. She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",
            "They tested these plastic models in wind tunnels to identify how dimple depth affected drag.",
            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/De2VQYkdztM?feature=oembed",
            "Anchal Sareen and her team explain how they used soft robotic technology to develop dynamic surface dimples \u2014 ones that can change at different flow speeds \u2014 to cut the drag experienced by underwater vehicles. It should also allow them to maneuver without fins and rudders.",
            "They\u2019re also developing tests to see if the design would work in real-world conditions, such as the skin of some vessel sailing through air or water.",
            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",
            "\u201dA lot of people have asked me, \u2018Are you planning to patent this as a golf ball which can stay in the air?'\u201d Sareen laughs and says: Not any time soon."

            "Skincare TikTok videos are rising in popularity. However, many of these videos are promoting harmful messages and products. ",
            "More and more kids are posting skincare routines on TikTok. These videos can be a playful and fun way to express oneself. But many of the routines might be more harmful than helpful, a new study shows. The majority of the regimens shown are costly, have harmful ingredients and lack sunscreen. Most don\u2019t offer benefits for young skin. And they may lead to skin damage.",
            "This study suggests that young people are getting a lot of health information from TikTok instead of more reliable sources such as doctors, parents or skincare specialists, says Nusheen Ameenuddin. She\u2019s a pediatrician at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.",
            "Pediatricians and dermatologists are worried about the message these videos are delivering. Namely, they give possibly harmful skincare advice, wrapped up with troubling messages about unrealistic and unhealthy beauty standards.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "When healthcare researcher Tara Lagu asked her 11-year-old niece what she wanted for Christmas, her niece handed her a list of expensive skincare products. According to Lagu\u2019s sister-in-law, all the girl\u2019s friends were taking part in this trend. Lagu was shocked.",
            "Lagu recounted this to Molly Hales. She\u2019s a dermatologist at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, Ill. She also studies how culture and medicine intertwine. Lagu asked Hales if she\u2019d be interested in exploring this skincare trend. Hales jumped at the opportunity.",
            "To start, Hales and a colleague each made TikTok accounts. They reported that they were 13 years old. Then they scrolled through their \u201cFor You\u201d pages until they had seen 100 skincare routine videos. As they watched, the researchers noted information on the content creators, the products and the cost of each regimen.",
            "Most of the videos were pretty popular. They had an average of more than a million views each. Because the creators\u2019 ages weren\u2019t specified, the team assigned age ranges based on appearance and context clues. For example, in one video a creator said, \u201cGet ready with me for the first day of sixth grade.\u201d Most creators used an average of six products, which on average cost a total of $168.",
            "Then the researchers dug into the products and their ingredients.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/emIsUY8EhTo?feature=oembed",
            "Molly Hales and Tara Lagu talk about the some of the problems they see in popular TikTok skincare videos aimed at teens.",
            "Overall, the team found that the products had three main skin risks: skin allergy, irritation and sun sensitivity.",
            "A post shared by Science News Explores (@sn.explores)",
            "More than half of the products had fragrance. Many scents are contact allergens. That means they can cause an allergic reaction when they come in contact with skin. They are one of the most common things people develop a skin allergy to, says Hales.",
            "Plus, the 25 most-viewed videos had an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients. These can cause an itching, burning, tingling or prickling sensation.",
            "The most common of these ingredients were alpha-hydroxy acids. These chemicals exfoliate skin, removing surface layers. They\u2019re common in anti-aging products because they can smooth fine lines and wrinkles and improve skin texture. They\u2019re also used in some products to prevent acne. But they can irritate and damage young skin.",
            "Creators used products with alpha-hydroxy acids an average of three times per video and as many as seven times in one regimen. This is harmful because the chemical becomes more irritating the more you layer it.",
            "Alpha-hydroxy acids also increase the skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends staying out of the sun and using sunscreen with these products. But on average, only 26 percent of the TikTok videos included any type of sun protection. So these regimens would boost the risk of sunburn and other sun damage.",
            "Though not part of the study, pediatrician Molly O\u2019Shea was distressed by the findings. \u201cThe majority of the products that were being shown and demonstrated weren\u2019t designed for young skin,\u201d says O\u2019Shea. She practices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.",
            "Many of the products had abrasive features, such as retinols, scrubs and beads, that can damage the skin. These types of products are usually meant for people whose skin has begun to show signs of aging, says O\u2019Shea. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, using products that are designed for older skin can actually damage your skin.\u201d",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Beyond risks to the skin, the team also had concerns about potential psychological and social risks.",
            "The videos place high importance on physical appearance, Hales says. And much of the content showed creators in large, expensive, private bedrooms and bathrooms. They had drawers stuffed with high-priced skincare products.",
            "The products seemed to be used as status symbols, says Hales. \u201cThat may make someone feel bad if they don\u2019t have the money or they\u2019re not in a position to be able to afford that kind of skincare routine.\u201d Studies have shown that comparing yourself to others who seem \u201cbetter\u201d can have big drawbacks, especially for teens. \u201cIt can have a harmful effect on your self-image,\u201d says Hales.",
            "The study didn\u2019t look at who was consuming this content, says Hales. But this type of media could pose a risk of adverse mental health outcomes for kids and teens who view it, she notes.",
            "The team also paid attention to skin tone. In the United States, beauty standards traditionally have been linked to ideals of whiteness. The researchers wanted to see if the videos idealized white skin.",
            "The majority of content creators they viewed had light skin. But since TikTok\u2019s feed is driven by an algorithm, the researchers don\u2019t know how well what they saw reflects the whole platform. The early videos they saw and engaged with may have prompted more videos from creators with light skin to appear in their feed.",
            "Some popular terms used in these videos, such as \u201cglowy,\u201d could be seen as coded racial language, they note. While \u201cglowy\u201d is not as overt as \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201clight,\u201d when something glows, it gets brighter and lighter, says Hales.",
            "Next, the team would love to study more videos by non-white creators. \u201cHow much content is there from darker-skinned content creators?\u201d asks Hales. \u201cAre the messages and beauty ideals more affirming? Is there anything problematic in the messages that these girls are getting?\u201d",
            "*a_girl_dressed_in_athletic_clothing_sits_under_shade_and_applies_sunscreen_to_her_face",
            "fCDaily sunscreen is important for kids and teens to protect their skin against sun damage.",
            "For pre-adolescents who don\u2019t have any known skin condition, Hales recommends just one product: a daily sunscreen. If the skin becomes oilier during adolescence, she suggests adding a gentle cleanser once or twice a day.",
            "1. Make sure you\u2019re putting on sunscreen every single day. ",
            "2. Read the labels of the products you\u2019re using and see what kind of active ingredients they have. ",
            "3. Look for fragrance-free products. (Fragrance is the most common cause of skin allergy.)",
            "If teens are struggling with acne, some over-the-counter products can be helpful, she notes. However, it\u2019s important to choose products that target the right problem. At that point, she advises teens to talk to their doctor. \u201cPediatricians are usually very equipped to manage mild to moderate acne,\u201d says Hales. If it\u2019s anything more severe, she recommends seeing a dermatologist.",
            "For kids who enjoy watching skincare routines online, Hales notes three steps to be a savvy consumer. First, she says, make sure you\u2019re putting on sunscreen every single day. Second, read the labels of the products you\u2019re using and see what kind of active ingredients they have. Third, look for fragrance-free products, since fragrance is the most common cause of skin allergy.",
            "Hales sees no harm in spending money on safe products that you put on from time to time because it feels luxurious or you enjoy it. But know that you don\u2019t need elaborate skincare routines to take care of your skin. \u201cIn most cases,\u201d she says, \u201cthose products are probably making the skin less healthy, rather than more healthy.\u201d"

            "Bright sunlight can flash off water, glass or metal. The resulting glare will make it hard to see anything clearly. The solution: Put on a pair of sunglasses with polarized lenses.",
            "Regular, tinted sunglasses contain a coating that reduces sunlight\u2019s intense brightness. It\u2019s like putting thin curtains on a window. But to cut the glare, their lenses need more than a tint. They need what\u2019s more like window blinds \u2014 something that lets some light through while blocking the glare.",
            "\u201cPolarized lenses reduce eye strain and improve visibility and contrast,\u201d explains physicist Liliane Ventura. She works at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in Brazil. There, she studies sunglasses and other vision aids.",
            "Special filters in polarized lenses reduce \u201cthe disruptive effects of glare,\u201d she says. That makes \u201coutdoor activities like driving, fishing and skiing safer.\u201d",
            "But an even bigger problem for our vision can be the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) light. Chronic exposure to these rays can lead to permanent eye damage \u2014 such as cataracts and even cancer.",
            "Sunglasses without UV filters may fail to protect our eyes against this damaging light, Ventura\u2019s team has found. Knowing that not all sunglasses are the same, we can look at how these different filters work.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Light travels as a jumble of waves. \u201cThink of sunlight as a bunch of waves vibrating in all possible directions,\u201d Ventura says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call unpolarized light.\u201d When sunlight hits an especially reflective surface, though \u2014 such as water or the hood of a car \u2014 much of the light will reflect in just one direction. Usually, it\u2019s horizontal.",
            "The randomly focused light is known as polarization. Polarized light vibrates in just one direction.",
            "Most reflections from horizontal surfaces polarize light. We experience this as glare. However, reflections are not the only way to polarize light. Certain filters can polarize light, too. And these polarizers explain the glare-diminishing effects of some sunglasses.",
            "\u201cVery clever guys in the past thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we intercept the pathway of polarized light [through the lenses of sunglasses]?\u2019\u201d explains Jos\u00e9 Toschi. An optical engineer, he directs research at Suntech Supplies in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. There, he helps design eyewear, including sunglasses.",
            "*an_illustration_showing_how_polarized_lenses_change_block_horizontal_light_waves",
            "fCPolarized lenses allow vertical light waves (here drawn as light green) to pass through while blocking horizontal light waves (here drawn as orange) \u2014 the ones that cause glare.",
            "This approach applies filters to the lenses. These filters contain molecules lined up next to each other. They create a pattern that resembles a picket fence. \u201cTogether, these molecular lines work [to block out glare],\u201d Toschi says.",
            "Here\u2019s how it works. Imagine passing a rope through an opening between two pickets in a fence. Tie one end to a tree. On the other side of the fence, move the free end of the rope up and down. The vertical waves that this creates in the rope can slide through the opening of the fence. Wave the rope from left to right, however, and the waves will become horizontal \u2014 and won\u2019t pass through the fence. The direction of the waves no longer aligns with the openings between the pickets.",
            "This is exactly what happens with polarized sunglasses. The filter\u2019s tiny molecular lines act like the pickets in the fence. When light waves try to pass through the glasses\u2019 lines, only the vertical waves make it through. All horizontal waves \u2014 the glare \u2014 get blocked out.",
            "With that glare now removed, colors appear more vivid and everything looks clearer. The same will not happen with sunglasses that are merely tinted. Their lenses simply reduce how much overall light reaches your eyes.",

            "Look at a screen \u2014 such as the one on a smart phone \u2014 while wearing the glasses. As you tilt your head or the phone, the screen\u2019s color might change or even darken. If it does, congratulations: You\u2019re wearing polarized lenses.",
            "This works because the lens\u2019 filter is \u201cblocking some of the light,\u201d explains Ventura. And how much it blocks will change as you tilt the phone\u2019s screen.",
            "However, Toschi notes, polarizing lenses alone aren\u2019t enough to protect our eyes. The sun\u2019s UV rays can lead to more than short-term discomfort.",
            "For instance, one study in rabbits found that repeated exposure of their eyes\u2019 cornea \u2014 the clear, outermost layer \u2014 to UV rays reduces the amount of antioxidant enzymes. The paper cautions, this \u201cvery probably contributes to the damage of the cornea (and possibly also deeper parts of the eye)\u201d due to highly reactive oxidants.",
            "Protective lenses should also filter out UV light. And that\u2019s not one wavelength but a spectrum of them. They fall into two bands of light known as UV-A and UV-B.",
            "\u201c[Good] lenses should be able to block the whole spectrum,\u201d Toschi says. \u201cSo, when one buys sunglasses, one should demand the UV400 certificate from the vendor.\u201d It confirms that these glasses contain a coating that blocks the entire UV-A and UV-B spectrum \u2014 wavelengths that span from 280 to 400 nanometers.",

            "Sunglasses have been used for centuries. But as new technology emerges, so do new designs.",
            "For instance, not all light passes through sunglasses\u2019 lenses on its way to your eyes. Some can come around the sides, Ventura notes. Some glasses are now being designed to prevent sunlight from entering through frame edges.",

This short, double-speed video shows it eating another of its species.",
            "While walking in the Waianae Mountains almost 20 years ago, some scientists spied an odd caterpillar next to a spider web in a tree hole. \u201cIt [was] covered in little bits of bug,\u201d recalls Dan Rubinoff. He works for the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa in Honolulu. As an entomologist, he studies insects.",

Over the next two decades, he and others spotted 62 of these bone-collector caterpillars. All were within a 15-square-kilometer (almost 6-square-mile) range.",
            "Each lived in a spider web tucked away in a tree, log or rock cavity. And there was never more than one per web (otherwise one would eat the other). The caterpillar lurks in a web, waiting to prey on insects stuck there. The caterpillar masks its scent and texture with leftovers from prey on which the spider had dined. The caterpillar even wears skin shed by its eight-legged landlord.",

            "When assembling its prey-based wardrobe, a caterpillar carefully probes and rotates those bodily remains. The carnivorous critter first nibbles large pieces down to size. Then, it weaves them onto its silken case. After a few months of feasting, the caterpillar seals off the open end of its case. Now, that case will become its cocoon as the caterpillar transforms into a moth.",
            "Scientists analyzed the bone collector moth\u2019s genes. They found that its lineage is at least 6 million years old. That\u2019s even older than the island of Oahu! So this critter\u2019s ancestors may have originated on a different island. Other Hyposmocoma moths are represented by multiple species on several of the Hawaiian Islands. But the bone collector is the only species in its line, Rubinoff says.",

            "Columbus, Ohio \u2014 Preserving threatened coral reefs is no longer enough. Now, we must help build new ones, say Ja Young Kim, 17, and Jiho Kong, 19. They\u2019ve just designed one new option: robotic nurseries to attract and nurture baby corals.",
            "These modular units start as floating, hexagon-shaped cells. Once deployed in the water, they can link together to make large ocean habitats. These apartment-like structures even monitor for potential dangers. Before turbulent weather might turn young colonies belly-up, robots can propel the coral apartment buildings to safety.",

            "Jiho and Ja Young live in Saipan. It\u2019s the largest of the 14 Northern Mariana Islands, a volcanic archipelago north of Australia. The world\u2019s deepest ocean site \u2014 the Mariana Trench \u2014 lies just east of this island chain.",
            "Saipan is \u201ca beautiful place that is surrounded by the ocean,\u201d notes Jiho. \u201cI\u2019m a diver.\u201d Just off the white sand beaches here, \u201cthere used to be a beautiful coral reef.\u201d A few years ago, the coral here appeared \u201cevery different color,\u201d Jiho recalls. No longer. The reef is now bleached white and dead.",
            "Dying coral is \u201cnot just a story that we can hear from newsletters or books,\u201d Ja Young says. For her, the problem can\u2019t be ignored. So she and Jiho teamed up to build a fleet of robotic apartment complexes for baby coral. It would provide them homes. And being mobile, they can move when storms threaten.",
            "Their work earned these juniors at Saipan International School a place here, last month, as finalists at the 75th annual Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF. Society for Science \u2014 which also publishes this magazine \u2014 created ISEF and still runs it. This year\u2019s 1,657 finalists came from 62 nations or territories. Together, they took home nearly $9 million in prizes.",
            "Each cell is about the size of a small microwave oven. Individual cells can link up with others, forming platforms that roll with the waves.",
            "For this project, \u201cWe created everything,\u201d says Ja Young. \u201cWe 3-D printed everything.\u201d They chose materials that will break down in the ocean over time. That way, they won\u2019t pollute the environment if individual units separate and get lost.",
            "The duo tested their cells\u2019 ability to link up in a borrowed swimming pool in Korea, says Ja Young. \u201cAnd then we borrowed this wave-creating machine in order to make sure [their habitat won\u2019t] just float away.\u201d",
            "Their system consists of two types of cells. The first offers a safe harbor for coral larvae. They can attach to these \u201ccoral cells\u201d and grow. The second are power cells. These similarly shaped units can drive the coral-housing units. Each power cell \u201chas a propeller,\u201d Ja Young points out, and runs on solar energy. So power cells can motor coral cells to the perfect nursery location. Once they arrive, these cells can link together. A tether connects them to the ocean floor. This ensures they won\u2019t drift away.",
            "To advertise the housing units have arrived, the cells sing a song.",
            "This \u201cspecial soundscape,\u201d Ja Young explains, \u201ccan attract the coral larvae onto the structure.\u201d Its melody \u2014 \u201cthe sound of healthy corals\u201d \u2014 sounds like soft bubbles and gently sloshing water, she says. When larvae hear it, they\u2019ll flock to it as they would to a healthy reef.",

            "fCWhen deployed underwater, a coral cell (left unit) provides a safe haven for larvae to establish new colonies. A power cell (right unit) can link with that undersea houseboat and propel it to safety when dangerous storms may threaten these accommodations.",
            "Once they arrive, the tiny larvae begin setting up a new artificial reef. However, this apartment complex can do something natural reefs can\u2019t. It can flee danger.",
            "This could counter a problem seen with other coral-restoration systems. Jiho and Ja Young learned that many weren\u2019t very successful. Take the type known as coral trees. Once installed on the ocean floor, many of these vanish.",
            "For every 10 coral trees installed, \u201ceight will be missing by the end of the year,\u201d Ja Young says. No one knows what happens to them. \u201cWe wanted to fix that,\u201d she says.",
            "Watch this video of the designers of the new coral sanctuary describing what motivated them to create the new tech and how it would work.",
            "Their solution was to build an escape plan into their housing units. For example, Ja Young says, \u201cThere could be a typhoon coming.\u201d The undersea waves kicked up by such a storm could destroy the cells. \u201cWe cannot make the house not blow away,\u201d she says. But \u201cwe can make it run away.\u201d",
            "Their coral-housing units not only can move, but also decide when it\u2019s time to move.",
            "Jiho spearheaded this part of the project. \u201cI wanted to link my knowledge about robotics and computer science to this project,\u201d he says.",
            "He linked the cells to the internet so they can receive ocean data. These include temperature readings and other weather updates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They use open-source data, which are freely available for all to use.",
            "Their system\u2019s motorized cells use these data to make decisions. If a dangerous storm looms, these cells will know. They can turn on their propellers and head for safer waters. An \u201calgorithm and the website itself can also designate a destination,\u201d says Ja Young.",
            "Even if people do nothing, these cells can execute an escape. Thanks to clever programming, the cells can pick their own destination. They also can calculate the best route. This escape feature sets their technology apart from other coral-transplant systems, says Jiho. Few such technologies can flee danger. And those that do need a lot of human help. Human labor makes them \u201cless efficient in both cost and time,\u201d Jiho says.",
            "Each cell costs about $120 to make, says Ja Young. That\u2019s far less than similar technologies. Most, he says, cost about \u201ca thousand times more.\u201d",
            "The coral apartments must still undergo ocean tests. Simulations show a lot of promise. However, unseen problems could occur.",
            "Ja Young recalls the kaleidoscopic colors of local reefs from snorkeling trips with her dad. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s pink! Blue! It\u2019s colorful inside,\u201d she remembers. She was in middle school then. Today, waves sweep bleached coral fragments onto the sand. Ja Young hopes their new invention will do more than try to preserve the past. She hopes it will rebuild a more colorful future.",

            "Many of us have eaten something that left us sick. \u201cNot only is it terrible in the moment, but it leads us to not eat those foods again,\u201d notes Christopher Zimmerman. He\u2019s a neuroscientist at Princeton University in New Jersey.",

            "Mice usually need an immediate reward or punishment to learn something, notes neuroscientist Richard Palmiter. He works at the University of Washington in Seattle. Even one minute\u2019s delay between cause (say, pulling a lever) and effect (getting a treat) can be too long for mice to learn the two are related.",

            "The researchers focused on a bundle of neurons called the POMC. It sits in a part of the brain that controls hunger, known as the hypothalamus. These cells are known to make mice \u2014 and people \u2014 feel full. The team wondered if the same cells might help drive sugar cravings.",
            "When an animal eats, POMC neurons kick off a cascade of activity. They send messages to other groups of brain cells that give a sense of feeling full. That feeling tells the animal to stop eating.",
            "When the mice were offered sugar, though, a different pathway out of the POMC lit up. \u201cWe found that the POMC neurons, which tell us how full we are, are also quickly turned on when [mice] see signs of sugar,\u201d says Min\u00e8re.",

            "Researchers shared the new finding March 19 in Nature.\u00a0",
            "Parakeets have special brain areas for making language. These language centers work much as those in humans do. So far, these parrots are the only animals other than people known to have brains that work in this way, says Michael Long in New York City. A neuroscientist, he works at New York University Langone Health.",

It sits in a front part of the birds\u2019 brains. The two NYU Langone researchers tracked the activity of cells here as the birds chirped and trilled away. That activity was tied to how the birds made those sounds, they found.",
            "How the activity was organized turns out to be pretty simple, Long says. He compares it to a keyboard. This keyboard can produce a range of sounds \u2014 consonants, vowels, high pitches and low pitches. A parakeet can combine different sounds \u201cby just playing this vocal keyboard,\u201d Long says.",

This could be \u201ca very tidy example\u201d of what\u2019s known as convergent evolution, Long says. The brains of people and these small parrots both developed ways that let them make a complex series of sounds. But how this happened evolved separately in each species.",
            "Scientists now know more about how the birds\u2019 brains help these parrots talk. But another question remains: What are these birds talking about?",

            "Through these kinds of experiments, Long says, people may come to challenge the idea that complex language is a particularly human behavior. Parakeets might be telling us that people aren\u2019t the sole species with a gift of gab.",

            "Like a typical atom, tauonium would be made of smaller particles. But it would not have protons and elections. Instead, tauonium would contain particles called tau and anti-tau. A tau is similar to an electron and carries a negative charge. An anti-tau carries a positive charge. Just like in a typical atom, attraction between opposite charges would hold tauonium together. But unlike other atoms, it would not have strong force.",

            "Why do scientists suspect tauonium might exist? Something similar was seen decades ago. In the 1950s, researchers discovered positronium. This is a type of atom that lacks protons and neutrons. It is made of an electron and a positron. Think of a positron as a positively charged electron. A positron is to an electron what an anti-tau is to a tau. Like tauonium, the pull between opposite charges binds this atom together.",
            "Scientists haven\u2019t yet found tauonium. To search for it, they plan to smash particles together that produce tau particles. They hope the process will also produce tauonium.",
            "If it works, they expect the atom to be short-lived. Based on what they know of similar particles, scientists predict that the particles tau and anti-tau will collide. This collision would occur almost at once. And it would destroy the atom an instant after it formed.",

She screens patients, too, for anxiety and depression. If someone is struggling with those conditions, she makes a plan to help with that, as well.",
            "Varenicline is now another medicine that McGee could suggest for her 16- and 17-year-old patients and their parents. As a twice-a-day pill, it can be taken outside of school hours, she notes. \u201cI\u2019m glad to know that there is something else potentially in my toolbox.\u201d"
