            "In June 2017, Cathy Raley was about to take her dog on a hike when she suddenly broke out in hives. Her tongue swelled and her throat got tight. \u201cThat\u2019s when I called 911,\u201d she recalls.",
            "On the way to the hospital, Raley stopped being able to swallow. She was immediately given a steroid. She also received a medicine for severe allergic reactions called epinephrine (Ep-ih-NEFF-rin). That eventually calmed her symptoms, though Raley had to spend four hours in the hospital before she could go home.",
            "She\u2019d clearly suffered a major allergic reaction \u2014 but to what? She was 61 years old and didn\u2019t know of anything she was allergic to. So she went to an allergist who combed through her history for clues to what happened.",
            "One hint: Raley had recently had another bout of hives. That one erupted in the middle of the night \u2014 a sign that it had been a delayed reaction to something. And both times, the hives had occurred after she\u2019d cooked red meat: beef and pork.",
            "\u201cI have no idea if it\u2019s related,\u201d Raley finally told the allergist, but \u201ctwo months ago, I got bitten by a tick.\u201d",
            "That turned out to be the key to solving Raley\u2019s mystery.",

            "She was later diagnosed with alpha-gal syndrome. This is an allergy to red meat that scientists knew could develop in response to the bite of a lone star tick. Raley, however, had been bitten while hiking near her home in Olympia, Wash. Lone star ticks are found only east of the Rocky Mountains \u2014 thousands of kilometers (miles) away.",
            "Two new research reports \u2014 one on Raley\u2019s case and\u00a0another on a woman in Maine \u2014\u00a0now suggest the lone star tick isn\u2019t the only U.S. tick that can trigger this allergy. The western blacklegged tick and the deer tick may trigger an allergy to red meat, too.",
            "\u201cIt was a very surprising finding,\u201d says Hanna Oltean. She works at Washington State\u2019s Department of Health in Shoreline. As an epidemiologist, she studies the spread and control of diseases. Oltean was part of a team that described the two alpha-gal cases in Emerging Infectious Diseases in April.",

            "Scientists discovered alpha-gal syndrome in 2009.",
            "It was first reported in 24 people who\u2019d had allergic reactions a few hours after eating red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. More than eight in every 10 of them recalled being bitten by ticks before showing these symptoms. That raised scientists\u2019 suspicions that tick bites may have triggered the allergies.",
            "The saliva of certain tick species carries a sugar molecule called alpha-gal. These species include the lone star tick and others found in Europe and Australia. When these ticks bite, the sugar molecule and other compounds can get into someone\u2019s body. There, they can somehow make the immune systems go haywire.",
            "The next exposure to alpha-gal may trigger an allergic reaction in these people. Red meats and other animal products (such as milk and gelatin) are rich in alpha-gal. So those foods could incite that bad reaction.",

            "fCScientists knew that alpha-gal syndrome could develop in response to the bite of a lone star tick (shown). But new research suggests that other types of ticks can trigger this allergy as well.",
            "\u201cAlpha-gal syndrome can present very differently from patient to patient,\u201d says Johanna Salzer. This epidemiologist works at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga.",
            "Some people may get hives and throat swelling, as Raley did. Other cases may look more like the woman from Maine. She\u2019d been bitten by a deer tick. Later, after eating red meat, she developed abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.",
            "The delayed and often mysterious nature of a patient\u2019s stomach issues can make alpha-gal syndrome hard to diagnose, says Sarah McGill. As a gastroenterologist, she specializes in the digestive system. She works at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill.",
            "In the past, doctors hadn\u2019t considered food allergies when seeing adult patients with chronic digestive problems, she says. Why? Most food allergies develop when people are young. \u201cBut alpha-gal syndrome is very unique,\u201d she says. \u201cAdults can get it suddenly.\u201d And there\u2019s no cure \u2014 though some people may eventually be able to eat red meat again without issue.\u00a0",
            "Another problem: Many doctors and nurses have never heard of alpha-gal syndrome.",
            "In one U.S. survey of healthcare providers,\u00a0more than four in every 10 had not heard of the condition. Among those who had, about one in three didn\u2019t know how it was acquired. Nearly half didn\u2019t know\u00a0what tests to order\u00a0to diagnose it. Salzer and her colleagues shared these results in 2023.",
            "A bite from certain tick species could leave you allergic to red meat. Lone star tick bites can trigger alpha-gal syndrome \u2014 a mysterious allergy to a sugar molecule found in red meat, milk and gelatin. Now, scientists have identified two additional tick species in the U.S. that may also be responsible for causing this condition. Watch for tips from scientists on how to avoid tick bites, especially if you spend a lot of time in the woods. #tickseason #ticks #alphagalsyndrome #redmeat #redmeatallergy #allergyproblems #science #sciencenews ",
            "McGill has seen patients whose alpha-gal symptoms were dismissed by other doctors. When patients asked to be tested for the condition, some doctors had refused.",
            "Those experiences remind McGill of celiac disease, another digestive illness. Here, the immune system overreacts to gluten. This disease was misunderstood for a long time. Patients were sometimes told their symptoms were in their head, McGill says. \u201cI see that same pattern happening with alpha-gal syndrome.\u201d",
            "Increasing awareness among doctors and nurses could speed up diagnosis, Salzer says. That in turn could help patients feel better faster.",
            "It\u2019s hard to know just how many patients we\u2019re talking about. While alpha-gal syndrome appears fairly rare, exact numbers are hard to pin down. Salzer was part of a team that tallied about\u00a0110,000 suspected cases in the United States from 2010 to 2022. But this might be an undercount. As many as 450,000 people might have been affected during this time, those researchers say.",
            "And this condition can be life-threatening, Oltean emphasizes. But if people know the risks, she adds, \u201cthey can take appropriate precautions.\u201d",
            "For Oltean, that means avoiding tick bites. She knows that can be difficult, especially during tick season. Ticks are generally seeking blood meals from early spring to late fall, depending on where you live.",
            "After being outdoors, many people scan their bodies to ensure they\u2019re not carrying any ticks. Quickly finding and removing those tiny arachnids can keep them from spreading diseases. That\u2019s the case for Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A tick must latch onto someone\u2019s body for hours or days to transmit the bacteria that cause those illnesses.",
            "\u201cThat does not seem to be the case with alpha-gal syndrome,\u201d Oltean says. There are no bacteria being transmitted. Tick saliva is thought to cause the allergy. So it\u2019s possible that a single bite from a tick \u2014 even one yanked away at once \u2014 could spark the condition.\u00a0",
            "Suspected cases of alpha-gal syndrome cluster mostly in the southern, midwestern and mid-Atlantic United States. This map shows cases from 2017 to 2022. Cases are shown per 1 million people in the population per year. Areas with larger case counts are shown in dark blue.",

            "Oltean is brimming with tips to prevent tick bites. Walk in the center of trails. Avoid tall brush and grassy areas. Wear tightly woven clothing. Apply tick repellent to exposed skin, and shower soon after being outdoors.\u00a0",
            "Since alpha-gal syndrome was discovered so recently, there\u2019s still a lot to learn about who\u2019s most at risk.",
            "\u201cWhy are some people bitten by ticks all the time and they never develop alpha-gal syndrome?\u201d Salzer asks. She also wants to know just how long a tick must attach for someone to get the condition.",
            "Her research suggests that most U.S. alpha-gal cases have happened in the lone star ticks\u2019 range. Oltean wonders why lone star ticks seem better at triggering an immune response. And do multiple tick bites over time make someone more likely to develop the condition?\u00a0",

            "To do that, she built a clinostat. This device rotates like a fast clock. It doesn\u2019t mimic microgravity, exactly. It just constantly changes the direction of gravity for anything attached to it.",

Magnetized seeds release more auxin. \u201cThat\u2019s a plant hormone,\u201d he explains. More auxin allows water to enter cells more easily. Plant cells also make new proteins faster. So scientists have magnetized some seeds to boost plant growth.",

Dental health can have a big effect on someone\u2019s overall health. That\u2019s why fluoride is added to toothpaste and other oral-care products.",

It\u2019s up to state and local governments to decide if they want to follow that guidance. In 2022, the CDC reported that nearly two in every three Americans received fluoridated water.",
            "But this water treatment practice is coming under new scrutiny.",
            "In March, Utah became the first state to ban water fluoridation. Florida followed suit in May. Many cities and towns across the country are considering it. And on April 7, one federal official said he would tell the CDC to stop recommending this water treatment.",
            "To understand the impacts of such a move, some researchers have studied public health effects in places that no longer add fluoride to water. Calgary is one such city. Juneau, Alaska, is another. It stopped this water treatment in 2007.",
            "The data may offer a cautionary tale for other cities and towns. Science News spoke with researchers and other experts in both cities. They described what can happen when local governments opt to stop adding fluoride to drinking water.",
            "Lindsay McLaren says she never expected to end up studying fluoride. At the University of Calgary, she studies how public policies can affect people\u2019s health. She hadn\u2019t thought much about fluoridation \u2014 until 2011. That\u2019s when the Calgary City Council decided to stop adding fluoride to the city\u2019s water.",
            "The move gave McLaren an idea for a study. She\u2019d look at how the dental health of local children fared once fluoride was gone.",

            "In Calgary, the team surveyed second-graders about seven years after water fluoridation had ended. So these kids likely had never been exposed to fluoride in their drinking water. Of 2,649 children, 65 percent had tooth decay. That\u2019s nearly two in every three. In Edmonton, 55 percent of the 2,600 surveyed children had tooth decay.",
            "On a population level, that difference is \u201cquite large,\u201d McLaren says.",
            "\u201cCompared to Edmonton kids, Calgary kids were now considerably worse as far as dental health goes,\u201d McLaren says. Her team looked at other factors, such as diet, social measures and family income. But none of these, she says, could explain the differences between dental health in the two cities\u2019 kids.",
            "And the number of kids with decay wasn\u2019t the only difference. More kids treated for tooth decay-related problems had to be placed under general anesthesia in Calgary than in Edmonton. That finding comes from an April 2024 study in the Canadian Journal of Public Health. It suggests the decay in these kids may have been more severe or extensive. From 2018 to 2019, 32 out of every 10,000 children in Calgary were put under general anesthesia to treat tooth decay. In Edmonton, it was roughly half as many.",
            "The findings don\u2019t surprise local dentists, says Bruce Yaholnitsky. He specializes in gum disease and other mouth issues in Calgary. \u201cThis is just obvious to us. But you need to have proper science to prove, in some cases, the obvious.\u201d",

Seeing a lowered IQ does not prove that higher levels of fluoride caused it. Indeed, that warning is noted on the program\u2019s website.",
            "Meyer cautions against making decisions \u201cbased on weak or misrepresented evidence.\u201d Choosing to stop adding fluoride, she says, \u201cis not a precaution, it\u2019s negligence.\u201d",

Others, like plastic lanyards, hurt to touch when they whipped up and down. Still others, such as silicone, reflected too much light to clearly display projected images.",

That was true even though some had been concerned that the display would feel unpleasant to touch. \u201cIt feels really soft, actually,\u201d says Bouzbib. \u201cIt tickles a bit.\u201d",

You can touch those displays too, he points out. But it\u2019s hard to use levitation to make images bigger than about one centimeter (0.4 inch) across.",
            "The elastic-band display is 19 centimeters (7.5 inches) wide and 8 centimeters (3 inches) deep. That\u2019s about the size of a square Tupperware container. \u201cNow, people can start to experiment and play around with it,\u201d Fushimi says.

Then you can no longer reach through the display.\u201d In other words, it wouldn\u2019t work for building something like a Star Trek holodeck. But Fushimi could imagine it being scaled up to a desktop-sized device.",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",

However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",

            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",

Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Also, exoskeletons generally do not grow with an animal. Animals must shed their outgrown armor before they can grow a better-fitting set. This process is called molting, and it can be dangerous. During this time, an animal may be very vulnerable to predators. And sometimes, an animal cannot shed its old skeleton properly. This can be deadly. After molting, the animal\u2019s new exoskeleton usually takes time to harden.",

We would just take a little snippet from the leafy appendages. It\u2019s like taking a little toe clipping. After collecting the sample, we\u2019d let the dragon go. We needed to make sure that we didn\u2019t resample the same individual seadragon. That would ruin the statistics.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Another recording showed three narwhals following a large char, with one whale taking the lead. It lightly nudged and flipped the fish with the tip or side of its tusk. In this way, it altered the fish\u2019s path. There\u2019s little evidence that narwhals normally eat much char. And winter, not summer, is their big dining season. So this video seems to show the whale and fish investigating one another.",

            "Furuya is not an engineer. So he told one of his colleagues about his idea. He wondered if it might be possible to build such a robot. And he was told, \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d",

It moved the fingers faster than the musicians could manage on their own. For the second group, the device moved the fingers slowly in the same tricky pattern. The third group experienced rapid finger motion, but all the fingers moved at once. Two other groups didn\u2019t use the robo-hand. One of these continued to practice the tricky pattern on their own. The final group just rested.",
            "Afterward, only one group could play the tricky pattern faster than before. These were the pianists who used the robotic hand to practice the complex finger motions quickly. The time between their keystrokes sped up by around 6 percent, on average.",
            "The pianists often told Furuya that their fingers felt \u201cvery light\u201d after using the robot. Also, they only used the device on their right hands. Yet their left hand\u2019s speed also improved!",

These connections could help explain why the training improved the musicians\u2019 speed in their left hands, even though they only wore the device on their right.",
            "Doctors and researchers already use robotic devices similar to this one in therapy, notes Hatsopoulos. For example, a stroke often impairs movement on one side of the body. Using a robot to move an arm can help a patient get back their former range of motion.",
            "Exoskeletons that move fingers and hands have lagged behind, though. That\u2019s because robotic fingers are complex and \u201charder to build,\u201d says Hatsopoulos.",

            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

Although these stress responses may not feel good, they are totally normal. They\u2019re your body\u2019s way of sharpening your focus and boosting the energy you have to help you perform well.\u00a0",
            "When we encounter a big challenge or risk \u2014 or become overly excited \u2014 our body responds in a way to keep us safe. We\u2019re hardwired for this. These changes supercharge how our body functions.",
            "An increased heart rate and breathing will send more oxygen to our muscles and brain. Our muscles tense so they can react quickly. By sweating, our body attempts to avoid overheating. Our pupils enlarge so we become more aware of our surroundings. And our body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, to boost our energy and focus.",
            "Together, these changes are known as the fight-or-flight response. They\u2019re automatically triggered by what\u2019s known as the sympathetic nervous system.

Today, we face very different risks than people did 300,000 years ago. But our sympathetic nervous system remains very important to our making it through challenging events.",
            "It turns on when we play sports, perform or catch ourselves from falling. It motivates us to study or concentrate on difficult tasks.

Stress hormone levels lower, and feel-good hormones \u2014 such as oxytocin and serotonin \u2014 become somewhat higher. This lets us feel safe.

As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux.
