            "Confusion over the sun\u2019s color may come from mixing up two things \u2014 an object\u2019s apparent hue and the wavelength where its light is strongest. That last feature is known as the light\u2019s peak intensity. These two aren\u2019t always the same.",

Sunlight spans the whole light spectrum \u2014 from long-wavelength radio waves to short-wavelength X-rays. The part we can see makes up a small chunk in the middle.

            "Starting in 2013, surveys asked if these kids had ever used tobacco products. They also asked if kids ever had an ADHD diagnosis. If they had, did they take medicine for it? (Common treatments include medicines, talk therapy or both.)",
            "Over the next nine years, follow-up surveys asked about tobacco use and any ADHD symptoms.",

            "Synthesis is a fancy word meaning to create something. So nucleosynthesis means nuclei are being created. In this case, the nuclei are inside atoms. That\u2019s a big deal because an atom\u2019s nucleus determines which element it is. By making new nuclei, nucleosynthesis makes different elements, too.",
            "Nucleosynthesis works in one of two ways. It can start with protons and neutrons (or something even smaller) and bind them into a nucleus. Or it can start with a few lighter nuclei and fuse them into a heavier one.",
            "An atom\u2019s nucleus contains protons and neutrons. An atom\u2019s atomic number \u2014 the number of protons it contains \u2014 determines the element\u2019s identity. For example, all helium atoms have two protons. Helium\u2019s atomic number is 2. If an atom has two protons, it\u2019s a helium atom. If, by some process, a helium atom gains two more protons, it will no longer be helium. It would now be beryllium.",
            "This process doesn\u2019t always change the element. If only the number of neutrons in a nucleus changes, the element stays the same. That\u2019s because the number of protons, not neutrons, determines the element type.",
            "Most nucleosynthesis occurs in the cosmos. It started with the Big Bang, which exploded our universe into being. As matter and space rapidly expanded from the Big Bang, particles started to group together. Some of those particles were protons and neutrons. And in joining them together, the Big Bang created atomic nuclei. Scientists believe that lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, came from nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang.",
            "Other elements have been forged inside stars. During its lifetime, a star fuses lighter nuclei \u2014 such as hydrogen and helium \u2014 into heavier ones. The extreme gravity in the star\u2019s core drives this process. This is called stellar nucleosynthesis. This is where much of the carbon, iron and other elements crucial for life originate.",
            "Even in death, stars can form new elements. When supermassive stars die, they don\u2019t just fade away. They explode as a supernova. This releases huge amounts of energy. Enough energy to fuse nuclei together and create new elements. Scientists believe supernova nucleosynthesis made much of the oxygen in our universe. Supernovas likely cooked up most of the elements heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium, too.",

That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface.

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years.

These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",

These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",

And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",

            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",

And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",

But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost.

            "A narwhal\u2019s tusk is an elongated, spiraled tooth. It protrudes from the top lip of males (and some females). Males can grow to 5 meters (16 feet) long, with their tusks spanning another half their body length.",
            "Biologists suspect those tusks evolved so that males could show off or compete for mates. But past research has found they can offer other benefits, too. For instance, the tusks can sense changes in water temperature and salinity.",
            "Technologies involving genetics, satellite tagging, aerial counts and mapping have offered insights on these elusive whales. Still, they provided only snapshots of what these unusual animals do, says O\u2019Corry-Crowe.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/JUFJIZtPLk8?feature=oembed",
            "In this drone footage, narwhals prod, flip and guide a fish with their tusks, possibly playing with it.",
            "So he decided to try what he calls an \u201cold-style natural history and behavioral observation.\u201d But not totally old-style. His team enlisted a remotely operated flying drone. Then they spent hours in the summer of 2022 filming narwhals as they swam in an island bay in the Canadian High Arctic.",
            "One recording captured three narwhals chasing several Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a type of fish. The whales sometimes swung their tusks like baseball bats to thwack fish \u2014 stunning them \u2014 before chowing down on them.",
            "Another recording showed three narwhals following a large char, with one whale taking the lead. It lightly nudged and flipped the fish with the tip or side of its tusk. In this way, it altered the fish\u2019s path. There\u2019s little evidence that narwhals normally eat much char. And winter, not summer, is their big dining season. So this video seems to show the whale and fish investigating one another.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s this tentativeness,\u201d O\u2019Corry-Crowe explains. Then, he notes, the char \u201cmakes a dramatic movement.\u201d Afterward, the whale \u201cjust recoils and goes whoa!\u201d",
            "Moreover, he adds, that repeated tusk action \u2014 and the fact the whales didn\u2019t try to eat the fish \u2014 suggest the narwhals were just playing.",
            "Because of the Arctic\u2019s harsh environment, people often think creatures there are constantly fighting to survive, O\u2019Corry-Crowe says. But his team\u2019s new study hints that sometimes these animals have time to explore, and possibly play \u2014 at least during their \u201csummer vacation.\u201d",

            "Furuya is not an engineer. So he told one of his colleagues about his idea. He wondered if it might be possible to build such a robot. And he was told, \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d",

It moved the fingers faster than the musicians could manage on their own. For the second group, the device moved the fingers slowly in the same tricky pattern. The third group experienced rapid finger motion, but all the fingers moved at once. Two other groups didn\u2019t use the robo-hand. One of these continued to practice the tricky pattern on their own. The final group just rested.",
            "Afterward, only one group could play the tricky pattern faster than before. These were the pianists who used the robotic hand to practice the complex finger motions quickly. The time between their keystrokes sped up by around 6 percent, on average.",
            "The pianists often told Furuya that their fingers felt \u201cvery light\u201d after using the robot. Also, they only used the device on their right hands. Yet their left hand\u2019s speed also improved!",

            "When someone wiggles their own fingers, a different part of the brain \u2014 the motor cortex \u2014 manages that motion.",
            "But these two parts of the brain share information, says Hatsopoulos. So do the left and right sides of the brain, which control the opposite sides of the body, he notes. These connections could help explain why the training improved the musicians\u2019 speed in their left hands, even though they only wore the device on their right.",
            "Doctors and researchers already use robotic devices similar to this one in therapy, notes Hatsopoulos. For example, a stroke often impairs movement on one side of the body. Using a robot to move an arm can help a patient get back their former range of motion.",
            "Exoskeletons that move fingers and hands have lagged behind, though. That\u2019s because robotic fingers are complex and \u201charder to build,\u201d says Hatsopoulos.",
            "The robot hand Furuya\u2019s team built can only move fingers one way \u2014 in a downward motion. \u201cWe are developing a more complex robot,\u201d he says. It will be able to move two joints at once. That will allow for even more complex finger movements.",
            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

Although these stress responses may not feel good, they are totally normal. They\u2019re your body\u2019s way of sharpening your focus and boosting the energy you have to help you perform well.\u00a0",
            "When we encounter a big challenge or risk \u2014 or become overly excited \u2014 our body responds in a way to keep us safe. We\u2019re hardwired for this. These changes supercharge how our body functions.",
            "An increased heart rate and breathing will send more oxygen to our muscles and brain. Our muscles tense so they can react quickly. By sweating, our body attempts to avoid overheating. Our pupils enlarge so we become more aware of our surroundings. And our body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, to boost our energy and focus.",
            "Together, these changes are known as the fight-or-flight response. They\u2019re automatically triggered by what\u2019s known as the sympathetic nervous system.

She\u2019s a neurologist for children in Denver, Colo.\u00a0",

Today, we face very different risks than people did 300,000 years ago. But our sympathetic nervous system remains very important to our making it through challenging events.",
            "It turns on when we play sports, perform or catch ourselves from falling. It motivates us to study or concentrate on difficult tasks.

            "Here, our heart rate and breathing become slow and steady. Our muscles relax. Stress hormone levels lower, and feel-good hormones \u2014 such as oxytocin and serotonin \u2014 become somewhat higher. This lets us feel safe.

            "Many of the reports Hough turned up seem to fit with a shaking that would have rated 2 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. Scientists use this scale to rate quakes based on the damage they cause. An MMI of 2 is fairly weak. It would likely be \u201cfelt only by a few persons at rest,\u201d Hough says, \u201cespecially on upper floors of a building.\u201d",

This could be \u201ccapable of generating methane,\u201d he notes, which can support a flame. Also helpful, he adds, would be a finding of granite-based bedrock \u201ccontaining radium, which can produce radon.\u201d",

            "Since this simulated phase shared the same cubic crystal structure as ice VII, it became known as plastic ice VII. But scientists didn\u2019t know whether it truly existed. Running tests at such high pressures wasn\u2019t possible, back then.",
            "For the new study, Bove was part of a team that used a relatively new tool. It can measure the motions of molecules under extreme pressures. It does this by shooting them with tiny particles called neutrons.",
            "Those neutrons interact with molecules in their samples. Depending on the molecules\u2019 motion, the neutrons gain or lose energy \u2014 then scatter away toward a detector. Measuring the scattered neutrons\u2019 energies allowed Bove\u2019s team to figure out how the ice molecules moved. From this, they could identify the ice phase that had formed.",
            "Above 177\u00b0 Celsius (350\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and at a pressure about 28 times that of the deepest point in Earth\u2019s oceans, Bove\u2019s team observed plastic ice VII. As expected, its structure formed a cubic-crystal lattice. And its molecules rotated about as fast as those in liquid water.",
            "*Animations_show_water_molecules_moving_around_in_the_liquid_state,_vibrating_in_place_in_the_solid_s",
            "fCIn liquid water, individual molecules can freely move about and rotate, while in solid ice they can only vibrate in place. In plastic ice, water molecules are held in place but still are able to rotate.",
            "However, one detail differed from what had been predicted. Rather than revolve freely, plastic ice VII\u2019s molecules appeared to swivel in jerky motions. As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux. He\u2019s a planetary scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Plastic ice VII could have formed then because water hadn\u2019t escaped yet from those moons\u2019 high-pressure interiors, he explains.",
            "The new observations could help researchers piece together the story of how these moons changed over time, he says.",
            "And beyond our solar system, the strange ice may be found on the bottom of super deep oceans on exoplanets. Scientists think plastic ice may cover the seafloors of their oceans.",
            "It would be interesting to find out whether seafloor nutrients could move through plastic ice and into the oceans above, Journaux says. \u201cThat would actually feed the ocean with more nutrients.\u201d And those nutrients could make the oceans more habitable, he says.",

            "That\u2019s because the shape of an airplane\u2019s wing causes air to flow at different rates above and below the wing. Slower-moving air below the wing exerts more pressure on it than the faster-moving air above it.\u00a0The pressure difference creates upward lift, allowing planes to counter gravity and fly.",

            "Race cars offer an example of downward lift. This is sometimes called downforce. Race cars often have \u201cwings\u201d mounted on their rears. These wings look different from airplane wings. But like plane wings, they create air pressure differences that lead to lift.",
            "A driver doesn\u2019t want their race car to fly. They want it to hug the road. So the shape of a race car\u2019s wing causes air to move faster under it than over it. The result is higher air pressure above the wing. That\u2019s opposite how airplane wings work, and it helps the car grip tight to the road.",

So you may already know that scratching can feel good at the time, but may not help in the long run. A study in mice finds that scratching can have both positive and negative effects.",
            "Researchers shared these findings January 31 in Science.",

            "An itch can begin when a substance (such as an oil in poison ivy) activates mast cells. These immune cells release itch signals and kick off inflammation. Scratching boosts that process, the new study suggests.",
            "\u201cThe act of scratching is actually triggering the inflammation by [working] with mast cells to make them more effective,\u201d says Daniel Kaplan. He\u2019s a dermatologist and immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. He also coauthored the new study.",

It\u2019s a lot worse. And I think this could be a mechanism that explains why.\u201d",
            "Now onto the good news. Scratching lessened the amount of potentially harmful bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus) found on the skin of itchy mice. That may be because of a heightened immune reaction that scratching can prompt. ",
