            "Just looking at this picture of a clearly ill person could be activating your immune system.",
            "Just seeing someone who looks sick may trigger our brains and bodies to go into infection-fighting mode.",
            "This finding comes from people who viewed faces in virtual reality. If the faces were of individuals who seemed to be sick, the viewers\u2019 own brains became active in areas that detect threats. Certain immune cells in the viewers\u2019 blood also became active.",
            "A research team in Europe shared the new findings in the September issue of Nature Neuroscience.",
            "This is \u201creally remarkable,\u201d says Michael Irwin, who did not take part in the new work. It\u2019s the first study, he says, to show that just seeing someone who looks sick can rev up our immunity. His own work at the University of California, Los Angeles, has focused on how the brain interacts with our immune system.",
            "For the new study, 248 recruits watched faces approach them in virtual reality. At the same time, researchers monitored brain activity and the blood of these viewers.",
            "Some avatars showed signs of sickness, such as coughing or rashes. Others appeared fearful or neutral. Some study participants saw sick-looking avatars entering their personal space. They reacted faster to their face being touched, researchers found. That faster reaction suggests these participants were on the alert.",
            "Brain regions that monitor personal space reacted differently to sick faces than to other ones. A brain circuit that detects important events in the environment also turned on.",
            "\u201cThese two systems were activated differently by a sick avatar,\u201d says Andrea Serino. They were different even from a \u201cfearful\u201d avatar. That suggests the concern was about infection, he says, not threats in general. Serino is a neuroscientist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. He coauthored the new study.",
            "*a_kid_wearing_a_VR_headset",
            "fCFor the new study, participants did not actually encounter sick- and healthy-looking individuals. To protect their health, they actually \u201cviewed\u201d these people via a virtual-reality headset. At the same time they were seeing people, researchers recorded how various parts of their brains responded. ",
            "Certain immune cells in the blood also grew more active in people who saw sick faces. These innate lymphoid cells are one of the immune system\u2019s first responses to a threat. They sound an alarm to other immune cells.",
            "Camilla Jandus is an immunologist at the University of Geneva, in Switzerland. She says she wouldn\u2019t have expected that activation unless or until a pathogen got into the body.",
            "Serino and Jandus were part of a team that compared changes in these people to how the human body reacts to a flu vaccine. That vaccine turns on lymphoid cells similarly to what occurred in people who saw sick avatars, says Jandus. This shows that their bodies responded in much the way they do to being infected with germs.",
            "This discovery might one day be used to boost how well vaccines work. Or it could help certain drugs work better by upping the immune system\u2019s response, Serino says.",
            "First, researchers need to better understand what\u2019s going on. The new study measured only two types of immune cells. And they saw no change in the second type, called natural killer cells.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The immune system is very complex. Much of what it does remains unknown. This study\u2019s analysis of what happened to the immune response is fairly simple, says Filip Swirski. \u201cA lot more should be done to look at this more thoroughly,\u201d he says. An immunologist in New York City, Swirski works at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.",
            "The European group is already working on this. They want to know how long the effects last after seeing a sick face. They also have begun monitoring more cells and molecules.",
            "The current study only focused on young adults. Whether the same thing happens in older people hasn\u2019t been tested. Age, sex and ethnic background may all affect how the body responds, Irwin points out. \u201cAll those factors need to be taken into account.\u201d",

            "Female divers at Jeju Island in South Korea are known as Haenyeo. It means \u201csea women.\u201d They forage for food beneath the waves for two to 10 hours a day. They spend the most time underwater of any humans studied. Indeed, they rival some marine mammals, a new study finds.",
            "On Jeju Island in South Korea live women who dive deep into the East China Sea. There, they harvest sea urchins and shellfish. Known as Haenyeo, or sea women, they spend more time underwater than any other humans studied. That\u2019s one to five hours a day.",
            "Researchers shared their findings August 18 in Current Biology.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s as close as you get to studying a mermaid,\u201d says Chris McKnight. He\u2019s a marine-mammal biologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.",
            "McKnight is part of a team that worked with seven Haenyeo divers. Over 1,786 dives, these women wore devices that monitored how long they stayed underwater. The devices also measured how deep the women dove. They even tracked oxygen levels in the women\u2019s brains and muscles.",
            "The women dove repeatedly for two to 10 hours each day. And they spent an average of 56 percent of that time beneath the surface. This is more time than many aquatic mammals spend underwater, the researchers say. That includes beavers, polar bears and sea otters.",
            "Chronicles of female divers in this part of Asia date back 3,000 years. Researchers have studied some of these divers in the lab. McKnight\u2019s team wanted to monitor them in a real-life setting. This new study put the women\u2019s abilities into context with other water-dwelling mammals. Such research could shed light on how the ancestors of whales and other marine mammals transitioned from land to water, McKnight says.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The team expected to see low oxygen levels and slow heart rates in the Haenyeo. That\u2019s how other mammals have adapted to diving. Instead, it was the opposite. These women had elevated heart rates. And oxygen levels in their brain and muscles barely decreased while diving.",
            "This surprise might be explained by the style of the women\u2019s dives. They don\u2019t make long, deep dives, like a whale might. Instead, dives by these women range from one to three meters (three to 15 feet) deep. They average just 11 seconds in length. These women make lots of dives, surfacing for an average of only nine seconds before diving again.",
            "What makes their feats even more impressive is the divers\u2019 average age: 70. \u201cThis speaks to an incredible health span,\u201d says study coauthor Melissa Ilardo. She\u2019s an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. That \u201cis really exciting, because we could really dig into what\u2019s allowing that to be possible in this population,\u201d she says.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Ilardo led a lab-based study that compared the Haenyeo women with non-diving Koreans. The study uncovered genetic variations in the Haenyeo. Those variations were associated with their blood pressure as well as their ability to withstand cold water. That may contribute to skillful diving. Ilardo and her colleagues reported this on May 27 in Cell Reports.",
            "McKnight says that the Haenyeo also may have adapted to tolerate high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). This gas builds up in the body after repeated breath holds. Elevated CO2 levels are \u201cincredibly uncomfortable\u201d for most people, McKnight notes. They can cause anxiety and panic. He hopes to monitor the women\u2019s CO2 levels in the future.",
            "The Haenyeo\u2019s foraging practices are similar to \u201ca surface-oriented, shallow-diving marine mammal like a sea otter,\u201d says Ted Cheeseman. A marine biologist, he heads Happywhale. It\u2019s an online photo database of marine mammals. He did not take part in the new study. Adaptations that allow these women to spend more than half their time underwater \u201creally speaks to culture driving evolution,\u201d Cheeseman says."

That\u2019s when divers view sharks underwater while inside a protective cage. Martinez was mostly there for the thrill. \u201cI really just wanted to scare [my classmates].\u201d",
            "The boat ride was proving to be a bummer. The waves were choppy. Martinez\u2019s wetsuit didn\u2019t fit. And everyone was feeling seasick. When she entered the ocean, a woman beside her said she felt ill. \u201cAll of a sudden, she pukes,\u201d Martinez recalls. \u201cThen a wave comes, so all that puke just lands on me and my face.\u201d\u00a0",
            "At that moment, a white shark approached the cage. To see the shark, Martinez immediately dived, puke and all. But the sight was worth it, she says. Movies usually show these sharks as bloody predators. But this white shark looked entirely different. \u201cI was shocked at how beautiful the shark was,\u201d she says. \u201cSeeing that white shark was a pivotal moment in my career.\u201d",

Then I saw a documentary on shark conservation called Sharkwater. That film helped me tell the difference between loving something and having a passion for it. I loved psychology and anthropology, but I felt passionate about the ocean.",

I was afraid that they would think everything I\u2019d done so far was a waste of time. My family left Colombia when I was 6 so that I could have a better future. But my dad actually got teary-eyed when I told them about my career change. He explained that he had wanted to study marine biology, too. But the career counselors at his school told him to give up that dream.\u00a0",

People I\u2019d work with during a project would tell me about other opportunities. That often allowed me to pick up different skills. I was working a gig taking pictures of corals for a national park in Thailand when COVID hit. I was stuck there for about five months.\u00a0",
            "I realized that I needed to find something more committed. In 2022, I worked as a research assistant studying whale sharks in the Philippines. That led to my current job working as a ship biologist in Mexico. Becoming a member of the group Minorites in Shark Sciences also catapulted my career. They offer opportunities and support to minorities that they don\u2019t usually get in the sciences. \u00a0",
            "It offers me amazing opportunities to work with different species of sharks. Working with different organizations allows me to really improve my skills. It\u2019s also made me more adaptable. I\u2019m constantly working with new people on different boats. Each team has a different way of doing things. And every boat has its own setup.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "My life can feel really exhausting. Since I\u2019m constantly traveling, I don\u2019t have a place to sleep. My backpack is my home. Earlier this year, I found myself in a new location every week. I\u2019ve been doing this for the past five years or so. It\u2019s unstable, but it\u2019s also worth the sacrifice.\u00a0",

            "For example, clam divers in the Gulf of Mexico have lost their lives to shark encounters. And of course, naturally, their reaction is to hate sharks. A lot of scientists will try to preach or lecture the fishermen about how sharks don\u2019t regularly attack clam divers. But listening to their concerns should be an important part of that work.

            "Our galaxy alone is huge. If we had to take our turn on telescopes all the time, it might take up to 60 years to observe every star once. And that might be something like every star within 100 light-years of us (about 60,000 stars).\u00a0",

The Magic School Bus once got attacked by white blood cells when it shrunk down to explore a sick person\u2019s bloodstream. And Ant-Man is famous for using his shrinking technology in Marvel films and comic books. But will humans ever be able to shrink down like this in real life?\u00a0\u00a0",

Finding the answer can involve looking into the hearts of atoms and the power of the sun.\u00a0",
            "One hypothetical way to shrink something would be to reduce the size of its atoms. Atoms are the building blocks of almost all matter in the universe. Each atom is made up of electrons that surround an atomic nucleus.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "An atom\u2019s size depends on several fundamental constants, including the charge of an electron. Those constants don\u2019t change. Tweaking them would require breaking the laws of physics, says Kakalios. He works at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis and wrote the book The Physics of Superheroes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Atoms come together to build all kinds of molecules. In the first Ant-Man movie, Dr. Hank Pym explains that he made his famous Pym Particles by learning how to reduce the distance between molecules. This, he claims, is what gives Ant-Man\u2019s suit the power to contract down to the size of an ant \u2014 or even smaller.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Atoms and molecules in the human body, though, are already packed closely together. Trying to get them even closer would be challenging.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "You could try to force the atoms together. But Kakalios says that even a tiny reduction in size would require immense amounts of pressure. That would be bad news for any person who tried it on themselves. \u201cThe technical term is \u2018gross,\u2019\u201d Kakalios says. \u201cIt would just smush you, and you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Atoms do get pushed together in our solar system, notes Salvatore Rappoccio. He\u2019s a physicist at the University at Buffalo in New York. To see this in action, just look to our sun. Like all stars, it is powered by fusion. That\u2019s when atomic nuclei are brought together under immense pressure until they form a new atom.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Fusion releases enough energy to make our sun shine. Scientists are trying to re-create this process on Earth to generate power. But it wouldn\u2019t be very useful for shrinking technology. \u201cYou would explode,\u201d Rappoccio says.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Venturing farther into the universe offers extreme examples of what happens when matter is packed very closely together. Black holes form when mass gets packed into a smaller and smaller space until eventually it becomes so dense that nothing \u2014 not even light \u2014 can escape the object\u2019s gravity.\u00a0",
            "Black holes are typically born when massive stars explode and their cores collapse. A black hole has never been created on Earth. But Rappoccio says that in theory, any object could become a black hole \u2014 even a person \u2014 if it were compressed into a small enough space.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Even if you somehow became that dense, though, you\u2019d perish long before you could tell the tale. Creating a shrink ray to squeeze other objects down to an extreme density could also be devastating. In Despicable Me, Gru tried to shrink the moon to steal it. \u201cIn real life, if you try to shrink the moon, it would become a black hole and destroy everything,\u201d Rappoccio says.\u00a0",

            "Shrinking a person\u2019s vocal cords would give them a very high-pitched, and very quiet, voice. And if their mass stayed the same, they would be incredibly heavy for their size. Ant-Man would crush any ant he tried to ride! Puny people might not even be able to see very well. As their eyes shrunk, their ability to process visible wavelengths of light might become worse.",
            "\u201cNone of this is possible,\u201d Kakalios says. But it\u2019s well worth thinking about. \u201cIt\u2019s given me an excuse to talk about real physics that you haven\u2019t noticed. By talking about this superhero ice cream sundae, I sneakily got you to eat your spinach.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Kakalios also notes that the science of making things smaller is not entirely imaginary. Although tech may not be able to shrink people, humans are remarkably adept at shrinking our tech. Without the real-life science of making smaller materials, you wouldn\u2019t be able to read this sentence.\u00a0",
            "Transistors are devices that act as building blocks for your computer, phone and other devices. They allow computers to process information using the numbers \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1.\u201d Electronic machines need a lot of them to work.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "There can be billions of transistors in your phone and in your computer. Each one used to be the size of a person\u2019s fingernail, Kakalios notes. Now, they can be engineered to be even smaller than viruses.\u00a0",
            "This feat of downsizing has given us world-changing modern technologies. And it\u2019s all thanks to the same physics that prevents shrinking technology for people from existing. \u201cThe world is a knowable place,\u201d Kakalios says. \u201cBy figuring out the rules by how the world works, we can then use these rules to make our lives better.\u201d\u00a0",

Under a microscope, each one looks a bit like a plump caterpillar, wriggling around on eight legs tipped with dainty clawed feet. But don\u2019t let their cuteness fool you. These salt grain\u2013sized animals are some of the toughest beasts on Earth.",

They have been known to survive hundreds of times the X-ray radiation that would kill a human. And they\u2019ve even withstood getting blasted out of a gun at more than 1,800 miles per hour. Basically, tardigrades are the ultimate extremophiles.",
            "Why did these wee creatures evolve to be so durable? Some 1,300 species of tardigrades have been found. They thrive in ponds, streams and damp soil and clumps of moss. Many of those places can dry out in the summer. So tardigrades need ways to survive being parched. Adaptations they evolved to survive dehydration may have bestowed tardigrades with the power to survive other harsh conditions.",
            "For instance, water bears make a special protein that could shield their DNA from damage when their cells get dehydrated. This protein may also protect their DNA from radiation damage. Similarly, water bears make proteins that act like tiny packing peanuts to keep their cells from collapsing as they dry out. Those same proteins might help the critters\u2019 cells hold up against a deep freeze.",

            "Rose petals\u2019 distinct shape is actually the result of geometric stress.",
            "Would a rose by any other shape smell as sweet? Maybe. Yet the shape of a rose is part of its beauty \u2014 and why these flowers fascinate scientists.",
            "As they grow, the petals on a rose take on a distinct shape. Each one molds itself into a curved cup with points called cusps. At a glance, these petals may not look much different from those of other flowers. But scientists have now discovered that mathematically, the shape of a rose petal is different from that of other blooms.",
            "To know how a petal develops its shape, you need to understand its underlying math, says Eran Sharon. He\u2019s a physicist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He was part of a team that worked on the new research.",
            "The shape of a rose arises because the flower gets \u201cfrustrated\u201d as it grows, Sharon and his coworkers reported May 1 in Science. This discovery may inspire engineers to design new self-shaping materials for robots and electronics.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Outside forces shape most solid structures. Think of a building. Engineers must use supports and add materials such as concrete during its construction.",
            "Plants, in contrast, are self-shaping. But the way a plant naturally tends to grow is not always allowed by the laws of physics, says Michael Moshe. A coauthor of the work, he\u2019s also a physicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.",
            "When some force gets in the way of a plant growing into its preferred shape, this is called an incompatibility. And it can stress a plant.",
            "Many plants have what\u2019s known as Gauss incompatibility. It\u2019s named for the 19th-century mathematician who discovered it: Carl Friedrich Gauss. This incompatibility arises when different parts of a plant grow at different rates. It may be the edge of a leaf growing faster than its center. The petals of carnation flowers and certain seed pods reduce this stress by forming a wavy edge.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_white_carnation_in_bloom_against_a_black_background",
            "fC\u201cGauss incompatibility\u201d causes the petals of some blooms \u2014 such as this carnation \u2014 to form wavy edges. ",
            "In the past, scientists assumed that a rose\u2019s shape arose the same way. But the sharp points of rose petal\u2019s cusps look quite different from the smooth ruffles of carnations. So Sharon, Moshe and their coworkers suspected some other geometry was at play.",
            "\u201cBy cutting small segments out of [rose petals] and looking at them in their relaxed shape, you can conclude what [shape] it wants to be,\u201d explains Sharon.",
            "\u201cWhen we did that \u2026 the Gauss requirements were fulfilled,\u201d he says. That is, rose petals\u2019 preferred growth pattern would not lead to the same types of stress seen in plants with Gauss incompatibility.",
            "So, what causes a rose petal\u2019s iconic shape?",
            "To solve this mystery, the team ran a few experiments. They examined real rose petals, plastic replicas and computer models of petals. A different type of incompatibility better explained the rose\u2019s shape, they found. It\u2019s called MCP (for Mainardi-Codazzi-Peterson) incompatibility.",
            "Unlike the Gauss type, this type depends mainly on a shape\u2019s curvature. A rose petal does not maintain a smooth curve across its surface. As a result, a petal growing on a rose cannot maintain a smooth shape without tearing or folding. This MCP incompatibility leads to very specific points of stress.",
            "On rose petals, that stress is expressed by forming sharp folds in the form of cusps.",
            "*a_composite_of_two_photos,_on_the_left_is_a_real_rose_petal,_and_on_the_right_is_a_manufactured_peta",
            "fCTo understand the shape of a rose petal, researchers studied 100 examples \u2014 both real (left) and fake (right).",
            "To confirm this, the researchers designed replica petals with that incompatibility baked into them. These took on the exact shape of real rose petals. \u201cThis proved [MCP] is completely sufficient to explain the shape,\u201d Sharon says.",
            "This is a \u201cbeautiful example\u201d of how physics and geometry can offer insight into living tissues, says Suraj Shankar. He did not take part in the study. He does, however, study physics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.",
            "The new work also may have uses beyond understanding living things, he adds. Roses\u2019 self-shaping traits could inspire materials for soft robots and flexible electronics.",
            "\u201cIt is hard to predict what specific applications will emerge,\u201d says Benny Davidovitch. He\u2019s a physicist at University of Massachusetts Amherst. \u201cIt is very likely that beyond the aesthetic value of this work,\u201d he says, \u201cthere will be real-world applications.\u201d",
            "At the end of the day, this work also shows just how interesting geometry can be, says Moshe \u2014 and how it can show up in the most unexpected places. \u201cI think geometry is attractive because the questions are intuitive,\u201d Moshe says. \u201cBut many times, the consequences are surprising and beautiful.\u201d",

And sleeping in on the weekend may reduce anxiety, a new study finds \u2014 as long as teens don\u2019t tack on more than two extra hours of shut-eye.",
            "It might seem like a good idea to get as much sleep as possible on the weekend. Sleep is essential for a fully functioning brain and body \u2014 especially for adolescents. And 75 percent of American teens don\u2019t get the recommended eight to 10 hours per night. School, homework and other weekday activities require them to rise early. Teens\u2019 circadian rhythm also makes it difficult to fall asleep before 11 p.m.",
            "Yet past research has hinted that too much sleep on the weekend can lead to health issues. Those studies had found a possible connection between catch-up sleep and depression. But the link hadn\u2019t been carefully studied. What\u2019s more, no one had looked at another major aspect of mental health \u2014 anxiety \u2014 in relation to sleep.",
            "That got Sojeong Kim curious. Kim is a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Oregon in Eugene. She set out to investigate how catch-up sleep might be related to anxiety.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Kim used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. This study has \u00a0been following thousands of kids and teens from across the United States to learn how their brains develop over time.",
            "For her study, Kim focused on data collected from teens when they were 12 to 15 years old. That\u2019s around the age that people start having trouble getting enough sleep, she explains. It\u2019s \u201charder for teens to fall asleep early and wake up in the morning.\u201d",
            "The data included sleep and activity patterns for nearly 1,900 young people. These data came from a Fitbit each participant wore during the study. Participants had also filled out questionnaires about their feelings of anxiety and depression. Kim studied those, too.",
            "Teens who slept in on weekends reported the lowest symptoms of anxiety, but only if they got less than two hours of extra shut-eye.

            "Anxious teens experienced neck tension \u2014 a common sign of stress. They also reported excessive worries, fears and guilt.",
            "Kim shared her findings at the SLEEP 2025 conference in Seattle, Wash., on June 11.",
            "\u201cThe results show a possible link between sleeping a little more on weekends and feeling less anxious,\u201d says Christopher Depner. \u201cBut we still need more research to know for sure.\u201d Depner, who was not involved in the work, studies sleep and circadian rhythms at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
            "One limit of the new research is that it was an observational study, Depner says. An observational study is one where researchers simply observe something happening in the world. They don\u2019t set up an experiment and control variables to test a hypothesis about how it works.",
            "\u201cThe scientists just watched how people sleep without asking them to try any new sleep habits or treatments,\u201d Depner points out. Having people follow different sleep schedules and then measuring their mental health could help clarify how one affects the other.",

            "Like jet lag triggered by traveling between time zones, social jet lag causes grogginess and a foggy brain. It happens when our body\u2019s clock is out of sync with our sleep cycle. Switching from too little sleep to too much is a known trigger. Although Kim\u2019s study didn\u2019t investigate this as a cause, she suspects it\u2019s part of the problem.",
            "Kim didn\u2019t find a clear link between catch-up sleep and symptoms of depression. That might be due to the age group Kim studied. \u201cUsually, depressive symptoms onset later in adolescence,\u201d she says. Anxiety, on the other hand, tends to start when teens are younger. Kim\u2019s next step is to study weekend catch-up sleep among older teens.",
            "For now, she wants teens to know there can be benefits to catch-up sleep. \u201cGetting a little extra sleep on weekends might help [you] feel less anxious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not too much, because it can give you the opposite effect.\u201d"

            "With their humanlike digestive tracts, vampires would probably starve in real life. That\u2019s because our bodies evolved to rely on a wide array of foods that includes vegetables, meat and grains. ",
            "Vampires have been stalking the human imagination for centuries. These fictional creatures take many forms, including the famous Count Dracula and Morbius of the Marvel Universe. But most share one feature: long, razor-sharp teeth. These fangs help vampires bite the necks of victims to feast on their blood.",
            "Many real bloodthirsty creatures exist in nature. Vampire bats are perhaps the most famous. Mosquitoes and ticks also make the list, as do some spiders and moths. But it would be hard to turn a human body \u2014 even an undead one \u2014 into a blood-drinking monster.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe can\u2019t survive the way vampires do,\u201d says David Begun. This paleoanthropologist studies how apes, including humans, evolved. He works at the University of Toronto in Canada. In real life, no primates survive on blood, Begun notes. To do so, vampires would need to rework both the mouths and guts that humans inherited from our plant-eating ancestors.",
            "In popular media, vampires puncture skin using knifelike upper canine teeth. Humans occasionally use their canines to tear food, too. But any vampire would probably struggle to reliably break skin. \u201cOur canines are completely unsuited to piercing anything,\u201d says Begun. \u201cThey look more like incisors, our front teeth.\u201d",
            "Human canines have slowly shrunk over time. Like many primates today \u2014 including our close cousins, chimpanzees and gorillas \u2014 our ancestors once sported large, pointed canines. These impressive teeth would have even sharpened themselves by rubbing against neighboring molars.",
            "But anthropologists suspect that these flashy teeth weren\u2019t primarily for eating. Instead, ancient apes probably used them to intimidate rivals and defend themselves. Over time, these teeth grew smaller as our ancestors evolved to live in cooperative groups. Less fighting between males left little need for such large canines.",
            "Vampires would have to revert to big canines, says Begun. Those teeth would also need to be much sharper, more like the teeth of the only real blood-drinking mammals: vampire bats.\u00a0",
            "These blood sippers use their two front incisors to create tiny incisions in their prey. Unlike human teeth, these incisors don\u2019t have enamel. This allows them to remain permanently sharp and to not wear down over time. \u201cNo primate has such sharp canines that would allow that kind of thing to happen,\u201d says Begun.\u00a0",
            "*A_close-up_image_shows_a_common_vampire_bat_face_The_bat_sports_brown_fur,_pointed_ears_and_small_bl",
            "fCUnlike their fictional counterparts, vampire bats (such as the one seen here) don\u2019t suck blood. Instead, these nocturnal predators use their upper incisors to pierce skin. Saliva containing anticoagulants then enters the wound, which prevents blood from clotting. The small bats then use their tongues to lap up the oozing blood. ",
            "Even movies that show vampires growing sharp canines at will would be unrealistic. If taken care of, our permanent teeth don\u2019t change much over the course of our lives. Instead, the size, number and shape of our teeth are all preset by our genes.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cThere are rodents that have continuously growing incisors,\u201d says Begun. Beavers, squirrels and rats are a few examples. \u201cBut they can\u2019t do it at will.\u201d In fact, these rodents must grind their teeth or gnaw on hard items such as wood and bone to keep them short. If left unchecked, overgrown incisors can interfere with eating, injure their mouths and even grow through their skulls.",
            "Finding ways to draw blood from victims isn\u2019t the only hurdle real-life vampires would face. They\u2019d also need to be able to digest it \u2014 and use that food as fuel for their undead activities.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Blood isn\u2019t particularly nutritious. Low in calories, it\u2019s mostly made up of water and protein. Because of their humanlike guts, any vampire would probably suffer from malnutrition or even poisoning.\u202f",
            "\u201cHumans can\u2019t survive on blood alone,\u201d says Begun. \u201cWe need a lot more diversity of nutrients, of vitamins and minerals, that aren\u2019t present in blood.\u201d\u00a0",
            "That\u2019s because we inherited our digestive systems from a long line of omnivores, or animals that eat both plants and other animals. Like today\u2019s chimpanzees, our ape ancestors would\u2019ve likely eaten mostly plants with an occasional helping of meat, says Begun. Long, coiled intestines probably helped them break down tough plants. And bacteria in their guts likely helped further digest this food and absorb nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "By about 2.5 million years ago, our ancestors started eating more meat. Later, humans started cooking with fire. That made digesting foods such as meat and tough plants much easier. Even more recently, people began growing starches such as grains to eat.\u00a0",
            "This led to tweaks in our digestive tracts. We started producing extra enzymes that could break down starches. Meat and other easy-to-digest foods could be broken down in shorter intestines. This resulted in bodies best suited to eating many different foods, says Begun.\u00a0",
            "Even vegans who don\u2019t eat any animal products must have a varied diet. \u201cThey can\u2019t just eat lettuce all day long,\u201d Begun says. \u201cThey have to have beans. They have to have rice. They have to have complete proteins.\u201d ",
            "While low in most nutrients, blood does contain lots of iron.\u00a0Red blood cells hold about 70 percent of the iron in our bodies, where it helps carry oxygen to organs. But consuming too much iron can be toxic to humans, who have no way to digest or excrete large amounts of it. This iron overload can damage body organs, the nervous system and even cause death.",
            "Unlike humans, vampire bats have evolved ways to digest blood. Research suggests that vampire bats lost a gene that blocks intestinal cells from absorbing too much iron. Those gut cells are also short-lived and regularly shed. This lets the bats quickly absorb lots of iron and discard it through their waste. Meanwhile, their gut bacteria help break down proteins. These microbes may also produce extra vitamins not found in blood.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Scientists are still trying to understand why vampire bats started feeding on blood. Some suspect the habit arose from bats that fed on parasites such as ticks. Perhaps the bats eventually started feeding on the blood oozing from wounds left behind when they scarfed down these pests.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Whatever led bats to their taste for blood, it\u2019s clear humans weren\u2019t shaped by those same evolutionary pressures. And changing how a real species eats usually requires tens of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution. That\u2019s a lot more involved than the single bite needed to make a fictional vampire.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Still, this reality shouldn\u2019t stop movie-goers from enjoying vampires, Begun says. \u201cIt\u2019s still OK to enjoy a vampire movie or a vampire TV show, even if it\u2019s not actually feasible.\u201d"

            "Much food packaging contains phthalates, chemicals added to make a plastic flexible. New data suggest that one phthalate, known as DEHP, could be responsible for more than one in every eight recent deaths from cardiovascular disease.",
            "A common ingredient of many plastics has just been linked to a high risk of death from diseases of the heart and blood vessels.",
            "The chemical is known as DEHP. That\u2019s short for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. It\u2019s a member of a family of chemicals used widely in our daily lives. Indeed, all of us carry trace levels of DEHP and other phthalates (THAA-laytz) in our bodies.",
            "These chemicals are often added to plastics to make them softer and more flexible. DEHP, a very common member of this family, shows up in a huge range of everyday products, such as shower curtains, raincoats, toys, car upholstery and shoes. It\u2019s also in food packaging and medical supplies (including blood bags).",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/3ROqQkpnMoA?feature=oembed",
            "See the broad range of products that contain DEHP and the many health effects that have been linked to this phthalate.",
            "Leonardo\u00a0Trasande and his team at New York University\u2019s medical school in New York City probed for a possible link between DEHP and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The leading cause of death worldwide, CVD includes all diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Among them: clogged arteries (a source of heart attacks), stroke, heart failure and more.",
            "To start, the NYU team gathered estimates on DEHP exposures across the globe. These data came from 216 studies published between 2000 and 2023. The studies measured, in people\u2019s bodies, amounts of chemicals made when DEHP breaks down. Called metabolites, such chemicals indicate how much DEHP people were exposed to.",
            "Next, the team looked at how CVD deaths and DEHP exposures had changed over the years. They compared DEHP data from 2008 with death rates from CVD 10 years later among people 55 to 64 years old. From this, they calculated what share of those deaths globally seemed to trace to this phthalate.",
            "More than 2.6 million CVD deaths were recorded for this age group in 2018. The new study links 13.5 percent of them to this plasticizer.",
            "The new data do not prove DEHP caused all of these deaths. The NYU team only found a link between the two. That\u2019s a correlation \u2014 not proof yet that it caused these deaths. However, if the link is shown to be causal, that would be quite troubling: It would come to more than one in every eight CVD deaths worldwide.",
            "Another caution: People encounter a mix of phthalates daily. In the new study, however, \u201cour model was not able to take this into account,\u201d says Sara Hyman of the NYU team. The group\u2019s analysis also didn\u2019t account for other factors that might play a role in heart disease, such as diet, exercise or other medical conditions. \u201cMore research is needed,\u201d she says, to also account for these.",
            "The NYU group shared its findings in the July issue of eBioMedicine.",

            "Changcheng Zhou is a biomedical scientist at the University of California, Riverside, who studies what causes cardiovascular disease. And he finds the death rate being linked to DEHP \u201cquite alarming.\u201d",
            "That rate varied greatly across the globe. About three in every four of those deaths linked to DEHP occurred in the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific. That might be due to the large and growing plastics industries in those parts of the world, the NYU team suggests.",
            "Future studies could refine these estimates further, the scientists say. Some national health surveys collect data on phthalate exposures. This is true in the United States, Canada and many nations in Europe. Elsewhere, such as in Latin America, Africa and Asia, such national monitoring is lacking, Hyman says. So her team\u2019s estimates of DEHP exposure in those places are based on far fewer people. As such, she notes, links to DEHP in these places might be slightly less precise.",
            "Different phthalates may affect different processes in the body. And they might not operate alone. \u201cYou do need to study the effect of the mixture\u201d of phthalates people encounter regularly, says Mahua Choudhury. She studies environmental risks to our genes at Texas A&M University in College Station. Some phthalates, she notes, could lessen \u2014 or worsen \u2014 the health effects of others.",

            "Phthalates can enter the body when you eat food that had been sold, stored or heated in plastic. We also breathe them in from the air and absorb them through the skin. Once inside the body, they can tinker with hormone action. Previous research has also linked phthalates to diabetes, obesity, pregnancy complications \u2014 and yes, heart disease.",
            "Also quite troubling: One 2020 study linked pregnant moms\u2019 DEHP exposure with mental risks in their children \u2014 such as a lower IQ. Another study linked school-age kids\u2019 exposures to DEHP with a lower IQ \u2014 especially in boys. A more limited IQ risk emerged for dibutyl phthalate (DBP). It\u2019s another plasticizer and solvent. It\u2019s used widely in making PVC plastic, inks, adhesives and cosmetics.",
            "Prenatal exposure to DEHP and DBP also has been linked with lowering a boy\u2019s preference for certain types of play, such as playing with toy guns. It also made boys more likely to engage in gender-neutral types of play \u2014 think puzzles or sports. No such change was seen in girls.",
            "The new NYU study\u2019s findings offer yet another reason to reduce our use of plastics, researchers say. \u201cWe\u2019re going to become the plastic planet,\u201d Zhou worries. \u201cWe need to start to really address this serious issue.\u201d",

            "Every Nobel Prize winner receives a gold medal, which has the face of Alfred Nobel on one side, and a cash prize. Nobel Prizes honor discoveries in three scientific areas: chemistry, physics, and medicine or physiology.",
            "Katalin Karik\u00f3 thought the call was a joke. It was 3 a.m. on October 2, 2023. Her husband answered the phone. As someone who maintains buildings, \u201che quite frequently gets calls for fixing this and that,\u201d Karik\u00f3 says. But this time he handed it over. \u201cIt is for you,\u201d he said.",
            "Only half awake, Karik\u00f3 heard a scientist from Sweden congratulate her: Karik\u00f3 had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.",
            "Karik\u00f3 works at the University of Szeged in Hungary. She also works at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where she had been asleep that day in October. A biochemist, she has spent much of her career studying messenger RNA. This molecule carries instructions from a cell\u2019s DNA so they can be translated into proteins.",
            "Karik\u00f3 and her colleague Drew Weissman learned how to tweak that RNA. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, their findings allowed other scientists to leap into action. In less than a year, scientist teams made a vaccine using mRNA. So thanks to Karik\u00f3, you may have gotten a vaccine to protect you from COVID-19.",
            "This work definitely sounds worthy of a big prize. And the Nobel is the biggest science prize of them all. Winners receive a solid gold medal imprinted with the face of Alfred Nobel (more on him later). They also get a large cash prize to split among as many as three scientists in each field.",
            "In 2024, the 11 million Swedish kroner prize was valued at about $1 million U.S. (Karik\u00f3 shared this prize with Weissmann, also a biochemist at the University of Pennsylvania.) Every year, the Nobel Foundation awards prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. Sweden\u2019s central bank also gives a prize in economics.",
            "The Nobel Prize is more than a gold paperweight and a nice chunk of money, though. It\u2019s a sign that someone and their work are very important.",

In this image from the event are several Nobel laureates (from left): Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov (chemistry), Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman (physiology or medicine) and Jon Fosse (literature).",
            "Scientists who win a Nobel Prize are famous while they\u2019re alive \u2014 and that fame will live on in history books for years after. This may lead others to care what the winners think \u2014 even in areas where the scientists might not be experts.",
            "But Nobel Prizes spotlight only a narrow slice of science \u2014 and very few scientists.",
            "Many fields of science don\u2019t fit the prize categories. And only three people can share one prize, even though hundreds may have worked on a discovery. Most of those others end up unrecognized for their role in prize-winning work.",
            "The Nobel Prizes also tend to honor people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 in wealthy countries.",
            "Prizes can be important. They may inspire young scientists. The hubbub around these prizes tells the general public that science matters. But the scientists who choose the winners are human and bring their own values and biases to the process. So which scientists get celebrated \u2014 and which don\u2019t \u2014 can be political and sometimes biased. \u00a0",
            "These prizes are named for Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist in the 1800s. His most famous invention was dynamite. He designed the explosive to help build railroads more safely and to tunnel through rocks while mining. But it also was soon used for war and violence. Over time, Nobel grew fabulously wealthy from dynamite and his other inventions.",
            "Nobel had planned to leave his fortune to relatives. But in 1888, his brother, Ludvig, died. At the time, a newspaper in Paris, France, made a mistake. They printed an obituary for Alfred, not Ludvig. (An obituary is a news story at someone\u2019s death outlining their life and achievements.) This story was titled: \u201cThe merchant of death is dead.\u201d It pointed to how Nobel\u2019s inventions had killed many people in battle.",

            "fCAlfred Nobel invented hundreds of things, including processes for making synthetic rubber and artificial silk. But he was most famous for inventing dynamite, a reliable explosive. ",
            "Nobel never said how he felt about reading his own death notice in the morning paper. But \u201che saw himself described in rather unflattering terms,\u201d says Marshall Lichtman, a physician and teacher. Lichtman, who works at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, wrote a 2017 article on Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Prize.",
            "Seven years after reading his premature obituary, Nobel decided his fortune would fund what has come to be called Nobel Prizes. Sweden, his home country, would choose the winners. Nobel specified that he wanted awards in chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.",
            "Nobel probably didn\u2019t intend for the prize to become like the Olympics of science, Lichtman says. \u201cWhat he was hoping to do, I think, was to provide [winners] with a prize that would allow them to continue this exceptional work.\u201d",
            "The Nobel Prizes quickly became famous. One reason: There weren\u2019t other big prizes like it. And these prizes would be open to everyone. \u201cThat meant that the very best people in the world were going to be recognized,\u201d Lichtman says.",
            "If Nobel\u2019s plan had been to change his reputation, it worked. Now he isn\u2019t known as \u201cthe merchant of death.\u201d Instead, he\u2019s the founder of a prize that makes people think of scientific genius.",
            "Choosing who wins Nobels takes almost a year. It\u2019s a huge honor to be involved, says Juleen Zierath. She\u2019s a physiologist, someone who studies the human body, at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.",
            "She\u2019s also part of the 50-person assembly that works with a smaller committee to choose who wins the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Zierath was the first woman to chair a Nobel committee and remains in the assembly.",
            "Every year, scientists around the world have from September to January to nominate candidates for the Physiology or Medicine prize to the Karolinska Institutet. Nominations for the physics and chemistry prizes go to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, nominations for the peace prize go to a group in Norway. And nominations for literature go to The Swedish Academy.",
            "Only invited people can submit those nominations. These are very accomplished scientists and previous prize winners. And they cannot nominate themselves. \u00a0",
            "After the nominations come in, a smaller committee gets to work.",
            "To sort through the hundreds of nominations, the committee pulls in more scientists. Experts in what the nominated scientists study will prepare reports describing what the nominees have done. These must be turned in by August. They\u2019ll be evaluated in September. In the meantime, the smaller committee consults back and forth with the 50-person assembly.",
            "\u201cWe are only allowed to award a discovery,\u201d not a person, Zierath explains. \u201cSo we have to sort through who\u2019s been nominated. Are these people the right people? Did they really make a discovery? \u2026 We have to think a lot.\u201d Once the committee has made a short list of especially good candidates, they send it to the assembly.",
            "The final vote for the Physiology or Medicine prize takes place on the first Monday of every October. (Other prizes get voted on later in the week.) It starts at 9 a.m. in Sweden. The voting is kept a tight secret. The voting room has double doors. No one can bring a phone or laptop.",
            "In another room, journalists from all over the world wait to hear the results. But first, each winner gets a call.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The time difference between Sweden and the United States is big. So late-morning decisions in Stockholm result in middle-of-the-night phone calls to U.S. winners. And that call will be just the start.",
            "Soon after Karik\u00f3 received her call in 2023, the three phones in her house began ringing nonstop. By 7 a.m., journalists were knocking on her door. When Karik\u00f3 answered, she got her picture taken still wearing her pajamas.",

            "Winning a Nobel Prize means your life will never be the same, says Victor Ambros. He works at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worchester. A developmental biologist, he studies how organisms grow. And he took home a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2024 for discovering microRNAs. These tiny bits of genetic material help control how cells make proteins.",
            "Nobel\u2019s goal with his prize was to help support scientists with the prize money \u2014 to let them keep doing their work. Ironically, Ambros has less time than ever to do research.",
            "\u201cBefore this, I was working in the lab and doing experiments,\u201d he says. \u201cI have not been able to get back to that.\u201d He is constantly traveling to give talks. Everyone wants to meet a Nobel Prize winner and hear what they have to say. When something changes in the world of science, journalists want to know what Ambros thinks.",
            "\u201cNobody would have called me before,\u201d he says. (Now, he even gets recognized while out shopping.)",
            "In a way, the Nobel Prize is famous just because it\u2019s famous. \u201cIf you look at the media attention, there is no other prize worldwide that can compete with [it],\u201d says Nils Hansson. He\u2019s a science historian who studies the Nobel Prize at Heinrich-Heine University in Dusseldorf, Germany.",
            "Journalists tell him that they don\u2019t generally cover science prizes \u2014 except the Nobels. \u201cThe brand of the Nobel is so much bigger and more well known than the laureates,\u201d he notes.",
            "Most scientists \u2014 even very successful ones \u2014 will never win a Nobel Prize. Those who do tend to look a certain way. Most are men and tend to be white. They\u2019re also usually from wealthy places like the United States or Europe.",
            "When Katalin Karik\u00f3 won her Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, she joined the small group of women who have attained a Nobel Prize in a scientific field. Since the first prizes were awarded in 1901, 25 women have been awarded one of these prizes. Polish-French scientist Marie Curie is the only woman to have won two Nobel Prizes: Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911.",
            "(All statistics below are from 1901 to 2024.)",
            "Number of PRIZES awarded 115Number of LAUREATES awarded 229WOMEN LAUREATES 13",

            "In 2023, Karik\u00f3 became one of only 13 women to have received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Even fewer have won in chemistry or physics.",
            "The assemblies work hard to avoid bias, says Zierath. \u201cWe\u2019re 50 members on this assembly \u2026 to ensure it is not one person [making] a decision,\u201d she explains. And \u201cwe\u2019re not restricting our nominations to only one region,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching people throughout the world and requesting that they nominate.\u201d",
            "But most of these awards in science still go to people from the United States or Europe. That\u2019s largely because these regions have long invested in funding science and encouraging people to become scientists, Zierath notes. However, bias \u2014 preferring one type of person or country or discovery over another \u2014 can creep into decision-making. The assembly knows this. \u201cOne way to try to deal with biases is to identify that you have them,\u201d she says.",
            "To be seen as prizeworthy, scientists have to make big discoveries. Often, this means working in big labs at important universities. This can be hard to do if someone comes from a low-income area or country, is a member of a minority or faces other challenges.",
            "People of color or white women face a lot of barriers to succeeding in science, notes Harriet Zuckerman. She\u2019s a sociologist \u2014 someone who studies how people behave together \u2014 at Columbia University in New York City. There\u2019s an \u201carray of obstacles that line the course of women\u2019s careers,\u201d she says. These \u201cmake it less likely\u201d for them to reach a place where they can do the type of work likely to win a prize.",
            "\u201cIn order to get the Nobel Prize, normally it takes \u2014 from the first nomination until you get the prize \u2014 10, 20, 30 or even 40 years,\u201d notes Hansson. \u201cSo you have to have a group of friends around you that nominates you all the time, over and over again.\u201d As a result, that prize might recognize work done at a time when even fewer women and people of color were at the top of science than there are today.",
            "And of course, of the impressive scientists considered, only three people can win for any discovery. Those scientists are most often the heads of their labs. Others who work in the labs may go unrecognized.",
            "Ambros, for example, won the 2024 Nobel Prize with collaborator Gary Ruvkun. Ruvkun is a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass. But Ambros\u2019 wife, Rosalind Lee, is a scientist, too. She manages Ambros\u2019 lab and contributed just as much to the work. She, however, did not share the Nobel Prize.",
            "\u201cHere\u2019s a life partner, [my] partner at home, [my] partner in the lab, [my] science partner,\u201d Ambros says. \u201cIt would have been \u2026 terrific, right, if we could have shared\u201d the prize.",

            "The Nobel Foundation is unlikely to change anything about these prizes. They are largely bound by limits that Alfred Nobel wrote into his will, such as: Three or fewer scientists per prize. Only discoveries are awarded. And in science, only discoveries in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine will be considered.",
            "That leaves out a lot of science. \u201cWhere does ecology fit in?\u201d asks Robert Marc Friedman, a historian of science at the University of Oslo in Norway. Or the study of oceans? Weather and climate? Geology? Discoveries in these fields can be just as important as those in physics, chemistry or medicine. But most won\u2019t qualify for a Nobel Prize.",
            "People also shouldn\u2019t make the mistake that all Nobel Prize winners are geniuses on everything, Friedman says. Doing great work in physics, for example, doesn\u2019t mean a scientist may know anything about politics or medicine. In fact, it may only mean they know a lot about one area of physics.",
            "Still, Lichtman thinks that the Nobel Prize is important. It shines a light on science as a whole. \u201cThe average person doesn\u2019t sit at home and say, \u2018Boy, I hope there are a lot of good people going into chemistry or going into physics,\u2019\u201d he says. The Nobel Prize shows the world that science can change our lives.",
            "Ambros agrees \u2014 and not just because he won one. \u201cIt\u2019s all about science and celebrating science,\u201d he notes. \u201cI\u2019ve talked more about my research publicly in the last couple of months than I did in my whole previous career.\u201d When people have heard he won the Nobel Prize, they don\u2019t only get curious about him and his work \u2014 they get curious about science.",

But\u00a0a second version of the model, AlphaFold2, was even better.\u00a0It worked nearly as well as the gold-standard method for figuring out protein structures.

            "This small gold medal is a Nobel Prize. Each medal bears the face of Alfred Nobel.\u00a0",
            "Every year, in the first week of October, a very few lucky scientists get a phone call. For some, the phone rings in the middle of the night. For others, the middle of the day. On the other end of the line is someone with a Swedish accent who informs them they have won a Nobel Prize. Almost instantly, these individuals become celebrities. They will give talks, go to fancy parties and meet the King of Sweden. \u00a0",
            "But why is it such a big deal?",
            "The awards are named for an inventor, Alfred Nobel. During his life, this man was best known for inventing dynamite, a type of explosive. It made him a wealthy man. And when he died in 1896, Nobel left money from his fortune to establish five yearly awards \u2014 the Nobel Prizes.",
            "Nobel\u2019s will directed that one award go to recognize outstanding literature. Another should reward the fostering of international peace. Nobel also wanted to reward scientific discovery. So three awards would celebrate discoveries or inventions in physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine. All five awards would come with a cash prize. That prize is now about 11 million Swedish krona (around $1 million, depending on the exchange rate in any given year). If there are two winners in a category, they split the money equally. If there are three, one person gets half the money, and the other two split the other half.",
            "Every year, thousands of scientists around the world are invited to nominate people for a Nobel Prize. (No one can nominate themselves.) Groups at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden, evaluate nominees for the physics and chemistry prizes. A panel at the Karolinska Institute, a medical university in Stockholm, reviews nominations for the prize in medicine or physiology. These groups narrow the list of candidates. Their short lists then move on to a selection committee for each subject. Those committees vote on who will receive the prize that year \u2014 or whether no one should receive it.",
            "The first set of Nobel Prizes was handed out in 1901. Now, the Nobel Prize \u201cis reckoned the world championship of science. It\u2019s the most prestigious prize worldwide,\u201d says Nils Hansson. He is a medical historian at the Heinrich-Heine University in Dusseldorf, Germany. Winners, he notes, \u201care celebrated like stars, and their research gets a lot of attention.\u201d",
            "The Nobel Prize began to gather fame almost from the start. The winning scientist received more money than any other prize at the time, notes Robert Friedman. He is a science historian at the University of Oslo in Norway.",
            "*a_photo_of_Alfred_Nobel's_will",
            "fCThis is Alfred Nobel\u2019s will. In it, he says his money should be used to give \u201cprizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.\u201d",
            "The prize is also notable for being international. These awards can go to scientists anywhere, not just in Nobel\u2019s home country of Sweden. The prize became \u201ca way in which nations could compete peacefully,\u201d Friedman says.",
            "As a result, the Nobel Prize received a lot of media attention. \u201cFrom the beginning, the main scientific journals wrote about the Nobels,\u201d Hansson says. Now, Nobel Prize winners are front page news.",
            "The Nobel Prize helped to make some scientists household names, observes Harriet Zuckerman. She is a sociologist \u2014 someone who studies the social behaviors of people \u2014 at Columbia University in New York City. \u201cIt calls attention to science, which is to my mind as worthy as filmmaking and pop music \u2014 the things that most people tend to give a lot of value,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also calls attention to people who do not necessarily come from families of great wealth. [They] succeed because they are driven by a desire to work hard and a desire to make a contribution.\u201d",
            "With a few exceptions, the Nobel Prizes have honored good science, not pseudoscientific (SU-doh-sy-en-TIF-ik) fads. A bigger issue is that there are many more impressive scientific achievements than there are Nobel Prizes. \u201cA lot of scientists who do [good] work \u2026 get passed over because there can only be a limited number of winners,\u201d notes Zuckerman.",
            "Even scientists who participated in a discovery might not win a Nobel. The committees that initially set the prize rules decided that a maximum of three people in any category could win each year. Back then, many scientists worked alone or in small groups. But this means that if there was a fourth scientist in a group, they were out of luck. Now, scientists often work in large groups to make major discoveries. In a team of 100, which three would deserve to share that year\u2019s Nobel Prize?",
            "\u201cIn the early days, the people who made the rules couldn\u2019t have imagined how science would change,\u201d Zuckerman says. \u201cMore than a century has passed, so there\u2019s a historical mismatch between the rules that govern the prize and how science is now.\u201d",
            "This also means that when a committee can\u2019t find just a few scientists to get the credit, no one might get credit at all. For example, many scientists worked on the invention of anesthesia. This is the ability to stop someone from feeling pain, or to render them unconscious. Anesthesia completely changed medicine. It let doctors perform delicate surgeries without causing terrible suffering. \u201cMany people worked on the methods,\u201d Hansson says. But for the Nobel Prize, it was too many. The committee for physiology or medicine couldn\u2019t find three people who contributed the most. So no one ever received a Nobel Prize for this achievement.",
            "Also, Nobel Prizes reward achievements in only three scientific areas. In fact, much of science occurs in areas beyond those fields. Say some scientist had figured out how to accurately predict earthquakes. That could save many lives. \u201cIt would perfectly meet the notion of Alfred Nobel to benefit mankind,\u201d Friedman notes. Unfortunately, Earth science is not eligible for a Nobel Prize.",
            "This can be a problem when universities or institutions use the Nobel Prize as a measure of their own importance, Friedman notes. Scientific fields like astronomy or mathematics might not get as much prestige because their scientists can\u2019t win a Nobel.",
            "Some universities put a lot of effort into hiring and keeping Nobel Prize winners. This is something Friedman worries is not good for science. \u201cShould science be like sports, just buying the best guys and getting your rankings?\u201d Nobel Prizes indicate important discoveries, he notes, but \u201cwhat does that say about the university, the quality of life or the quality of [its] teaching?\u201d",
            "Between 1901 and 2024, only 13 of the 229 total winners in physiology or medicine have been women. Only eight women over that period have ever won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Just five have won it in physics. For minority scientists, the numbers are even worse. No black scientist has ever taken home a Nobel Prize.",
            "*a_photo_of_Marie_Curie",
            "fCMarie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and she is still the only woman to have won it twice. She won the physics prize in 1903 and the chemistry prize in 1911.",
            "This lack of diversity is a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the prizes but the reward system of science,\u201d Zuckerman says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a tendency to not recognize the work of people who aren\u2019t from the right countries or the right sex.\u201d Candidates also tend to come from a relatively few universities or research centers, she notes. Among them: the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass.",
            "But things are changing, Zuckerman says. Important scientific societies, such as the National Academy of Sciences in the United States and the Royal Society in the United Kingdom, now let in more women and people of color. These societies help scientists get recognized by their peers. And the more women and minorities that become recognized, the more likely they are to receive a Nobel Prize. Between 1901 and 2001, only 10 women received a Nobel Prize in science. Within the next 15 years, another eight won them. That hardly seems fair, Zuckerman notes, \u201cbut it\u2019s better than it was.\u201d",
            "While Nobel Prize winners have done amazing work, there are many scientists who will never get the golden medal or the big cash prize. Still, the allure of the award remains strong. \u201cI asked freshmen at the California Institute of Technology what the goal was for [their] careers in science,\u201d says Friedman. \u201cNinety percent said their goal was to win a Nobel Prize.\u201d But there are so few Nobel Prizes, most, if not all, of those students will be disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to Las Vegas believing you\u2019ll become a millionaire,\u201d says Friedman.",
            "Not winning a Nobel Prize won\u2019t make those students failures, however. \u201cYes, the brilliant insight of a brilliant scientist is important,\u201d Friedman says. \u201cBut it\u2019s only of importance when you have a community and networks of people working together.\u201d",
            "Editor\u2019s note: This post was updated on October 5, 2022, to revise the number of women who have won Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry. It was updated again on October 4, 2023, to revise the value of the cash award and the numbers of women who have won Nobel prizes in medicine or physiology and physics. It was updated again on October 9, 2024 to update the total number of Nobels awarded in physiology or medicine."

In fact, it can be strong enough to drive chemical reactions in the air.",
            "One day, such micro-sparks could help make some chemicals in a more sustainable way.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve been very interested in the idea of micro-lightning,\u201d says Richard Zare. A chemist, he works at Stanford University in California. His team recently showed sprays of water release tiny sparks that can drive chemical reactions. Now, working with Xinxing Zhang, a physical chemist in China, his team is studying micro-lightning sparked by peeling tape.",
            "fCWatch the glow from electrons jumping as tape is peeled off a roll in the dark.",
            "Using tape was Zhang\u2019s idea. Ripping tape loose from its roll releases visible light. But Zhang knew it also, surprisingly, generates X-rays. He wondered how high this electric charge was and if it sparked chemical reactions. To find out, his team at Nankai University in Tianjin set up an experiment.\u00a0",
            "They started with a roll of sticky tape placed on a bearing. With a motor, they pulled off the tape and wound it around a cylinder. Along the way, the team measured the strength of the electric field that the peeling tape created. They also looked for any changes in the chemistry of the surrounding air.",
            "The test setup pulls tape off a roll and onto a cylinder. A motor controls its speed. The unrolling tape sits on a device (XY translational stage) that can move back and forth. This positions the peeling point in front of a mass spectrometer (Extended MS inlet), which identifies chemicals formed as the zapping triggers air chemicals to react.",

            "fCXufeng Gao",
            "Peeling the tape slowly, at 12.5 centimeters (5 inches) per second, created a small electric field. But when the motor sped up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) per second, the space where the tape left the roll became very highly charged. Zhang\u2019s group tallied a billion volts per meter across this tiny space!",
            "That\u2019s an astonishing voltage \u2014 far beyond what\u2019s usually achieved in the lab, Zare points out. (For perspective, lightning shoots from a storm cloud when the voltage is 3 million volts per meter. In the tape experiment, the high voltage is across too small of a space for the micro-lightning to hurt us.)",
            "The peeling tape\u2019s zap illustrates the triboelectric effect. This is the generation of an electric charge as materials come into contact and then separate. It\u2019s like static electricity, when two objects are rubbed together then moved apart. One object becomes positively charged, meaning it loses electrons. The other gains those lost electrons and becomes negatively charged. (This can make a negatively charged balloon repel electrons from a wall, then \u201cstick\u201d to the positively charged surface. Or, it can send out a tiny zap of electricity.)",
            "The triboelectric effect is at work all around us \u2014 in things as simple as a sliding raindrop and the rustle of our clothes. But the tape experiment created a much higher voltage than most other everyday triboelectric events. Why? Being sticky, the tape peeled off the roll in a jerky way. Scientists call this a \u201cstick\u2013slip\u201d event. It leads to higher charges than when things just rub together or touch.",
            "A high electric field emerged only when the tape was pulled quickly, Zare says. If that electric field is high enough, electrons from the tape will speed up and smash into air molecules or other molecules in the tape. This \u201cleads to a spark that drives chemical reactions,\u201d says Zare. Those electrons flowing between the tape\u2019s surfaces can create a high enough voltage around the tape to break down molecules in the air, he says \u2014 turning them into ions.",
            "Zare\u2019s team repeated what Zhang\u2019s team had done. This time, they also looked to see if molecules of water vapor in the air near the tape would break up and form into new molecules. They did.",
            "Next, Zare\u2019s group put chemicals they suspected would react as vapors in the electric field next to the peeling tape. This was to test a common reaction used in industrial chemistry. (It\u2019s one where pyridine and methyl iodide are reacted to form something new.) Right away, Zare\u2019s group detected new products as these chemicals now reacted.",

But many of the routines might be more harmful than helpful, a new study shows. The majority of the regimens shown are costly, have harmful ingredients and lack sunscreen. Most don\u2019t offer benefits for young skin. And they may lead to skin damage.",

Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",

            "Fins and rudders guide a ship by increasing drag in one place more than in another. This nudges a ship in a desired direction. And dimples might help here, too, says Sareen. She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",
            "They tested these plastic models in wind tunnels to identify how dimple depth affected drag.",
            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/De2VQYkdztM?feature=oembed",
            "Anchal Sareen and her team explain how they used soft robotic technology to develop dynamic surface dimples \u2014 ones that can change at different flow speeds \u2014 to cut the drag experienced by underwater vehicles. It should also allow them to maneuver without fins and rudders.",
            "They\u2019re also developing tests to see if the design would work in real-world conditions, such as the skin of some vessel sailing through air or water.",
            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",
            "\u201dA lot of people have asked me, \u2018Are you planning to patent this as a golf ball which can stay in the air?'\u201d Sareen laughs and says: Not any time soon."

Maybe you\u2019ve seen these pieces of ice laying on the ground after a storm. Their pummeling barrage starts and stops suddenly, seemingly without warning. This is a hailstorm. And it can be a truly impressive spectacle.",
            "Hail forms high in the clouds during a storm. There, some raindrops freeze solid. As more and more raindrops collide, an icy \u201cstone\u201d grows in size until it\u2019s too heavy to remain aloft.",

            "Scientists used to think that hailstones grew by taking a looping path through the atmosphere. Think of their path as upward and downward like a merry-go-round tipped on its side. But such looping motions are actually rare, scientists in China have now shown. They analyzed hailstones collected by citizen scientists.",
            "Since 2016, people had been collecting hailstones across 15 provinces in China. These citizen scientists gathered more than 3,000 of these bits of ice and stored them until people on Qinghong Zhang\u2019s team could retrieve the hail.

The researchers then analyzed the specific isotopes of oxygen present in the frozen water within each layer. By matching that chemistry with the properties of the atmosphere at different heights, they could estimate the paths each ice ball had taken through the sky.",

She\u2019s a hail scientist who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, and works at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, an environmental consulting company.

The researchers have traveled across the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains and the Central Plains.

Trees occur along rivers and streams that may cut through the plains.",

This dry air descends to the plains below and cannot support forests. But it does support grasses, which form the steppe.",

However, once the natural grasses get plowed under, the region can become even drier. Soil nutrients can dwindle without natural vegetation to anchor them in place.

            "Long and Zetian Yang recorded the activity of individual nerve cells in the brains of four parakeets. These cells were nestled in the anterior arcopallium. It sits in a front part of the birds\u2019 brains. The two NYU Langone researchers tracked the activity of cells here as the birds chirped and trilled away. That activity was tied to how the birds made those sounds, they found.",
            "How the activity was organized turns out to be pretty simple, Long says. He compares it to a keyboard. This keyboard can produce a range of sounds \u2014 consonants, vowels, high pitches and low pitches. A parakeet can combine different sounds \u201cby just playing this vocal keyboard,\u201d Long says.",
            "Overall, this brain system is organized in a rather humanlike way.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Similarities between human and parrot brains show how two species can solve a problem in a similar way. This could be \u201ca very tidy example\u201d of what\u2019s known as convergent evolution, Long says. The brains of people and these small parrots both developed ways that let them make a complex series of sounds. But how this happened evolved separately in each species.",
            "Scientists now know more about how the birds\u2019 brains help these parrots talk. But another question remains: What are these birds talking about?",
            "\u201cWe are trying now to translate budgie,\u201d he says of that language.",
            "Long\u2019s team is using advanced machine learning to find patterns among the bird talk. They hope this will help them figure out what each warble and chirp means. Perhaps their language \u2014 not just how the birds\u2019 brains create it \u2014 resembles that in people.",
            "Through these kinds of experiments, Long says, people may come to challenge the idea that complex language is a particularly human behavior. Parakeets might be telling us that people aren\u2019t the sole species with a gift of gab.",

            "A new gadget (illustrated at center) creates an acoustic rainbow. It splits sound (produced at the center of the device) into different pitches (shown here as different colors).",
            "No rainstorm is needed for this new type of rainbow \u2014 it\u2019s made of sounds.",
            "A normal rainbow separates light waves of different hues, or wavelengths. The different colors that make up sunlight fan out to appear side-by-side in the sky. Now, an oddly shaped plastic device does the same thing with sound waves. It sends the different wavelengths \u2014 or pitches \u2014 that make up white noise into distinct places around the device. In effect, it creates an acoustic rainbow.",
            "Rasmus Christiansen is part of a team that described the new invention June 13 in Science Advances. A physicist, Christiansen works at the Technical University of Denmark. It\u2019s located in Kongens Lyngby.",
            "Tools such as this could be used for a variety of things, his group says. For instance, it could help control the acoustics of a room by sending certain pitches into a sound absorber.",
            "The new device was inspired by the structure of human ears. The outer ear doesn\u2019t split noise up into pitches. But it does help people determine where different pitches are coming from.",
            "A source at the center of the gadget makes noise from about 8 to 13 kilohertz. Those sound like very high notes. (The highest note on a piano is around 4 kilohertz.) Zeroing in on those frequencies let researchers keep their acoustic rainbow generator small. It\u2019s about the size of a human ear. To handle lower notes, it would have to be bigger. \u00a0",
            "The gizmo works thanks to a smattering of misshapen pillars. Those pillars reflect sound waves in a way that makes them cross paths, or interfere. When waves interfere, they can reinforce or cancel each other out. The result of this complex dance is that sound waves of different pitches get amplified at different places around the device.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/AwlEGQPRfmQ?feature=oembed",
            "An acoustic rainbow spreads the different pitches that make up white noise into different places. You can hear an example in this simulation, in which the device rotates relative to a listener (red dot).",
            "Building a structure that can create an acoustic rainbow is complex. Why? Because juggling sound waves of varying wavelengths is such an intricate process.",
            "To overcome that challenge, Christiansen\u2019s group did something called inverse design.",
            "First, they used a computer model to see what field of sound waves a given design would create. Then, they compared that output with the acoustic rainbow they were going for. They kept tweaking their blueprint until its sound field matched the rainbow.",
            "Once the design was fine-tuned, a 3-D printer produced a prototype. Lab tests showed that it worked as intended.",
            "The pillars inside the device may seem \u201cvery random-looking or weird-looking,\u201d says Christiansen. \u201cBut they really serve their purpose well, because they\u2019ve been tailored for providing exactly what we asked for.\u201d",
