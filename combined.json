            "A DNA deletion on the X chromosome of domestic cats leads to ginger-colored fur, two new studies show. Cats with multicolor coats, like calicos and tortoiseshells, also have the mutation. Both Oscar (orange cat, right) and Alani (calico cat, left) likely have the mutation.",
            "Cats come in many colors and patterns. And bright orange is one of the most striking. The mystery of what gene gives ginger cats their hue has stumped scientists for decades. Now, two different teams have just turned up the same solution.",
            "Most kitties with orange fur share the same cutout in their DNA, the new research shows. Even multicolored cats with a few ginger patches \u2014 such as calicos and tortoiseshells \u2014 have this mutation. The DNA deletion makes cells in cats\u2019 hair-growing structures produce a yellow-red pigment instead of the default brown-black hue.",

            "Researchers knew the bit of DNA, or gene, linked to ginger fur lay in a DNA bundle called the X chromosome. Here\u2019s how.",
            "In cats and most other mammals, males usually have one X and one Y chromosome. Females typically have two X chromosomes. As a result, the single X chromosome is very active in all cells of a male cat. But only one of the two X chromosomes is active in each cell of a female cat.",
            "If the ginger fur gene were on the X chromosome, then male cats with that trait would be completely orange. But in a female cat, both X chromosomes would need to carry the orange trait for her to be fully ginger. If only one X chromosome contained the trait, then her coat would likely become a patchwork of orange and black.",
            "Indeed, that is the color pattern seen among cats. Most completely orange cats are male. Most multicolored cats, meanwhile, are female.",
            "Most other mammal species don\u2019t get ginger hair based on their sex. Not even famously orange big cats (such as tigers) do. So domestic cats possess an unusual mutation, says Chris Kaelin. He studies genetics at Stanford University in California.",

            "fCAlani \u2014 a female calico cat \u2014 likely has the DNA deletion on just one of her X chromosomes. That\u2019s why her coat only has some orange.",
            "Kaelin was part of a team that examined the genes of about 30 cats. They hoped to find DNA features shared only by those with orange fur. Their work revealed a deleted stretch of about 5,000 DNA base pairs near a gene called Arhgap36. (The cat genome has about 2.7 billion base pairs total.) The removed bit was not in the gene itself, but close enough to affect its activity.",
            "Scientists have discovered that a single genetic mutation is behind what makes orange cats orange. It was already known that the gene for orange fur sits on the X chromosome. Since male cats have just one X, they only need a single copy of the gene to be fully orange. Female cats have two X chromosomes, so they\u2019d need the gene on both to be completely orange. Otherwise, they usually end up with a patchwork of orange and black fur. A new study reveals that a DNA deletion causes pigment cells to produce the orange color. #CatsofTikTok #OrangeCat #Science",
            "The Arhgap36 gene carries instructions for making a certain protein. The nearby deletion boosted how much of that protein it makes \u2014 but only in cells that make pigment. (Pigments are chemicals that impart color.)",
            "In pigment-making cells, the protein stops genes needed to make the brown-black pigment from turning on. Instead, a yellow-red pigment is produced. It involves fewer genes, so it\u2019s easier to make, explains Greg Barsh. He\u2019s also a geneticist at Stanford University. (Mammals produce only two pigments. Different shades come from other genetic factors.)",
            "A team in Japan identified the same deletion. This team examined DNA from almost 60 cats. When lots of Arhgap36 protein is made, the genes that make the brown-black pigment become less active, explains Hiroyuki Sasaki. He\u2019s a geneticist at Kyushu University.",
            "His team also found that all orange cats from a global database of 258 kitties had the same deletion. Non-orange ones lacked it. Sasaki suspects the trait was passed down from one ancestral cat. That cat lived more than 900 years ago, suggest Kaelin, Barsh and their team-mates. They base this estimate on historical paintings of calicos.",
            "Before these studies, researchers didn\u2019t know Arhgap36 was involved with a cat\u2019s coloring. It\u2019s mostly active in certain hormone-producing organs, such as the pituitary gland. The gene\u2019s role in ginger hues is unique to domesticated felines."

            "Contagious yawning has been witnessed in several warm-blooded creatures. Besides us, these include chimps, lions and wolves. But here \u201cis the first time this has been demonstrated in [a cold-blooded] species,\u201d says Elisabetta Palagi. She works at the University of Pisa in Italy. As a comparative ethologist, she studies the behaviors of animals, often in the wild. Much of her work has focused on contagious behaviors \u2014 including yawning \u2014 in primates, such as monkeys and apes.",
            "In a new study, she and her team were curious to confirm whether fish yawn \u2014 and if it\u2019s contagious in them, too. People with freshwater aquariums often keep zebrafish (Danio rerio). That\u2019s the species Palagi\u2019s team chose for this work.",

            "The scientists started by observing and filming 18 zebrafish in the lab. The fish usually breathe by quickly opening and closing their mouths. But sometimes they opened their mouths slowly. They also stretched it widely \u2014 then snapped it closed. This seemed to mimic what scientists usually describe in other animals that are yawning (including us).",
            "The researchers turned up many differences between a fish\u2019s normal breathing and a yawn. For instance, the fish opened their mouth wider during a yawn than when simply breathing. And about half the time, a yawning fish also stretched its body. This is \u201cvery interesting,\u201d Palagi says, and something \u201cwe absolutely did not expect to find.\u201d (Yawning people also tend to stretch their bodies about half of the time, she notes.)",

            "Palagi and her team then trained an AI model to recognize those traits they had linked to yawning. Afterward, the researchers gave the AI many screenshots taken from videos of fish. In short order, that AI could distinguish between a yawn and normal breathing, in much the same way her group did.",
            "Next, the researchers showed zebrafish two types of videos. In one, a zebrafish yawned. In the other type, the fish just breathed normally. Palagi\u2019s group showed these videos to many fish and many times to each individual. Then they analyzed how the creatures responded.",
            "The fish were more than twice as likely to yawn when watching a video of another zebrafish yawning than when they were just breathing. This suggests yawning is contagious, the researchers now conclude.",
            "Zebrafish tend to swim in large groups, moving fast and changing direction as one. In the lab, when a fish responded to the video of a yawn, it also tended to change the direction in which it was swimming. In the wild, such a directional change in response to yawning might help zebrafish coordinate their movements, the researchers suspect.\u00a0",

And sometimes it\u2019s a lot of pressure. Like when you\u2019re running or scared. When this happens, what protects your blood vessels against bursting? A new study shows how they cope: Vessel cells morph their structures on a super tiny level.",

They lined this vessel, just 120 micrometers (0.0047 inch) wide, with human cells. As in the human body, this inner layer was thin \u2014 just one cell thick. The formal name for this layer is the vessel\u2019s endothelium (En-doh-THEE-lee-um).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Before the pressure, the actin ran along the length of the vessel. It looked like train tracks, but more spread out. After pressure was applied, the proteins now wrapped around the inside of the vessel.",
            "Next, the team removed the actin from the cells and ran the experiment again. Without actin, the tissue became much softer. Now, it couldn\u2019t handle pressure well. Actin is important for making blood vessels strong, Dessalles concludes. Without it, the cells can\u2019t adapt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

Thousands of light-years beyond them lurks the first lone black hole ever detected. From mid-northern latitudes, Sagittarius appears in the southern sky during summer and early fall.",
            "For the first time, astronomers have confirmed the existence of a lone black hole. This rogue is wandering around the Milky Way \u2014 our galaxy \u2014 with no companion star.",
            "It\u2019s \u201cthe only [loner] so far,\u201d says Kailash Sahu. He\u2019s an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md.",
            "In 2022, Sahu was part of a team that found the dark object moving through the constellation Sagittarius. (This group of stars in the southern sky takes its name from the Latin for \u201carcher.\u201d)",

            "A second team would go on to dispute the claim that this rogue was a black hole. They argued it could be a neutron star.",

Black holes are more than three times as massive as the sun. Neutron stars, though, have less mass than this. So the dark object must be a black hole, Sahu\u2019s group reasoned.",
            "The team shared that finding in the April 20 issue of The Astrophysical Journal.",
            "Solitary black holes should be common. But since they don\u2019t normally affect visible stars, they\u2019re hard to find. The lone black hole in Sagittarius revealed itself only because it passed in front of a dim background star.",
            "During that passage in July 2011, the black hole\u2019s intense gravity magnified the star\u2019s light through what\u2019s known as gravitational lensing. This lensing slowly shifted the star\u2019s apparent position, too.",
            "That star\u2019s position still hasn\u2019t settled down. This shows why \u201cit takes a long time to do the observations,\u201d Sahu says.",

That team estimates the object\u2019s mass may be only six times that of the sun. But because this team is not as certain of the black hole\u2019s mass as Sahu\u2019s group, the two results are considered consistent.",
            "Located 5,000 light-years from Earth, the newfound rogue is much closer than the supermassive black hole at our Milky Way\u2019s center. That central black hole also lies in Sagittarius. It\u2019s also more than five times farther from us.",
            "The star-rich region around the galactic center offers a great hunting ground for other rogue black holes passing in front of stars. Sahu hopes to find additional such loners by using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. It\u2019s due to launch in 2027."

            "A prototype is a test version of an invention or product. It could be a physical item. But it could also be something digital, such as an early version of a website or program.",
            "A person builds a prototype to test how an idea holds up in the real world. That way, they can find flaws in a design and make fixes. Developing an idea from concept to finished product often involves creating multiple prototypes. Each version improves upon the last one.",
            "Prototypes may be simple or complex. Early in the design process, a prototype may be a simple sketch. As someone learns more about what works \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 they build more complex prototypes.",

            "People use different types of prototypes for different purposes. A late-stage prototype that includes all or most of the product\u2019s final parts might called a working prototype. But many prototypes test only certain parts of an idea. Scientists call these proof-of-principle prototypes. For example, a prototype built to test a robot\u2019s wheels might lack a motor and other parts that would be crucial to the final product. But it does allow researchers to test a certain wheel\u2019s grip.",

            "Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth\u2019s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.",
            "Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",
            "Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth\u2019s inner structure. They\u2019ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists \u2014 \u00a0including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago \u2014 have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth\u2019s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

            "Earth\u2019s crust is like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. It is extremely thin, cold\u00a0and brittle compared to what lies below it. The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

That allows the newborns to start off life with a feast.",

The cannibal larvae have bigger mouths and sharper teeth \u2014 the better for scarfing down other larvae with. And that\u2019s not even the most extreme form of peer-on-peer cannibalism. Some shark embryos eat their brothers and sisters while still in their mother\u2019s womb. Only the strongest embryo survives to be born.",

            "One clue is that mosquitoes are able to taste the surfaces on which they land, Baik\u2019s team finds. In fact, sweat may play a big role in whether they bite. Human sweat contains water, salt and amino acids (the building blocks of proteins).",

            "The researchers then looked at activity in certain mosquito nerve cells involved in taste. The more-appealing sweat had a bigger effect on the activity of these nerves than the other sweat samples had. That suggests taste \u201ccould be one of the factors as to why some of us get bitten a lot more than others,\u201d Baik says. \u201cThis was quite exciting.\u201d",

            "Baik wanted to explore how taste might drive mosquitoes\u2019 choice to bite or not.",
            "Tasting requires touch. We use our lips, mouth and tongue to taste. Mosquitoes do, too. A long tube extends from their face like a giant straw. At the end of that proboscis are two small, lip-like parts that can touch a surface. These are called labella.",

Some bitter compounds, though, blocked the nerve cells\u2019 response to sugar. \u201cThis was exciting and surprising,\u201d says Baik. This type of activity blocking, she notes, hasn\u2019t been seen in other insects.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Adding such bitter substances to sugar reduced the nerves\u2019 response to sweet. It also made the mosquitoes less likely to feed. \u201cThis suggested that we could use bitter compounds as a way to stop the feeding behavior of mosquitoes,\u201d says Baik.",
            "\u201cThis team was really the first to systematically show what the taste cells in this mosquito actually respond to,\u201d says Ben Matthews. He works at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Though he did not take part in the new work, Matthews studies insect sensory systems. The new work \u201cshowed not just how these chemicals are processed, but how that affects behavior.\u201d",
            "Baik is now hunting for just the right compound to stop mosquitoes from biting people. The substance should be low-cost, safe and eco-friendly. It could someday be included in a spray for skin and clothing.",

She prefers \u201corganic products over synthetic ones.\u201d That led this sophomore at Garden City High School in New York to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in my sunscreen?\u201d",
            "These products protect our skin against blistering solar rays. But their use comes at a price. Some of sunscreen\u2019s chemicals may cause cancer, Taylor notes. And when these chemicals wash into our environment, they can hurt animals. For example, some mineral sunscreens interfere with the ability of freshwater animals to navigate. High enough exposures, she says, can kill some organisms.",
            "So, Taylor looked for alternatives to mineral-based sunscreens.\u00a0",
            "Bananas can naturally filter out much of the sun\u2019s more damaging rays. Could their natural sunblock replace mineral sunscreens? Taylor investigated. And what she found out won her a spot here in May at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF.",
            "Bananas tend to grow in a \u201cUV-intense environment,\u201d Taylor says. UV \u2014 short for ultraviolet \u2014 is a band of light wavelengths. This high-energy light is invisible to the human eye. But it causes most of the sun\u2019s damage to our skin. For a sunscreen to work, it must protect against certain UV rays.",
            "Taylor had reasoned that bananas \u201cmust have their own mechanism.\u201d After all, they grow near the equator. That\u2019s where UV exposures are strongest.",
            "Plants typically make flavonoids \u2014 pigments that come in a rainbow of colors \u2014 as a defense against the sun\u2019s UV. Taylor wondered if banana flavonoids might work to protect our skin from UV, too.",
            "She wasn\u2019t sure exactly which bananas flavonoids to use. Taylor heated, froze and blended the outer layer of a banana peel. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s exposed to the sunlight,\u201d she explains. Any UV-filtering chemicals likely lie there.",
            "Breaking open the cells released many of their chemicals. From this soup she made two extracts. One of these contained only components that would dissolve in water. That was her aqueous extract. The other contained only chemicals that wouldn\u2019t dissolve in water. That was her nonpolar extract. Nonpolar chemicals dissolve in oil rather than water.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A sunscreen must absorb UV light before it reaches your skin. And the more it absorbs, the better. To test how well each extract could do that, Taylor turned to a light-measuring tool. Called a spectrophotometer, it measures how much of any color of light a liquid absorbs.",
            "The tool confirmed that both of her banana extracts absorbed UV light. But the nonpolar one went a step further. It absorbed the full range of UV wavelengths \u2014 and especially the most damaging ones. They belong to a part of the UV spectrum called UV-A.",
            "Would banana-based sunscreens also be safe for the environment? After all, Taylor says, typical drug-store sunscreens can harm aquatic life. To find out, she recruited planarians (Girardia tigrina) as her \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d Planarians are a type of flatworm that live in water. They\u2019re often used in drug-safety studies, Taylor explains. A chemical that harms these worms might also pose a risk to other aquatic animals.",

She also used a microscope to observe planarians\u2019 locomotion \u2014 or movement \u2014 when exposed to UV light.",
            "The plan was to put planarians into dishes with different extracts and expose them to strong UV light for 10 minutes.

Her five test solutions included her two extracts, a drugstore sunscreen solution, plain water and glycerol.",

            "The three glycerol-exposed groups exhibited the most damage. The aqueous extract group showed the least. Where damage did show up, Taylor says, it looked \u201cspotty.\u201d That probably means a worm \u201cwas not fully coated.\u201d",
            "The next step is figuring out exactly what chemical provided the aqueous extract\u2019s UV protection. Identifying that, she says, could allow for a new class of eco-friendly, banana-based sunscreens.",

            "When rain or snow falls, much of it seeps into the soil. From there it flows down through porous rock, gravel and sand, forming underground streams. This groundwater will sometimes travel long distances. Scientists have now attempted to calculate its path in North America. Their findings suggest water can travel below ground much farther and deeper \u2014 and for a much longer time \u2014 than had been expected.",
            "For instance, some groundwater can travel up to 238 kilometers (148 miles), the new study reports. And it can seep to depths of more than 90 meters (300 feet).",
            "Or consider the deep groundwater pumped up for drinking. Most was believed to be separate from polluted water that often resurfaces in streams and rivers. But through long, buried treks, groundwater can link areas thought to be separate \u2014 sharing pollution it picked up along the way.\u00a0",
            "All that water now appears \u201ca lot more connected,\u201d says Reed Maxwell, an author of the new study. He works at Princeton University in New Jersey. As a hydrologist, he studies the movement of water.",
            "His team shared its findings on how water moves in the January 6 issue of Nature Water.",
            "Understanding these connections between water sources, they say, is important. It could help water managers work together to make better decisions about how to use water for drinking, irrigating crops and supporting ecosystems.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A watershed (also known as a catchment) is the broad expanse of land that funnels snowmelt and rain downhill to a body of open water (such as a lake or ocean). Some rain and snowmelt will remain above ground. But much will seep underground as it moves.",
            "Water managers decide who gets to use the water within a watershed and how. Watersheds are managed separately. But water can flow freely underground across watershed boundaries, says Laura Condon. She\u2019s a hydrologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\u00a0",
            "If watersheds are connected, then problems in one might affect another, says Maxwell. This got him thinking: \u201cIf you dump pollution in one watershed, does it get to another?\u201d\u00a0",
            "Others had mapped groundwater flows in various parts of the United States. But how distant sources of underground water might be connected hadn\u2019t been clear. That was one motivation for this study, says Maxwell. Understanding how water moves across a continent underground can help show how, when and where impacts to that water may occur.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Maxwell and Condon\u2019s team decided to track groundwater\u2019s flow beneath most of continental North America. They started with where this water reemerges in streams. Then, working backward, they figured out where it must have first seeped into the Earth.",
            "To do this, they built a computer model. It simulated North America\u2019s underground layers of rock to depths of 392 meters (1,200 feet). Next, they divided the continent into little blocks. Each was one kilometer long by one kilometer wide.",
            "Then they asked the model to calculate how much water would likely flow through each block. That would depend on the shape and thickness of Earth\u2019s underground layers and the space between the rocks.",
            "Each block is like a Lego brick, Maxwell says. Once they calculated water\u2019s flow in each one, they stacked them together \u2014 85 million of them.",
            "Then they added simulated water droplets to the computer model. The model \u201cpushes\u201d these droplets around based on how water would flow through the layers of below ground rock. And the scientists tracked everywhere they would go.",
            "\u201cThink of a video game: Where would the little ball go? It\u2019ll be pushed by the velocity this way,\u201d says Condon. \u00a0Then, \u201cwhere would it go next?\u201d",
            "Water often travels more than 97 kilometers (60 miles), the model showed. That wouldn\u2019t be far if water was streaming across the surface, says Maxwell. But it was far longer than it had been expected to flow below ground.",
            "Most water stays below the surface for five to 10 years, the model found. But buried aquifers (underground layers of water-filled rock) also exist. Water can collect in them for 100,000 to 1 million years.",

            "Consider, for instance, the nitrate fertilizers that farmers apply to soils. In large amounts, nitrates can harm people and aquatic life. Rain can wash these chemicals into groundwater. From there, they can potentially travel far from the farms on which they had been used. That can pollute water once thought to be free of such chemicals.",
            "Models might also point to where water being pumped from the ground at one site (for drinking or irrigation) had been on its way to hydrate a distant wetland. Knowing this, says Claudia Faunt, managers might then make sure they leave enough water in the ground to sustain that wetland \u2014 and the ecosystem it supports. Faunt didn\u2019t take part in the new study. But as a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in San Diego, Calif., she understands these issues.\u00a0",

She hadn\u2019t thought much about fluoridation \u2014 until 2011. That\u2019s when the Calgary City Council decided to stop adding fluoride to the city\u2019s water.",
            "The move gave McLaren an idea for a study. She\u2019d look at how the dental health of local children fared once fluoride was gone.",
            "She recruited dental hygienists to inspect the mouths of second-graders. Some went to schools in Calgary. Others went to schools in Edmonton. It\u2019s a city in the same province that\u2019s roughly the same size. And it still added fluoride to its water.",
            "In Calgary, the team surveyed second-graders about seven years after water fluoridation had ended. So these kids likely had never been exposed to fluoride in their drinking water. Of 2,649 children, 65 percent had tooth decay. That\u2019s nearly two in every three. In Edmonton, 55 percent of the 2,600 surveyed children had tooth decay.",
            "On a population level, that difference is \u201cquite large,\u201d McLaren says.",
            "\u201cCompared to Edmonton kids, Calgary kids were now considerably worse as far as dental health goes,\u201d McLaren says. Her team looked at other factors, such as diet, social measures and family income. But none of these, she says, could explain the differences between dental health in the two cities\u2019 kids.",
            "And the number of kids with decay wasn\u2019t the only difference. More kids treated for tooth decay-related problems had to be placed under general anesthesia in Calgary than in Edmonton. That finding comes from an April 2024 study in the Canadian Journal of Public Health. It suggests the decay in these kids may have been more severe or extensive. From 2018 to 2019, 32 out of every 10,000 children in Calgary were put under general anesthesia to treat tooth decay. In Edmonton, it was roughly half as many.",
            "The findings don\u2019t surprise local dentists, says Bruce Yaholnitsky. He specializes in gum disease and other mouth issues in Calgary. \u201cThis is just obvious to us. But you need to have proper science to prove, in some cases, the obvious.\u201d",

            "Juneau, Alaska\u2019s capital, showed similar signs of fluoride\u2019s value.",
            "Jennifer Meyer moved to the city in 2015. At the time, she had two young children. Her third was born in Juneau. She was surprised at how\u00a0many fillings and other dental work other young kids seemed to have.",
            "\u201cI thought \u2018Wow, what\u2019s going on here?\u2019 Because I could see a lot of the decay and the repairs,\u201d Meyer says.",
            "Meyer is a public health researcher at the University of Alaska Anchorage. She wondered whether a lack of fluoride might be playing some role.",
            "Before Juneau voted to stop adding fluoride to its water, a six-member commission had reviewed evidence on the value of fluoride. Meyer got a copy of the commission\u2019s report. In it, two commission members opposed to fluoridation made some claims about its risks. Meyer says those claims were \u201cfalse\u201d and not based on \u201cquality\u201d research.",
            "The commission\u2019s chair criticized anti-fluoride positions. At one point, he wrote that part of the cited research was \u201cjunk science.\u201d But in the end, he still recommended that the city stop adding fluoride to its water. He claimed the evidence about the safety of low levels of fluoride was not conclusive. That left the commission\u2019s members split at 3\u20133.",
            "Afterward, the Juneau Assembly voted to end fluoridation. The practice ended in 2007.",
            "Meyer\u2019s team pored over records from a government program called Medicaid. It helps cover the costs of health-care treatments for people with limited income.",
            "The team compared dental claims made before and after the city stopped using fluoride. They found a big effect on children under age 6. In 2003, when fluoride was still present, these kids had an average of 1.5 procedures to treat tooth decay. In 2012, five years after fluoride use stopped, this number had risen to 2.5 treatments per child.",
            "These extra treatments come at a steep price. The cost, when adjusted for inflation, jumped by an average of $303 per child from 2003 to 2012.",
            "Who ends up paying those higher costs? Taxpayers, Meyer says.",
            "\u201cWhen politicians decide to withhold a safe and effective public health intervention like fluoridation, they are imposing a hidden health care tax on everyone in their state or community,\u201d Meyer says.",

            "fCMore than 60 percent of Americans had access to public tap water with fluoride in 2022. Many places are now questioning whether to continue adding fluoride to water.",
            "Today, many who oppose fluoride in water point to a review published last August. It was released by the National Toxicology Program. This U.S. program evaluates the health effects of substances.",
            "That 2024 review has proven controversial. It concluded with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water was correlated \u2014 or linked \u2014 with lower IQs in children.",
            "One reason why that statement was controversial: That dose is more than double what the CDC recommends adding to water.",
            "And authors of this review couldn\u2019t tell if lower levels \u2014 like those found in treated U.S. drinking water \u2014 affect kids\u2019 IQ. Plus, that correlation is not causation. Seeing a lowered IQ does not prove that higher levels of fluoride caused it. Indeed, that warning is noted on the program\u2019s website.",
            "Meyer cautions against making decisions \u201cbased on weak or misrepresented evidence.\u201d Choosing to stop adding fluoride, she says, \u201cis not a precaution, it\u2019s negligence.\u201d",
            "Juneau still doesn\u2019t add fluoride to its water. But in 2021, 62 percent of Calgary residents voted to bring it back. That\u2019s more than voted in 1989 to first put fluoride in Calgary\u2019s water. Legal scholar Guichon says McLaren\u2019s study helped get people to vote for it.",
            "\u201cMore people voted to reinstate fluoride than voted for the mayor. So that\u2019s a success,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cBut in America, we are entering a dark time.\u201d"

            "Before vaccines, many kids suffered from debilitating or deadly infections. Such horrible illnesses included measles, polio and smallpox. Now, vaccines have wiped out \u2014 or nearly wiped out \u2014 those diseases from many parts of the world.",
            "In fact, scientists reported last year that vaccines have saved some 154 million lives in the last 50 years. About 146 million of those saved were children under age five.",
            "Vaccines help protect people from disease by training the body\u2019s immune system to fight off harmful pathogens.",
            "Some vaccines, such as flu shots, contain killed versions of disease-causing microbes. Others, including vaccines against measles and smallpox, contain weakened forms of germs. Still others, including COVID-19 vaccines, contain instructions for the body to briefly make proteins typically made by a pathogen. Each of those options offers the body a small \u2014 but safe \u2014 sample of what a dangerous germ might look like.",
            "When the body detects those intruders, the immune system launches a response. It sends its own proteins, called antibodies, to fend off the invaders. This is basically a dress rehearsal for how to fight off the disease. That way, if someone is ever exposed to a real, live form of the germ, their body already knows how to defend itself.",
            "But vaccines don\u2019t just protect those who have gotten vaccinated. The more people who get vaccinated, the fewer people can spread the disease. That helps shield those who can\u2019t get vaccinated, such as babies and cancer patients, from infection.",
            "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, recommend vaccines for more than a dozen deadly illnesses. Measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and the flu are just a few examples. You can get some vaccines through nasal sprays. Others have to be given through shots. (Engineers are working on ways to deliver vaccines through puffs of air or skin patches as alternatives to shots.)",
