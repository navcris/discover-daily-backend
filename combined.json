            "Paula Kirya at the University of California, San Diego holds a morpho butterfly wing. She used what she learned about how it gets its blue hue to pioneer a new way to study cancer and other diseases.",
            "The morpho butterfly is a flying marvel. It flits through the rainforests of Central and South America. With wings that can span 20 centimeters (8 inches), it can be bigger than most human hands. Those wings shimmer with a dazzling blue hue. New data show these butterfly wings could one day become the basis of a new medical tool \u2014 one that might help doctors investigate the development and severity of some cancers.",
            "Although this butterfly\u2019s wings are blue, that hue is not due to any pigment. Instead, it comes from how light reflects and refracts off tiny microstructures atop those wings. The shimmering color of the wing depends on how light hits it. (Many materials, from rocks to plastic wrap, have this property, called structural color.)",
            "Researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) have now shown how those microstructures can provide a new view on biological tissue.",
            "The method they devised was simple. They placed a morpho wing on one microscope slide. Then they placed a thin slice of tissue on a second slide. After lining up the two, they turned on a special kind of light. This polarized light went through both the wing and the tissue beneath it. The light reflected back and passed through both again.",
            "*a_microscopic_view_of_bright_blue_butterfly_scales_",
            "fCThe wing of a morpho butterfly, seen here at 100x magnification, has tiny microstructures that give it a vivid blue hue. ",
            "This process can reveal alterations in the structural fibers that make up certain tissues. These are called fibrotic changes. And they can help researchers diagnose or study many diseases.",
            "The UCSD team described its new technique in the January 15 Advanced Materials. It can spot changes in fibrous tissue that may signal breast cancer \u2014 and whether that cancer is getting ready to spread.",
            "It\u2019s often hard to study fibrous tissues in a medical clinic, says Lisa Poulikakos. She\u2019s a materials scientist at UCSD. \u201cUsually,\u201d she explains, \u201cyou need those expensive optical machines that cost around $200,000.\u201d They\u2019re not available to many doctors. Plus, she adds, looking for microstructural changes in tissue often requires first staining or dyeing it. But those processes change the tissue itself. The dyes also break down with time.",
            "This new technique is a simpler and less expensive way to diagnose the fibrous nature of cancer tissue, she says. It requires only a microscope and one morpho wing. And the only thing that hits the tissue, she notes, is light.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The method came about because two scientists happened to be in the right place at the right time. Poulikakos was one of them. The other was Paula Kirya. This graduate student had just come to study at UCSD.",
            "\u201cDr. Poulikakos was maybe the first person I met in San Diego,\u201d says Kirya. \u201cShe let me join her lab very quickly.\u201d In that lab, scientists study how light interacts with materials.",
            "This team knew that fibrous tissue reflects light in unusual ways. They also knew that etching marks into a material could make it reflect different colors of light in different directions. They wanted to combine these two ideas to create a tool that would more accurately reveal how fibrous some tissue might have become.",
            "When Kirya visited the lab, a student told her they were having trouble reflecting blue light. At once, something clicked in Kirya\u2019s mind. She went to Poulikakos and said: \u201cIf this is what we\u2019re trying to do, we could just look at the morpho butterfly and see these features.\u201d",
            "For two years before she came to UCSD, Kirya had been studying the blue morpho butterfly. She knew its wings\u2019 deep hue doesn\u2019t come from any natural dye or other chemical. Instead, it shimmers blue thanks to how tiny structures on its surface manipulate light.",
            "fC",
            "Poulikakos was delighted at Kirya\u2019s idea \u2014 and the new project was born.",
            "Kirya bought a single morpho wing for about $8 in a local store. \u201cThey gave us a discount,\u201d she says. \u201cMost insect collectors want pristine insects. We just wanted the wing.\u201d Then she began experimenting with ways to combine samples of tumor tissue and this wing.",
            "By rotating the tissue and wing together under a microscope, the scientists quickly found they could see the thick fibers associated with cancer.",
            "Their method didn\u2019t require any costly materials. Best of all? It needed no stain or dye. In fact, this is one major advantage of the new method, says Vance Williams. A materials scientist, Williams works at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada.",
            "\u201cThe material itself doesn\u2019t absorb light. And it\u2019s not using dye that tends to fade over time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just all weird optical effects.\u201d",
            "Plus, Kirya notes, a single wing can be used again and again for years.",
            "But this discovery was just the first step.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/sT7p4HAApJM?feature=oembed",
            "A material called collagen can help some cancerous tumors grow. High levels of collagen can be a sign of how likely a cancer is to spread. One way to measure collagen levels, new data show, is to see how polarized light reflects off fiber-like microstructures in the tissue.\u00a0 \u00a0",
            "Polarized light is made up of light waves that all vibrate in the same plane. When the direction of this light lines up with tiny structures on the morpho\u2019s wing, the light reflects brightly. The same thing happens for fibrous tissue, though less strongly.",
            "The UCSD team found that shining polarized light through both materials now strengthened the light signal from those fibers.",
            "\u201cThey\u2019re using some clever optics,\u201d Williams says, to make it \u201camplify a small signal.\u201d",
            "The light show put on by morpho butterfly wings shows up in other materials, too, he notes. (You can see much the same thing by looking through two polarizing lenses at stretched-out plastic wrap.) Williams designs materials with similar properties. They change color depending on how light strikes them.",
            "Kirya may be young, says Poulikakos, but \u201cshe\u2019s really a true scientist.\u201d She took detailed measurements of the fibrous tissues and the reflected light. Then she worked with other researchers to develop a computer model to turn those measurements into meaningful information about how advanced a breast cancer was. That\u2019s a gauge of how likely it is to spread and become lethal.",
            "Kirya suspects that her new technique could be most useful in parts of the world where scientists don\u2019t have access to expensive machines for diagnosing tissues. \u201cI had been looking at butterflies for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a dream of mine to apply that knowledge to real life. To a real-life problem.\u201d Now she has.",

That movement is caused by plant organs growing at different times and at different rates throughout the day.",

After an internship at a tech company making semiconductors, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. The Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago caught my eye. It\u2019s something that I really feel can change the world. I decided to go to a lab [run by Bozhi Tian] that worked with biointerface materials. These help seamlessly connect technology with the body.

That\u2019s a big deal because an atom\u2019s nucleus determines which element it is. By making new nuclei, nucleosynthesis makes different elements, too.",
            "Nucleosynthesis works in one of two ways. It can start with protons and neutrons (or something even smaller) and bind them into a nucleus. Or it can start with a few lighter nuclei and fuse them into a heavier one.",
            "An atom\u2019s nucleus contains protons and neutrons. An atom\u2019s atomic number \u2014 the number of protons it contains \u2014 determines the element\u2019s identity. For example, all helium atoms have two protons. Helium\u2019s atomic number is 2. If an atom has two protons, it\u2019s a helium atom. If, by some process, a helium atom gains two more protons, it will no longer be helium. It would now be beryllium.",
            "This process doesn\u2019t always change the element. If only the number of neutrons in a nucleus changes, the element stays the same. That\u2019s because the number of protons, not neutrons, determines the element type.",
            "Most nucleosynthesis occurs in the cosmos. It started with the Big Bang, which exploded our universe into being. As matter and space rapidly expanded from the Big Bang, particles started to group together. Some of those particles were protons and neutrons. And in joining them together, the Big Bang created atomic nuclei. Scientists believe that lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, came from nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang.",
            "Other elements have been forged inside stars. During its lifetime, a star fuses lighter nuclei \u2014 such as hydrogen and helium \u2014 into heavier ones. The extreme gravity in the star\u2019s core drives this process. This is called stellar nucleosynthesis. This is where much of the carbon, iron and other elements crucial for life originate.",
            "Even in death, stars can form new elements. When supermassive stars die, they don\u2019t just fade away. They explode as a supernova. This releases huge amounts of energy. Enough energy to fuse nuclei together and create new elements. Scientists believe supernova nucleosynthesis made much of the oxygen in our universe. Supernovas likely cooked up most of the elements heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium, too.",

            "Solar farms use solar panels to generate clean energy. But these farms take up a lot of land. Farms that grow crops and raise livestock use a lot of land too. Agrivoltaics saves space by allowing farmers to harvest electricity and food from the same land.",
            "Research has shown that adding solar panels to farms can actually help crops. Leafy crops, such as lettuces and some herbs, grow well in the shade of the solar panels. The plants can also benefit from the increased soil moisture in partially shaded ground.",

            "Mosquitoes spread the malaria parasite. One way to fight malaria is by releasing lab-grown mosquitoes infected with a special bacteria. It renders the insects infertile. When released into nature, these mosquitoes mate with wild ones and lay eggs that cannot hatch. That will shrink the mosquito population over time.",
            "One problem: Many of the lab-grown mosquitoes don\u2019t survive well enough in the wild to complete their mission.",
            "Logan suspected that might be because the insects lacked key microbes that wild mosquitoes pick up from their environment. So he exposed the lab-grown insects to microbes from the water where wild mosquitoes mature. This treatment sped the lab-grown mosquitoes\u2019 growth by 18 percent. And it boosted their fitness by 67 percent. That may help scientists raise more mosquitoes faster and give the skeeters better odds of surviving in the wild.",

Honeycreepers like the i\u2019iwi dip their long beaks into flowers for nectar. Owls use their long upper beaks to fish insects out of bark. \u201cI\u2019m looking a little bit at the genetic basis of adaptive radiation,\u201d Logan explains. \u201cSo these genes in the birds, where might there be changes that affected how the birds developed?\u201d",

Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

A person with synesthesia may see colors or patterns when they hear music. Or, as the late physicist Richard Feynman claimed, to see numbers as colors.

They may also have strong reactions to sensory inputs, such as sounds or textures. Those with ADHD may have trouble focusing or sitting still.",

Yet over time, society has labeled only one brain type as normal, Shekhar says. \u201cAnybody\u2019s brain that worked differently started to be called impaired or deficient,\u201d she says.

Studies also have shown that autistic brains respond differently to stimuli than do non-autistic ones.",

            "Study after study confirms that vaccines are safe and save lives. So, most parents say yes to vaccines. They want to protect their children from diseases that can cause permanent harm or even death. Yet some parents say no. Many of these people base that refusal on a 1998 study that claimed to find a link between autism and vaccines.",
            "Autism is a disorder that affects how the brain develops. Its symptoms can range from mild to severe. These symptoms can start to appear around the same time that kids get many of their vaccinations.\u00a0So the 1998 study worried parents. Many feared their kids might develop autism after getting the MMR vaccine. That vaccine gets its name from the fact that it protects against three major childhood diseases: measles, mumps and rubella.",
            "In fact, the 1998 study\u2019s claims were false. Scientists debunked the report long ago. Still, some people haven\u2019t learned about that or refuse to believe data that find no signs of an autism link. None. The most recent of these follow-up studies \u2014 and the largest \u2014 came out March 5, 2019 in the\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine. Like the others, it found no link between autism and vaccines.",
            "In this new study, Anders Hviid of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark and his colleagues collected data on more than 657,000 Danish children between 1999 and 2013. They followed the children from age 1. Denmark provides free vaccines for children. As a result, most families chose to have their kids receive the MMR vaccine. But not all.",
            "Over the study period, 6,517 children were diagnosed with autism. But the team found that children who got the MMR vaccine were no more likely to be diagnosed with autism than were those who didn\u2019t get it. Groups that might be more susceptible to autism also did not have an increased risk from being vaccinated.",
            "The initial claim of a possible autism link appeared in The Lancet. A small study, it had focused on just 11 boys and one girl with autism. Led by a surgeon in England, Andrew Wakefield, this study linked autism in these kids to their having gotten the MMR vaccine.",
            "That 1998 study had not been performed well. Later research would show this. That didn\u2019t stop parents around the world from panicking over its claims, however.",
            "Many scientists also were concerned about the claims by Wakefield\u2019s group. Some of them tried to repeat the study. But they didn\u2019t get the same result. Much larger studies investigated further. They, too, failed to find support for the claim made by Wakefield\u2019s team. More than that, research turned up evidence that Wakefield committed fraud. A series of articles published in BMJ, a British medical journal, outlined much of the evidence for that in 2011.",
            "Despite all of this, the 1998 study\u2019s claims have mushroomed online. One 2016 study in the\u00a0Journal of Communication in Healthcare found nearly 500 anti-vaccine websites. The study\u2019s authors looked at tactics used by different websites. Fear of autism is a big theme, thanks to the now-discredited study, it found. Some websites even cast Wakefield as a victim. Those websites dismissed or excused the big problems with his report.",
            "Other websites included vague appeals to readers\u2019 values or emotions. Some sites argued for individual freedom of choice. Those arguments don\u2019t mention that public health and safety laws protect everyone. Other websites fostered distrust of doctors and companies that make vaccines. They did not point out that parents will need both doctors and vaccines if children get sick. Still other sites suggested that vaccines were somehow toxic or not \u201cnatural.\u201d They ignored the fact that preventable diseases are \u201cnatural\u201d \u2014 yet can still be deadly.",

            "Sometimes when scientists can\u2019t replicate, or reproduce, another study\u2019s findings, it\u2019s because someone made a mistake. But Wakefield\u2019s group didn\u2019t just make mistakes, scientists would find. And the 1998 study wasn\u2019t just false. It was \u201cfraudulent,\u201d editors of\u00a0BMJ would later report.",
            "In January 2010, a government panel in the United Kingdom announced that it had found many problems with the 1998 study. Wakefield, for example, had gotten money from lawyers involved in lawsuits against the companies that make vaccines. That\u2019s considered a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d Wakefield also was charged with picking and choosing data to show what he wanted. That reflected poor study design. Evidence also showed that the team had fudged data \u2014 changed them to make them say what Wakefield wanted. Beyond that, there were ethical problems with how Wakefield\u2019s team had gotten data on the children.",
            "Wakefield lost his medical license. And\u00a0The Lancet\u00a0retracted his group\u2019s paper in February 2010. Scientific journals have since become more attentive to signs of potential fraud.",
            "Yet the damage from Wakefield\u2019s work continues. Many parents still refuse to vaccinate their children because of his team\u2019s initial claims.",
            "\u201cI see your pain [and] your desire for answers to your children\u2019s health problems,\u201d said Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman. He made this comment as an aside to parents of children with autism during a March 5 congressional hearing in Washington, D.C. But the answer is not to refuse vaccines, Wiesman stressed.",
            "In the end, says Hotez, there is no link between vaccines and autism. That complex brain condition starts during pregnancy \u2014 long before anyone gets vaccines, he notes.",
            "Hotez wrote about many more studies confirming the lack of any vaccine link to autism in a 2018 book. It\u2019s about own adult daughter, Rachel, who has autism. And the title sums up what all the studies show:\u00a0Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel\u2019s Autism."

She switched to a New Hampshire boarding school for children who were smart but struggled in regular schools. One of Grandin\u2019s favorite activities there was riding horses. When a horse grew frightened or upset, she often found ways to calm it.",

The design holds cattle still while they receive shots or other treatment. After seeing how the pen calmed down cattle, Grandin asked her aunt to close her inside it. She felt safe and calm inside, as though someone was protecting her.",
            "Back at school, Grandin built her own squeeze machine. Her science teacher encouraged her to study whether it could calm other students too. She found many students liked it. Observing their responses and collecting data made Grandin want to become a scientist.",
            "Grandin kept analyzing her squeeze machine in college while earning a degree in psychology. She also studied animal behavior and genetics. Throughout, she remained interested in how animals thought. \u201cI saw a movie in high school that used a distorted room to create optical illusions,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was fascinated. It made me think about how animals perceived things, because animals see in pictures too.\u201d",

She redesigned dip vats \u2014 big pools for bathing farm animals in anti-insect solutions \u2014 so that cattle would walk into them without panicking. And she developed new designs for slaughterhouses. Rather than force cattle on a straight path, her designs led the animals along curving runways. Cattle follow these curved pathways, calmly and orderly, until they could be killed humanely.",

She calls it \u201cbiological system overload.\u201d In her view, many farmers and ranchers are too focused on breeding animals that will produce lots of meat, milk or eggs. They selectively breed animals with these traits. But they don\u2019t think about other traits, such as strength or resistance to disease. As a result, Grandin sees many animals that lead shorter and less healthy lives.",

Even when just a few birds get sick, farmers have to slaughter the whole flock. That serves to limit the spread of the virus. The 2015 outbreak proved costly. Farmers ended up killing almost 50 million chickens and turkeys.",

That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",

As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux.

            "In recent years, scientists have uncovered lots of new details about itching. And they\u2019ve developed new ways to fight harmful forms of it, Kaplan says. The new study may point out other new approaches to treating itch.",
            "So is scratching good or bad? \u201cIt\u2019s both!\u201d Kaplan says."

            "Julianna Hayes is a 10-year-old who lives in New Hampshire. She has a black belt in karate, loves the ice cream flavor \u201ctornado\u201d and wants to be a teacher. She also has asthma.\u00a0",

            "This chronic lung condition can make it hard to breathe. People with asthma may feel fine most of the time. But if they encounter a trigger \u2014 such as smoke or animal fur \u2014an attack may come on. During such an attack, people often cough, wheeze and feel tired.",
            "Most of the time, Julianna says, \u201cI feel like I imagine any other person without asthma would feel.\u201d But sometimes during an asthma attack \u201cmy chest will get tight and I can\u2019t breathe in all the way.\u201d",
            "Luckily, Julianna has not had such an attack in a while. \u201cI feel relieved that I\u2019ve been diagnosed and that I have the right medication,\u201d she says.\u00a0",
            "More than 26 million people in the United States \u2014 roughly one in every 13 \u2014 have asthma. Some may treat their condition with inhalers. Others may need newer medications, such as monthly shots. The good news: Having asthma does not need to stop you from doing what you want. With proper treatments, people with asthma can live normal lives.",
            "Asthma affects how air moves through the lungs.",
            "When you inhale, air flows from your mouth or nose through your windpipe and into your lungs. The windpipe is a bit like the trunk of a tree that splits into two branches, one leading to each lung. Within the lungs, these big branches split off into smaller and smaller branches.",
            "At the ends of the tiniest branches, where a tree\u2019s leaves would be, your lungs have small air sacs.\u00a0The walls of these balloon-like sacs are only one cell wide! Here, your blood sucks up oxygen from the air.\u00a0",
            "Robyn Cohen is a doctor at Boston Medical Center in Massachusetts. She treats children with lung diseases. In someone with asthma, \u201cthe breathing tubes basically get swollen so that the tunnel inside the tube is narrowed,\u201d she explains. That makes it harder to pull air into the lungs.",

            "Learn what happens during asthma attacks and some ways the condition can be treated.",
            "To make matters worse, some things can trigger small muscles around the outside of the airways to tighten. This squeezes the branches, narrowing the air space inside them even more.",
            "This sudden constriction causes an asthma attack. Triggers can include pollutants and other things in the environment, such as pet dander (flaked off bits of skin). Viruses that cause colds also can trigger attacks. Sometimes, even exercise can bring on an attack.",
            "Different people may have different triggers. Often, avoiding triggers is the best way to avoid an asthma attack. But it can be hard to avoid triggers like tree pollen or polluting gases (such as ozone) in the air.",

            "fCThe lungs of people with asthma have narrowed airways. It\u2019s due to swelling, excess mucus and muscle constriction. During an asthma attack, airways narrow even more.",
            "The airway swelling in many people with asthma comes from an overactive immune system.",
            "Our immune system is like a large army of blood cells that protect the body. Some of those cells are general soldiers. Others work as snipers with specific targets. Still others act more like lookouts. They warn the rest of the army of incoming threats.",
            "Eosinophils (Ee-oh-SIN-uh-fils) are one type of lookout cell. In the lungs, eosinophils can send messages to recruit other immune cells to fight threats. But in some people with asthma, they work too aggressively. If overactive, they can recruit too many soldiers to the lungs. This can cause the airways to narrow.\u00a0",
            "*a_microscopic_image_of_blood_cells,_splotchy_red_blobs_and_an_eosinophil,",
            "fCThis microscopic view of a blood sample shows mostly red blood cells and platelets. The larger, magenta cell, however, is an eosinophil. This immune cell can send out signals that recruit other types of immune cells to join it.",
            "Fortunately, narrow airways can be treated with asthma inhalers. These devices disperse medicine into the throat \u2014 usually as a very fine powder. As you inhale, this fine powder gets drawn into the smallest branches of the lungs. There, it can widen airways by relaxing muscles surrounding the lungs\u2019 branching tunnels.",
            "Inhalers can come in all different shapes and strengths of medication. \u201cNot everybody needs medication every day,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cSome people only need it sometimes.\u201d",
            "However, traditional inhalers may not be enough for people with severe asthma.",
            "To help these people, scientists have developed injectable medications over the past two decades. These shots are being prescribed to a small, but growing, number of people. Called biologics, these treatments work in a different way than the drugs in asthma inhalers. Instead of relaxing muscles, they act directly on the immune cells that trigger swelling. \u00a0",
            "Biologics get their name from the fact that they are not simple lab-made chemicals. Instead, they are large molecules, such as proteins, produced by living organisms. Some can even be whole genes.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Some biologics for asthma treat overactive eosinophils. They keep those cells from signaling other immune cells. Another biologic prevents target cells from receiving the eosinophils\u2019 signals. In each case, these therapies reduce how many immune cells move into the lungs. And fewer immune cells mean less swelling and easier breathing.",
            "Biologics can help prevent frequent asthma attacks, notes Khalilah Gates. She\u2019s a lung doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, Ill.\u00a0People receiving biologics won\u2019t need to use an inhaler as much (though they may still need one from time to time).",
            "Biologics won\u2019t help everyone with severe asthma. \u201cMost of the biologics require a certain amount of eosinophils in the blood,\u201d says Gates. So, doctors may do a blood test to check for levels of these before prescribing biologics. But, she says, \u201cbiologics have really been helpful in a subset of people.\u201d",
            "Biologics helped one of Cohen\u2019s young patients with severe asthma. For years, this patient \u201ccould not go to the park, could not go to the playground and run around at all,\u201d she says. He ended up in the hospital multiple times a year.",
            "Once he started using a biologic, he didn\u2019t have to go to the hospital. He even stopped missing school days because of his asthma, Cohen says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "One downside is that biologics have to be given as a shot. They can\u2019t be given as a pill or inhaler. Most people get the shots once a month, though some must be given more frequently.",
            "In 2025, it is \u201cso exciting to be able to give really good asthma treatment for people, even if their asthma is severe,\u201d Cohen says.",
            "Julianna says her asthma doesn\u2019t keep her from doing most things. The reason: She has the right medications and knows how to use them. \u201cI feel like as long as you are diagnosed and you have what you need, it doesn\u2019t stop you,\u201d she says.",
