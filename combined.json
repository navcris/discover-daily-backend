            "Feeding a baby born by caesarean section milk containing a tiny bit of their mother\u2019s poo introduces beneficial microbes to their gut, according to a clinical trial. The approach might one day help to prevent diseases during childhood and later in life.",
            "The study \u2014 which reported early results last week during IDWeek, a meeting of infectious-disease specialists and epidemiologists in Los Angeles, California \u2014 is the first randomized controlled trial to test the \u2018poo milkshake\u2019 concept.",
            "The preliminary findings confirm researchers\u2019 hypothesis that a small faecal-matter transplant is enough to have a positive effect on the infant\u2019s microbiome, says Otto Helve, director of the public-health department at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki, Finland, and the study\u2019s primary investigator.",
            "h2Inherited microbes",
            "Some studies show that babies born by c-section, rather than vaginal birth, have a higher risk of asthma, inflammation of the digestive system and other diseases associated with a dysfunctional immune system1. Scientists think that these differences arise because babies born by c-section aren\u2019t exposed to and rapidly colonized by the microbes in their mothers\u2019 vaginas and guts. Studies have even shown that c-section babies are more vulnerable to pathogens in hospitals than are babies born by vaginal birth2.",
            "Do C-section babies need mum\u2019s microbes? Trials tackle controversial idea",
            "Experiments have attempted to compensate for that by swabbing babies born by c-section with microbes from their mother\u2019s vagina or giving them these microbes orally, a practice known as \u2018vaginal seeding\u2019. But this technique has had limited success, because vaginal microbes, scientists have learnt, cannot effectively colonize infants\u2019 guts, says Yan Shao, a microbiome scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK.",
            "Helve and his colleagues have been pioneers in testing whether faecal transplants can instead improve the health of a baby\u2019s microbiome. In their latest trial, which recruited women scheduled for a c-section at the Helsinki University Hospital, the researchers mixed a fluid containing 3.5 milligrams of a mother\u2019s poo into milk and gave the concoction to the corresponding baby. They did this for 15 babies during their first feed. Another 16 babies received a placebo.",
            "An analysis of the babies\u2019 poo samples showed that the two groups had similar microbial diversity at birth, but from their second day of life, there is a marked difference between the two groups, which persisted until 6 months of age, around when babies start eating solid food.",
            "C-section babies are missing key microbes",
            "The trial, which will monitor the babies during their first two years, is ongoing, but the early data align with what was seen in a small pilot study3 without a placebo group published by the same team in 2020. The researchers studied seven babies and found that the microbiomes of those that received a maternal faecal transplant developed similarly to those of babies born by vaginal delivery.",
            "Given the success of the pilot study, \u201cit isn\u2019t surprising that maternal faecal microbiota transplantation would make a difference to the c-section infant microbiota\u201d in the latest trial, Shao says. He notes that, although the trial is an important clinical study, it doesn\u2019t directly compare the microbiome of treated c-section babies with that of infants delivered vaginally \u2014 which would be needed to demonstrate that the technique effectively restores microbiomes affected by c-section.",
            "h2\u2018Don\u2019t try this at home\u2019",
            "The researchers emphasize that no one should try this approach at home. Trial participants went through extensive screening. \u201cYou have to be certain that the faecal matter that you give to the newborn doesn\u2019t include pathogens that could cause a disease,\u201d Helve says. From 90 women initially included, 54 were excluded owing to the presence of pathogens or another screening failure. \u201cEven if it sounds simple, it should be well controlled,\u201d Helve adds.",
            "Helve warns that the approach is unlikely to be a good fit for every infant born by c-section. In a large enough group of children, he says, you have enough statistical power to see that some diseases, such as asthma, are more prevalent in those born by c-section. \u201cBut on an individual level, the differences are very small.\u201d So his team is studying whether groups at high risk of developing certain diseases would benefit most.",
            "An important next step in the field, Shao says, would be to pinpoint the specific maternal gut microbes that are most likely to transmit to and colonize their babies\u2019 guts. Shao asks: \u201cIf these species do exist across human populations, wouldn\u2019t it be more effective and safer\u201d to give newborns a laboratory-made transplant that\u2019s guaranteed to be pathogen-free?",

            "Tardigrades, also known as water bears, have long fascinated scientists with their ability to withstand extreme conditions, including radiation at levels nearly 1,000 times higher than the lethal dose for humans. There are around 1,500 known tardigrade species, but only a handful are well-studied. ",

            "Now, scientists have sequenced the genome of a species new to science, and revealed some of the molecular mechanisms that give tardigrades their extraordinary resilience. Their study, published in Science on 24 October1, identifies thousands of tardigrade genes that become more active when exposed to radiation. These processes point to a sophisticated defence system that involves protecting DNA from the damage that radiation causes and repairing any breaks that do occur.",
            "The authors hope that their insights could be harnessed to help protect astronauts from radiation during space missions, clean up nuclear pollution or improve cancer treatment.",

            "Around six years ago, Zhang and his colleagues ventured into Funiu Mountain in China\u2019s Henan province to collect moss samples. Back in the laboratory and under the microscope, they identified a previously undocumented species of tardigrade, which they named Hypsibius henanensis. Genome sequencing revealed that the species had 14,701 genes, 30% of which are unique to tardigrades.",
            "When the researchers exposed H. henanensis to radiation doses of 200 and 2,000 grays \u2014 far beyond what would be survivable for humans \u2014 they found that 2,801 genes involved in DNA repair, cell division and immune responses became active.",

It\u2019s almost that level of retooling how gene expression is working,\u201d says Bob Goldstein, a cell biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has been studying tardigrades for 25 years. \u201cWe\u2019re fascinated by how an organism would change their gene expression to a point where they\u2019re making that much transcript for specific genes.\u201d",

            "The researchers also estimate that 0.5\u20133.1% of the tardigrade\u2019s genes were acquired from other organisms through a process known as horizontal gene transfer. A gene called DODA1, which seems to have been acquired from bacteria, enables tardigrades to produce four types of antioxidant pigments called betalains. These pigments can mop up some of the harmful reactive chemicals that radiation causes to form inside cells, which account for 60\u201370% of radiation\u2019s damaging effects.",
            "The authors treated human cells with one of the tardigrade\u2019s betalains and found that they were much better at surviving radiation than cells that were not treated.",

            "For the first time, researchers have accelerated muons \u2014 the heavier, unstable cousins of electrons \u2014 into a tightly controlled beam, bringing the vision of a muon collider a step closer to reality. ",
            "A team at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai shot a laser at a stream of muons to bring the fast-moving particles to a near-standstill. Then, the researchers applied an electric field to accelerate these \u2018cooled\u2019 muons to around 4% of the speed of light. The findings, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, were posted on 15 October on the arXiv preprint server1.",
            "The feat is a \u201cgreat step forward\u201d in the approach needed to build a muon collider, which could be used to make the exquisitely sensitive measurements required to uncover new physics but be smaller and potentially cheaper to build than other particle colliders, says Tova Holmes, a particle physicist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. ",
            "Muons are short-lived fundamental particles that are almost identical to electrons, but have more than 200 times the mass. Over the past decade, there has been growing momentum towards building a compact muon collider that could match or exceed the energies achieved by sprawling proton and electron colliders, such as the 27-kilometre Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Europe\u2019s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. A 10-kilometre muon collider could produce particles that have as much energy as those from a 90-kilometre proton machine, because muons are fundamental particles, which means that all of their energy goes into each collision. By contrast, proton collisions occur between their constituent quarks.",
            "h2Tricky particles",
            "But muons are fiendishly difficult to accelerate because they only exist for around 2 microseconds before they decay into an electron and two types of neutrino. They also dart around in different directions at various speeds, making them difficult to tame into a narrow, high-intensity beam. Although researchers have accelerated muons before, the beams \u201care highly divergent\u201d, says study co-author Shusei Kamioka, a particle physicist at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Tsukuba, Japan. As a result, the beams are too unruly to be used for sensitive measurements.",
            "To overcome this roadblock, Kamioka and his colleagues shot a beam of positively-charged muons \u2014 the antimatter counterpart of muons, called antimuons \u2014 into silica aerogel, a sponge-like material that\u2019s often used as a thermal insulator. When the antimuons hit electrons in the aerogel, neutral atoms of \u2018muonium\u2019 formed. The researchers fired a laser at these atoms to strip away their electrons, turning them back into antimuons that were almost frozen in place. This cooling process made the particles\u2019 speeds and directions uniform.",
            "Next, the researchers used an electric field to accelerate these slowed-down muons to an energy of 100 kiloelectronvolts, achieving a speed of around 4% that of light.",
            "Although the results are promising, there\u2019s still a long way to go before muon colliders will become a reality, says Holmes. The approach would need to be scaled up to produce even tighter, higher-intensity beams, she says.",
            "Kamioka said he and his colleagues are developing the technology needed to accelerate muons to 94% of the speed of light, and hope to achieve this by 2028. \u201cThat is our next milestone,\u201d he says.",
            "Besides building a future collider, physicists could use high-energy muon beams in experiments that could go beyond the standard model of particle physics, such as precisely measuring the muon\u2019s mysterious magnetism \u2014 which has been shown to be stronger than predicted by theory, says Kamioka.",

Other evidence suggests that the first person to become infected in the outbreak probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave that hosts a species of bat known to harbour the virus.",

Scientists praise the country\u2019s efforts to control the outbreak, investigate its origins and share data with the scientific community. \u201cAs soon as they realized it was a problem, they started contact tracing, conducted a thorough epidemiological investigation, identified the [first] patient and potentially the source of the infection \u2014 and managed to roll out an experimental vaccine trial within a week,\u201d says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. This shows that, with the Marburg virus disease, \u201ca rapid urgent response can mitigate severity of the outbreak\u201d, she adds.",

Outbreaks of Marburg \u2014 which causes high fever, severe diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and in severe cases, bleeding from the nose or gums \u2014 now occur about once a year. Before the 2020s, they were detected at most a few times each decade.",
            "Since the outbreak began, reports of new infections have dropped off notably. Rwandan health officials have recorded one new case and no deaths in the past 10 days, and only two people remain in isolation and treatment.

Health officials are offering a candidate vaccine, made by the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington DC, to the contacts of infected individuals. More than 1,200 doses have been administered so far.",
            "This outbreak has one of the lowest fatality rates \u2014 about 24% \u2014 on record for Marburg; previous outbreaks reported fatality rates as high as 90%. This is probably a result of there being quick diagnoses, access to medical care and that most infections are in relatively young health-care workers.",
            "In fact, two people who were infected with the virus and put on life support were successfully intubated and later extubated as they recovered. This marks the first time that people with Marburg virus disease have been extubated in Africa, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, said at a briefing on 20 October. \u201cThese patients would have died in previous outbreaks,\u201d he said.",

They found that all samples closely resembled one another, suggesting that the virus spread rapidly in a short period of time and that they shared a common origin. They also found that the virus strain is closely related to one detected in Uganda in 2014 and to one found in bats in 2009, Yvan Butera, Rwanda\u2019s minister of state for health, who co-led the research, tells Nature.",

Generally, viruses collect mutations as they replicate over time; if it is true that the mutation rate is low, Rasmussen wonders how the virus lingers in its animal reservoir \u2014 the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) \u2014 without major changes.",

This latest crop of competitions is drawing people from around the world into the related field of protein design by lowering the barrier to entry. It could also quicken the pace of validation and standards development and perhaps help to foster community. \u201cIt will push the field forward and test methods more quickly,\u201d says Noelia Ferruz Capapey, a computational biologist at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain.",

Since 1994, the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) has been challenging scientists to predict the 3D shape of proteins from their amino-acid sequences. Winners of the competition \u2014 founded by computational biologist John Moult at the University of Maryland in Rockville and Krzysztof Fidelis, a computational biologist at the University of California, Davis \u2014 are determined by comparing the computational predictions with unpublished structural models.",

The contests could also help to bring together some of the disparate fields that have been drawn to protein design \u2014 from biochemistry labs that pioneered protein engineering methods to machine-learning scientists who cut their teeth in natural-language processing, says Gitter. \u201cPeople organizing the competitions, to have maximum impact on the field, should think really hard about how to create a community.\u201d",
            "When the Adaptyv competition results were announced in late September, Naka was disappointed. Although all ten of his entries looked strong, none of his designs worked in the lab.

            "In almost all types of nuclear reactor, the source of energy is the splitting of uranium atoms. A nucleus of the unstable isotope uranium-235 breaks up when hit by a neutron, and this releases more neutrons, which hit more nuclei, leading to a chain reaction. A conventional nuclear power station extracts the resulting energy \u2014 released as heat \u2014 by pumping cold water through the reactor\u2019s core and producing pressurized steam to power turbines that generate electricity.",
            "X-energy\u2019s design replaces the water with helium, whereas Kairos plans to use molten salt. Both forgo the conventional nuclear-fuel rods, replacing them with thousands of round fuel \u2018pebbles\u2019. The pebbles are continually added at the top of the reactor, while spent pebbles are removed from the bottom, not unlike the way a gumball vending machine works.",
            "h2Are there safety advantages to the small modular designs?",
            "\u201cThe smallest reactors, in theory, could have a high degree of passive safety,\u201d says Lyman. When shut down, the core of a small reactor would contain less residual heat and radioactivity than does a core of the type that melted down in the Fukushima Daiichi disaster that followed the cataclysmic 2011 tsunami in Japan.",
            "The companies also say that the proposed pebble-bed reactors are inherently safer because they are not pressurized, and because they are designed to circulate cooling fluids without the help of pumps (it was the loss of power to water pumps that caused three of the Fukushima plant\u2019s reactors to fail).",
            "But Lyman thinks it is risky to rely on potentially unpredictable passive cooling without the backup of an active cooling option. And as reactors become get smaller, they become less efficient. Another start-up company, NuScale Power, based in Portland, Oregon, originally designed its small modular reactor \u2014 which was certified by the NRC \u2014 to produce 50 MW of electricity, but later switched to a larger, 77-MW design. The need to make the economics work \u201cmakes passive safety less credible\u201d, Lyman says.",

HALEU is still classified as low-enrichment fuel (as opposed to the highly enriched uranium used to make nuclear bombs), but that distinction is misleading, Lyman says. In June, he and his collaborators \u2014 including physicist Richard Garwin, who led the design of the first hydrogen bomb \u2014 warned in a Science article that a bomb could be built with a few hundred kilograms of HALEU, with no need for further enrichment1.",

In a full-size reactor, most of the neutrons produced by the splitting of uranium travel through a large volume of fuel, meaning that they have a high probability of hitting another nucleus, rather than colliding with the walls of the reactor vessel or escaping into the surrounding building. \u201cWhen you shrink the reactor, there\u2019s less material in there, so you will have more neutron leakage,\u201d Macfarlane says. These rogue neutrons can be absorbed by other atomic nuclei \u2014 which would then themselves become radioactive.",

Other assessments, including one by the International Energy Agency, suggest that in many parts of the world, it would be prohibitively expensive to rely wholly on erratic solar and wind power, even with the addition of massive batteries \u2014 and that ready-on-demand sources, including nuclear power, will still have an important role in future energy provision3.",

            "An analysis of the searching patterns of nearly half a million people browsing Wikipedia suggests that the site\u2019s users demonstrate three unique styles of curiosity.",
            "There\u2019s the \u2018hunter\u2019, who pursues specific answers, the \u2018busybody\u2019, searching for diverse nuggets of new information and the \u2018dancer\u2019, who links unrelated concepts through the process of exploration. The study, which was published in Science Advances on 25 October1, is the first to investigate this framework of curiosity outside of a laboratory environment.",
            "As the world\u2019s largest encyclopaedia, Wikipedia is a valuable resource for researchers exploring how people seek information. \u201cIt\u2019s super important to understand more about how people actually use the content online and how they consume knowledge,\u201d says Tiziano Piccardi, who researches how to improve the online information ecosystem at Stanford University in California. \u201cYou can translate what you learn to improve Wikipedia.\u201d",
            "h2Searching styles",
            "Previous research on how people navigate Wikipedia was with relatively few participants under controlled laboratory conditions. The authors of the latest study conducted one such experiment, in which they reviewed the Wikipedia browsing behaviour of 149 people, monitoring how they moved from article to article. There, they identified the hunter and busybody styles of curiosity2. Their most recent work builds on these earlier findings by using real-world data from hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia users.",
            "Edit-a-thon gets women scientists into Wikipedia",
            "The team wanted to know whether the previous study\u2019s findings were related to just the 149 participants, says co-author Dani Bassett, a human curiosity and learning researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cOr is this something that\u2019s consistent across hundreds of thousands of people, and across different languages and different countries?\u201d",
            "Working with the Wikimedia Foundation \u2014 Wikipedia\u2019s parent company based in San Francisco, California \u2014 the team reviewed two months of anonymized browsing data from more than 482,000 users of the Wikipedia mobile app from 50 countries and territories. These readers browsed articles in at least 14 languages.",
            "\u201cThe data that we have is basically how people walk through Wikipedia, moving from page to page,\u201d says Bassett. \u201cFrom that data, we were able to extract networks. So how do people move in this larger information space? Which hyperlinks do they walk across, and what do those networks look like for each person?\u201d",
            "h2Social butterflies",
            "The researchers found that they were able to generalize the curiosity styles found in their earlier study to this larger-scale analysis. They identified busybodies, who Bassett likens to social butterflies. There were also the hunters, who moved logically between different pages as if following a specific trail. The researchers also spotted a third style of curiosity \u2014 the dancer \u2014 that others had identified in earlier studies. This style applies to \u201csomebody who is moving between ideas in a way that is quite creative\u201d, says Bassett.",
            "AI science search engines are exploding in number \u2014 are they any good? ",
            "By comparing how browsing styles varied between countries, and considering global inequality metrics, the researchers also found \u201ca really strong relationship between the kind of browsing style that a person has and the level of equality in the country\u201d, Bassett says. For example, loose, diverse knowledge networks, in which users view a variety of topics, are associated with countries with lower gender and education inequality. Although Bassett stresses that the research team doesn\u2019t know what exactly is driving this correlation, they suggest several hypotheses, such as that societies that are unequal could also create conditions that constrain curiosity and people\u2019s desire to search for knowledge.",
            "\u201cThis is the first study that I see that is grounded in theory,\u201d says Piccardi. \u201cThese navigation patterns are really, really complex, so grounding it in some theories and finding a way to explore them. I think it\u2019s a good contribution.\u201d He adds that future studies could explore different aspects of the information seeking process, for example how context and time can change how a user browses Wikipedia.",

            "Bassett agrees that people might deploy different curiosity styles in different situations, but suggests that understanding a person\u2019s preferred style could help to improve teamwork. \u201cWhen we are working with one another in teams, we can be more aware of the fact that we ask questions differently and we investigate knowledge spaces differently, and embrace that diversity.\u201d",

            "Insects are an eco-friendly source of protein, but many people find the idea of eating them gross. By extracting their protein to make supplements, such as powders, manufacturers could camouflage their use in many cooked and baked foods. ",
            "Mealworms for lunch? Ewww! For many of us, that would be our first reaction to finding these beetle larvae on today\u2019s menu. But if we\u2019re not so quick to \u201cick,\u201d the protein from these insects has a lot to offer, say some researchers. That\u2019s what\u2019s behind new work to see how insect protein might be used to fortify many types of foods.",
            "Edible insects are a healthy and sustainable source of animal protein. That\u2019s why food scientists have been working to extract it \u2014 then turn it into a powder. That means diners don\u2019t have to bite into any heads, legs or wormy bodies. But some extraction methods can degrade certain health benefits of that protein.",
            "The new work seeks to prevent that. If it succeeds, it could open up new prospects for insect-based foods.\u00a0",
            "We need protein in our diets. That can come from sources such as beans, tofu, eggs or meat. Meat is high in protein. But some insect proteins may be healthier for us than the meat of larger animals, such as beef, fish or chicken. Farming insects is also better for the planet than other types of livestock. It uses less land, water and energy. And it produces fewer greenhouse gases, such as methane.",
            "Overall, \u201cinsects have shown great potential,\u201d says Yookyung Kim. She\u2019s a food scientist at Korea University in Seoul. Kim values insects\u2019 high protein content.",
            "But there\u2019s more. Many edible insects are full of vitamins and minerals. They also contain other compounds, such as amino acids and peptides, that can promote good health. In fact, some of these compounds are being studied to treat ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Extracting them from insects might lead to new health supplements.\u00a0",
            "To get there, science will have to pass a few hurdles. First is chitin (KY-tehn). It makes up the crunchy exoskeleton on many arthropods, from insects and arachnids to shellfish. Insect larvae contain some chitin, too. This sugar-based polymer binds to proteins and makes them hard to digest. So diners who eat whole insects won\u2019t get full nutritional benefit from their proteins.",
            "Treatment can separate out that chitin. Now, people can better absorb the protein.",
            "But there\u2019s still the yuck factor. Eating insects is normal in some parts of the world. Many of us don\u2019t want to eat insects, however \u2014 no matter how nutritious they may be. And it\u2019s hard to ignore that you\u2019re eating insects if you crunch on their legs or wings. That\u2019s a big reason why Kim focuses on turning the beneficial parts into a powder.",
            "Plus, she adds, powders are practical. They tend to last longer than whole insects and are easier to ship.",
            "But techniques to remove proteins can have their own problems, Kim\u2019s team has found. Most take a lot of time, money and energy. This can make it hard for a small farmer to turn insects into powder.\u00a0",
            "Kim\u2019s team decided to see if simpler, less costly methods worked. And they applied them to mealworms.",
            "Despite their name, mealworms are larvae of the darkling beetle. Kim\u2019s team tried four ways to turn proteins from these beetle larvae into powder. Then they tested how nutritional each powder was.",
            "Three techniques started by drying the larvae, then grinding them in a blender. Next, the researchers soaked the ground worms in ethanol, a type of alcohol, to break up the fats. Then, they mixed in one of three solutions to dissolve the proteins out of the defatted worms. One solution was sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Another contained a salt. The third contained enzymes. Lastly, they freeze-dried the mix to remove water. The leftover material was crushed into a powder.",
            "The fourth method was simpler. The team froze and then thawed the mealworms. Afterward, they ran the larvae through a screw press, which squished their tissue. This squeezed out any liquids. It\u2019s similar to how olive oil is extracted from whole olives. Next, the team strained the liquid and freeze-dried it (to remove water). They powdered what was left.",
            "*a_set_of_images_showing_the_steps_of_extracting_protein_from_frozen_mealworms_Frozen,_thawing,_screw",
            "fCResearchers tested four different ways to extract protein from mealworms. The simplest was the screw-press, which squeezes nutrient-rich liquid out of the larvae. Other methods used alcohol to remove fats, then separated out the proteins using alkali, salt or enzymes.  ",
            "The team analyzed how much protein, fat, amino acids and chitin were in each of these four powders.",
            "Each powder had different advantages.",
            "Powder from the screw-press technique, for instance, kept less protein but more of the fatty lipids. (Many lipids are healthful compounds that can help fight some diseases.) Other methods preserved more protein but lost some other nutrients.",
            "So different methods \u2014 or a mix of them \u2014 might be chosen to preserve more of certain target ingredients.",
            "The team shared its findings August 21 in the Journal of Food Science.",
            "Catriona Lakemond is a food scientist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. She, too, works on insect proteins for human diners. And she finds the new data interesting. People are more likely to accept eating a powder rather than a whole insect, she says. Plus, she adds, extraction allows for the protein to find a wider range of uses.",
            "Still, there remain challenges to getting these insect powders onto dinner plates, Lakemond says.",
            "It\u2019s not yet easy to find this protein \u2014 or foods made with it \u2014 at the grocery store. Lakemond wants it to be easier for farmers to grow, process and sell edible insects. And more people will need to be ready to buy foods made with insect ingredients.",
            "Food allergies are another factor, says food scientist Andrea Liceaga. People with shellfish allergies, she notes, may also be allergic to insects.",
            "Liceaga works with insect proteins at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. Her past work has shown that how protein is extracted can affect how likely it is to trigger an allergic reaction. So it will be critical to test insect-based products for allergens, she says.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/avutyyRSh4w?feature=oembed",
            "Eating mealworms is not just an idea. Some companies are already rearing enough of the beetle larvae to provide food companies with commercial quantities of their protein. See how it\u2019s done on an industrial scale and hear about the broad range of uses they imagine for this ingredient.",
            "All these food scientists imagine us one day eating more insects. Which type and how they\u2019re prepared will probably depend on people\u2019s culture, says Liceaga. But at some point, insects will become just another ingredient.",
            "And what seems gross today might soon become desirable. By way of example, she points to lobster. Today it\u2019s a pricy delicacy. But in colonial America, it was an unpopular \u201cpoor-man\u2019s food.\u201d",
            "No matter how healthy or planet-friendly insects may be, Lakemond says, one thing is key for people to eat them. \u201cWe need to make really good products with a good taste.\u201d"

That allows the newborns to start off life with a feast.",

That tells a plant which way is down, explains Anna Newman-Griffis. She studied plant biology and now teaches at Durham University in England.",
            "Root cells are programmed to grow down toward the pull of gravity. This is called positive gravitropism. Shoot cells have negative gravitropism. That tells them to grow upward, against the pull of gravity.",

            "Most plant growth takes place at the tips and along the sides of roots and shoots. These regions are called meristems. They have unspecialized cells \u2014 sometimes called stem cells. These can become any kind of cell a plant needs. For example, stem cells can make new epidermal cells for protection if a shoot is injured. Or they can become root cells to seek out water deeper in the soil. Plants use cues from inside and outside their body to know when cells should divide and what type of cells to make.",
            "Adding new cells can make a plant longer or thicker. They can build branches, flowers or leaves. They also build a plant\u2019s transport system. Its xylem carries water absorbed by roots throughout the plant. The system\u2019s phloem transports sugar, the plant\u2019s food.",
            "Like animals, plants need energy from food to grow. But plants don\u2019t eat, says Newman-Griffis. Instead, they make their own food through photosynthesis.",
            "Plants pull carbon dioxide, or CO2, from the air into their leaves through little openings called stomata. Chloroplasts inside a leaf cell absorb energy from the sun and use it to convert CO2 and water into sugar and molecules of oxygen. This oxygen returns to the air. The sugars power all the plant\u2019s cellular machinery. Sugars are also the building blocks for making new cells and tissues.",
            "Basically, Newman-Griffis says, \u201cThey\u2019re making giant trees out of air molecules.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/rEdOvBAtyYk?feature=oembed",
            "This video shows how a substantial part of plants are made from ingredients they pull out of the air.",
            "Plants need other nutrients to grow properly, too. The main ones are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Nitrogen helps make leaves and is important for photosynthesis. Phosphorus helps make roots, flowers, seeds and DNA. Potassium helps move water and nutrients through their tissues.",
            "Plant roots absorb these nutrients from the soil. They come from the breakdown of rocks and organic matter, such as dead plants and animals. All three nutrients are very common on Earth. But they exist in multiple forms, some of which plants can\u2019t use. For instance, most nitrogen exists as a gas. Microbes in the soil help convert this gas from the air into a form plants can use. This process is called nitrogen fixation.",
            "Like animal cells, plant cells divide to make new cells through a process known as mitosis. But they undertake one extra step that animals don\u2019t. In the final stage of cell division, plants build a wall around each cell. Plants don\u2019t have bones or shells. So these rigid walls protect the cells. They also give them support and structure.",
            "Plant growth differs from animal growth in another important way. Babies of most animals have a set body plan that already determines where the major parts of the body go, such as the head or a tail. Where its eyes sit on its head also tend to be fixed in advance. The same is true for how many limbs or appendages it will have and where they will emerge.",
            "Plants use more general body plans. Those plans help them look like other members of their species by following instructions from their DNA. For example, the leaves of maple trees develop characteristic pointed lobes. California poppies produce distinctive flowers with bright petals. And deer grass makes long, thin leaves, called blades, that grow in a clump and sway in the wind.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "But a plant\u2019s environment will shape its individual growth pattern and structure. Since plants can\u2019t travel, they need different ways to deal with challenges. For example, an animal may eat parts of them. New leaves or stems may now need to grow in a somewhat different spot to capture water or sunlight. Or to cope with lots of wind.",
            "Plants are constantly growing and adjusting their body plan, says Newman-Griffis. So, their structure may end up with funny twists, bends and turns.",
            "The larger a plant grows \u2014 and the longer it lives \u2014 the more carbon it will have trapped in its cells. Trapping carbon is called carbon sequestration. This important process reduces the amount of greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere. And that plays a role in helping control Earth\u2019s climate.",

            "The large trees in old-growth forests can live for hundreds or thousands of years. They will have trapped huge amounts of carbon in their giant bodies.

Craters are what make our moon look like Swiss cheese. Each round hole is the place where a meteorite\u00a0impacted, or hit, the surface of the moon, so craters are often called\u00a0impact craters. Often, the meteorite that creates a crater explodes on impact, so the crater is an empty reminder of the collision.",

            "On Earth, we only see a few impact craters, for a couple of different reasons. First, most meteoroids never reach the Earth\u2019s surface because they burn up in the atmosphere. This is what we are seeing when we watch a\u00a0shooting star\u00a0during a\u00a0meteor shower\u00a0(meteor\u00a0refers to the visible streak of light). Second, impact craters from meteorites can be changed by geological forces (like earthquakes and continental movements) or eroded away by atmospheric forces (like wind or rain). There is no atmosphere on the moon, which means that falling meteoroids do not burn up and there is no weather to erode away the craters. In fact, the footprints of the astronauts who landed on the moon over 50 years ago are still there!",

Not all of them are obvious because most are eroded, covered by sediment or under water. Each crater has to be identified using several different kinds of clues. First, geological clues are found by looking for pieces of the exploded, iron-rich meteorite or for glass that formed during the impact. Satellite imaging can be used to visualize crater formations that are beneath the Earth\u2019s surface or a body of water. Finally, chemical evidence is used to date the crater and find traces of elements that are more common in space than on our planet.",

            "Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth\u2019s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.",
            "Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",
            "Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth\u2019s inner structure. They\u2019ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists \u2014 \u00a0including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago \u2014 have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth\u2019s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",

            "This solid metal ball has a radius of 1,220 kilometers (758 miles), or about three-quarters that of the moon. It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",
            "*a_photo_of_the_Himalayan_mountains",
            "fCThe thickest part of Earth\u2019s crust is about 70 kilometers (43 miles) thick and lies under the Himalayan Mountains, seen here.",
            "Earth\u2019s crust is like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. It is extremely thin, cold\u00a0and brittle compared to what lies below it. The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "A shadowy figure rushed through the door. \u201cIt had a skeletal body, surrounded by a white, blurry aura,\u201d recalls Dom. The figure hovered and didn\u2019t seem to have a face. Dom, who prefers to use only his first name, had been fast asleep. Just 15 at the time, he panicked and closed his eyes. \u201cI only saw it for a second,\u201d he recalls. Now, he\u2019s a young adult who lives in the United Kingdom. But he still remembers the experience vividly.",
            "Was the figure a ghost? In the mythology of the United States and many other Western cultures, a ghost or spirit is a dead person who interacts with the living world. In stories, a ghost may whisper or groan, cause things to move or fall, mess with electronics \u2014 even appear as a shadowy, blurry or see-through figure.",

            "fC\u201cI\u2019d been hearing noises on the ceiling at the same time each night,\u201d says Clare Llewellyn-Bailey, who is now a student at the University of South Wales. One night, a big thud prompted her to grab her camera. This was the first picture she took. Other photos she took on that and later nights showed nothing unusual. Does this story make it seem like ghosts exist? Or is the glowing figure a flash of light that the camera accidentally captured?",
            "Ghost stories are lots of fun, especially on Halloween. But some people believe that ghosts are real. Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",
            "On ghost-hunting TV shows, people use scientific equipment to attempt to record or measure spirit activity. And numerous creepy photos and videos make it seem like ghosts exist. However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",
            "Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager.",
            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",
            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",
            "*a_wall_with_three_bricks_that_look_like_they_have_faces",
            "fCCan you see the three faces in this image? Most people can easily find them. Most people also realize that they aren\u2019t real faces. They are an example of pareidolia.",
            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo?feature=oembed",
            "This video was part of a famous 1999 study into inattentional blindness. While you watch it, count the number of times people in white shirts pass a basketball.",
            "Partway through the video, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the players. Did you see it? About half of all viewers who count passes while watching the video miss the gorilla completely.",
            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",
            "*a_woman_sitting_on_a_chair_looking_at_a_ghost_twin_image_sitting_in_front_of_a_window",
            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",
            "Wait, what\u2019s that behind you? (Boo!)",

Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",

            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",
            "*a_girl_explaining_something_to_her_mom",
            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",

            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

            "All of the metal weights shown here are made from the same material. But gravity is pulling the right side of this balance scale farther down than the left side. This shows that the total mass of the metal weights on the right side is greater. ",
            "In everyday life, we often use the words \u201cmass\u201d and \u201cweight\u201d as if they\u2019re the same. But in science, it\u2019s important to be precise. Mass and weight are both measurements that describe heaviness, but they actually mean very different things. Let\u2019s be specific!",
            "Mass is a measurement of the amount of matter in some object. It depends only on what type of atoms the object is made of, and how many atoms there are. Mass is traditionally measured in kilograms (kg). A pineapple or a wooden baseball bat each have a mass of about 1 kilogram. \u00a0",
            "If you were to measure out 1 kilogram of steel and 1 kilogram of feathers, they would each have the same mass. But their volumes would differ. You\u2019d need a far bigger volume of feathers because most of the elements they\u2019re made from are lighter than those in steel. It takes more of those atoms to build up the same mass \u2014 which takes up more space.",
            "People in the United States rarely describe objects using kilograms in daily life. Scientists and doctors use this term because it is the standard unit of mass in the metric system. (A standard unit is a definition that all scientists agree on.) \u00a0\u00a0",
            "You can change an object\u2019s mass by removing some of its parts. When you take books out of your backpack at the end of a school day, you\u2019ve decreased the backpack\u2019s mass. Mass can also change by adding more matter. When a child grows, their body is building longer bones and bigger organs. The child\u2019s mass will increase because they are transforming food energy into matter for their body.",
            "It\u2019s important to know that mass doesn\u2019t change by varying its shape, location or size. Your body\u2019s mass is the same when you\u2019re curled up on the sofa or when you stretch as high as you can. And it\u2019s the same when you\u2019re at home or at the beach or at school! But your mass is a little bit more after you\u2019ve eaten breakfast, compared with when you first wake up in the morning. Mass is a fundamental measurement of how much matter an object contains.",

            "fCAstronaut John Young bounded across the lunar surface during the Apollo 16 mission in April 1972. His space suit more than doubled Young\u2019s mass. The moon\u2019s gravity is so weak, however, that he could still jump easily.",
            "Weight is a measurement of the gravitational force on an object. It not only depends on the object\u2019s mass, but also on its location. Therefore, weight is actually a measure of force. In the United States, most people measure weight in pounds.",
            "Let\u2019s say that your body has a mass of 40 kilograms. Your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, on the moon, on Jupiter \u2014 and even floating inside the International Space Station. Your mass is 40 kilograms no matter where you are. But your weight differs from place to place because of differences in how hard gravity at each site pulls on you. On Earth\u2019s surface, 1 kilogram of mass is equivalent to 2.2 pounds of weight. So your 40-kilogram mass on Earth would weigh 40 x 2.2 \u2014 or 88 pounds.",
            "Language can get tricky here. Scientifically, you shouldn\u2019t say, \u201cMy doctor measured my weight as 40 kilograms,\u201d because weight isn\u2019t the same as mass. It would be similarly incorrect to say, \u201cMy doctor measured my mass as 88 pounds.\u201d However, since we all experience the same strength of Earth\u2019s gravity on our mass, in casual language we often use mass and weight interchangeably. In much the same way, most people feel comfortable describing mass in pounds and weight in kilograms.",
            "To avoid this confusion, scientists use a standard unit for force. It\u2019s called the newton (in honor of Isaac Newton). On Earth, 100 newtons of weight (a force) is equal to about 22 pounds. This is a measure of how hard Earth\u2019s gravity pulls on a mass of about 10 kilograms.",

            "fCThis photo of a nighttime launch of a space shuttle shows how big its engines and rocket boosters are. Rockets need much more power in the first few minutes after launch than they do later.",
            "As the mass of something rises or falls, its weight will change in the same way. And if the gravitational force on something rises or falls, its weight will also. In short, the mass of something rarely changes, but there are multiple ways its weight can change. \u00a0",
            "The gravity you\u2019d feel on the surface of a planet depends on its density. We say that Earth has the gravitational force of one \u201cG.\u201d The moon is much smaller and less dense than Earth. Its gravity is one-sixth G. Although Jupiter is much, much bigger than Earth, it\u2019s not very dense. So Jupiter\u2019s gravity is 2.5 G.",
            "If your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, your 88-pound weight would drop to 15 pounds on the moon. On Jupiter, you\u2019d weigh 220 pounds. On the International Space Station, floating in orbit, your weight would be zero. But your mass would stay the same \u2014 40 kg \u2014 in all of these places. For that reason, mass is a fundamental property of matter and weight is not.",
            "Rocket launches offer an interesting example of how mass and weight relate. At launch, the rocket is full of fuel, so its mass is greatest. At Earth\u2019s surface, it also feels the maximum pull of gravity. So its weight is heaviest. A few minutes after launch, the rocket has burned through a huge portion of its fuel. This means it has lost mass as that fuel has been transformed into energy. In addition, the rocket is farther from Earth\u2019s surface. Gravity therefore pulls on it with even less force. Both the rocket\u2019s mass and its weight have dropped. The rocket\u2019s engines can now push the rocket even faster than they could at launch. (Next time you watch a rocket launch, notice how huge those launch engines are!)"

            "Millions of Americans will be lining up to vote on November 8. Millions will also stay home. But scientists have insight into how to convince people to vote.",
            "Every two years, on the first Tuesday (after a Monday) in November, Americans should head to the polls to take part in a national election. Some important elections may take part in the off-years as well. But not everyone who is eligible to vote will do so. In fact, millions of people won\u2019t. And that\u2019s a problem because people who don\u2019t vote lose out on a prime chance to register their views. Also, voting isn\u2019t just important. It is a privilege and a right that many people throughout the world lack.",
            "One person\u2019s vote probably won\u2019t change course of an election. But a few thousand votes \u2014 or even a few hundred \u2014 certainly can. Consider, for instance, the famous election between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000. Once the polling was over, Florida had to recount its votes. In the end, Bush won by 537 votes. That difference decided who became president of the United States.",
            "Even in polling for local offices \u2014 such as a school board \u2014 the result of a vote can change everything from what schools neighborhood children will attend to whether their textbooks will cover evolution.",
            "There are many reasons why people don\u2019t vote.\u00a0And to counter the anger, apathy, fatigue and other factors that deter many folks from voting, organizations big and small mount campaigns urging people to go to the polls. Facebook users may plead with their friends. Politicians may hire phone banks to call thousands of people in states where a race appears to be very competitive. Celebrities may beg over YouTube. Does any of this really work?",
            "Political scientists have studied ways to change people\u2019s voting behavior. These four methods seem to stand out in terms of being most effective.",
            "1) Educate early and well\u00a0\u00a0 Messages that people receive early in life have a strong impact on whether people vote, notes Donald Green. He\u2019s a political scientist at Columbia University in New York City. Parents and teachers should therefore let kids know \u201cvoting is important,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes you a functioning adult.\u201d Teachers might help deliver this message in classes where students learn about how their country and government functions. That happened to me in high school when my own teacher one day begged me and my classmates to vote.",
            "People with college degrees are also more likely to vote. Perhaps society should make it easier for people to afford college. \u201cA person who gets a college education ends up in a different life circumstance,\u201d explains Barry Burden. He\u2019s a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. College graduates tend to associate more with people who vote \u2014 and then they vote, too. They also stand to earn more (paying more taxes), data have shown. So a more educated population should be a win-win for society.",
            "2) Peer pressure\u00a0 \u00a0A healthy dose of name and shame can have a big effect on Election Day. Green and his colleagues demonstrated this in a study published in 2008 in American Political Science Review. They applied a little social pressure to voters.",
            "Right before Michigan\u2019s 2006 Republican primary, the researchers selected a group of 180,000 potential voters. They mailed about 20,000 voters a letter asking them to do their \u201ccivic duty\u201d and vote. They mailed another 20,000 a different letter. It asked them to do their civic duty, but added that they were being studied \u2014 and that their votes were a matter of public record. (In some states, such as Michigan, voting records are publicly available after an election.) A third group got the same messages as the second group. But they also got a note that showed them their previous voting record, and the previous voting records of the people in their household. A fourth group got the same information as the third group, as well as being shown the publicly available voting records of their neighbors. The last 99,000 people or so were a control \u2014 they got no mailings at all.",
            "*350_inline_Voting2pngpng",
            "fCWhen many Americans vote on November 8, they will go into small, curtained stalls to keep their choices private.",
            "After all the votes were counted, the scientists saw a 1.8 percentage point increase in turnout by people who had been reminded to vote over those who did not get such a mailing. For the group told their votes were a matter of public record, there was a 2.5 percentage point increase. But the biggest increase were among those shown voting records. Turnout increased by 4.9 percentage points among people shown their previous voting records. And if voters were also shown their neighbors voting records, turnout at the polls rose a whopping 8.1 percentage points.",
            "Although shaming may get out the vote, Green cautions that it likely also burns bridges. \u201cI think it produces backlash,\u201d he says. In the 2008 study, many of the people who received the letter that showed the voting records of their neighbors called the number on the mailing and asked to be left alone.",
            "Peer pressure doesn\u2019t always have to be mean, though. Asking friends directly to pledge to vote \u2014 and then making sure they do \u2014 might be effective, Green says. The most effective thing to do, he says, may be to say to a close friend or coworker, \u201clet\u2019s walk to the polls together.\u201d",
            "3) Healthy competition\u00a0 \u201cPeople are going to participate when they think they are going to make a difference,\u201d says Eyal Winter. An economist, he works at the University of Leicester in England and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He notes that there is higher voter turnout when an election is close and there\u2019s no telling who might win. Winter compares elections to football or baseball games. When two close rivals face off, their competitions will draw much bigger crowds than when one team is sure to roll right over another. \u00a0",
            "To find out whether a close election might make more people vote than a race where one politician is far behind another, Winter and his colleague looked at U.S. elections for state governors from 1990 to 2005. When surveys before the election showed that results were likely to be very close, voter turnout increased. Why? People now felt their vote might make a bigger difference.",
            "More voters also turned out for the side with the slight majority in the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer to support your team when you\u2019re expected to win,\u201d Winter explains. He and his colleague Esteban Klor \u2014 a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem \u2014 published their findings in 2006 on the Social Science Research Network.",
            "4) The personal touch\u00a0\u00a0 Hundreds of studies have been done on what gets people to vote. Some of the studies might be partisan \u2014 focusing on people who support a particular party. Others might focus on both major parties or even on people in general. Such research has probed everything from the how much money to spend on voicemail messages to crafting the ideal subject line for an email.",
            "Many of these ideas are described in Get out the Vote: How to increase voter turnout. This book was written by Green and his colleague Alan Gerber of Yale University in New Haven, Conn. The 2015 version of the book includes chapters on social media, mailing letters to people\u2019s houses and putting signs along highways. Letters and signs, computerized phone calls and Facebook posts all seem to help a little. But the most effective methods employ face-to-face and one-on-one discussions of the candidates, Green says. For politicians this means walking door to door (or having volunteers do it).",
            "But maybe someone just wants to get a sister or friend to vote. In that case, Green says the most effective message might be to convey your own enthusiasm for the candidates, the issues and how much you\u2019d like to see that person vote.",
            "Appealing directly to friends and family might help them get to the polls on Election Day. But keep in mind that everyone has their own opinions on the candidates. Even if you get your friends and family members to vote, they might not vote the way you\u2019d like them to."

To do this, the computer sifts through a vast network of nouns. This network has been built from facts found in the \u201cinfobox\u201d on the right side of every Wikipedia page.

And Facebook is open to using other signs to rout possible hoaxes, notes its spokesperson Lauren Svensson.",

A human still has to review that text, however. Her role: looking for missed details, such as spelling errors or words the program just got wrong. Similarly, computers could compile lists of suspect articles for people to check, Kasprak says. Here, people would then be asked to offer the final assessment of what reads true.",
            "Even as computers get better at flagging bogus stories, there\u2019s no guarantee that fake news creators won\u2019t step up their game to stay just ahead of the truth cops.

The computer focused on tweets mentioning a particular news event. It then sorted those posts into two groups: tweets that expressed support for the story and those that opposed it. The system then considered several factors to judge how truthful the posts were likely to be. If, for example, the story centered on a local event, the user\u2019s input was seen as more credible than a comment from someone far away. The computer also judged as suspicious the frequent tweets on a story by someone who had not tweeted for a long time. It used other factors, too, to sift through tweets.",
            "Cao\u2019s group tested their system on 73 real and 73 fake stories. (They had been labeled as such by organizations such as Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run News Agency.)

            "A computer might even look at how the story is getting passed around on social media. Li at Beihang University and his colleagues studied the shape of the networks that branch out from news stories on social media. The researchers reviewed reposted stories and the networks of readers that they involved for some 1,700 fake and 500 true news stories on Weibo. They did the same for about 30 fake and 30 true news networks on Twitter. On both social-media sites, Li\u2019s team found, most people tend to repost real news straight from a single source. The same was not true for fake news. These stories tended to spread more through people reposting from other reposters.",

He\u2019s a data analyst at SSON Analytics in Singapore.",
            "Internet sites could put warning signs on stories they suspect of being untrue. But labeling such stories may have an unfortunate effect. It may cause people to think that the remaining unlabeled stories are all true. In fact, they may simply have not been reviewed by a fact-checker. This was the conclusion, anyway, of research posted last year on the Social Science Research Network. Gordon Pennycook in Canada at the University of Regina, and David Rand of Yale University in New Haven, Conn., conducted the study.",
            "Facebook has taken a different approach. It shows debunked stories lower in a user\u2019s news feeds. And that can cut a false article\u2019s future views by as much as 80 percent, company spokesperson Svensson says. Facebook also displays articles that debunk false stories whenever users encounter the related stories. That technique, however, may backfire. Zollo in Venice, Italy, works with Walter Quattrociocchi. They conducted a study of Facebook users who like and share conspiracy news. And after these readers interacted with debunking articles, they actually increased their activity on Facebook\u2019s conspiracy pages, they reported this past June.",

As the old saying goes: A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth has put on its shoes. But keen-eyed computer programs may at least slow down fake stories with some new ankle weights."

            "Herpetologist Carlos Jared of the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, has been studying these animals for years. After hatching, ringed caecilian babies live with their mothers for two months. Jared and his research team found that the babies spent much of their time around the end of their mom\u2019s body. That\u2019s where there\u2019s an opening called a vent. It\u2019s shared by mom\u2019s reproductive, digestive and urinary systems.",

            "Earth\u2019s atmosphere has five layers. We live in the troposphere. It\u2019s the lowest one. It also has the densest air. The stratosphere, right above it, has thinner air. It also contains different chemicals than those in our layer.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists had thought most new atmospheric particles form in the upper troposphere. Clouds would rise into this region and then shed rain. That rain would carry away the existing particles. Gases left behind would have almost no solid particles left to glom onto. So new clouds would not develop until new particles formed.",
            "In the new study, researchers looked at data collected during a series of flights by NASA aircraft. Many particles are formed when the stratosphere dips a toe into the upper troposphere, they found. They call this stratospheric air intrusion.

The troposphere also contains molecules such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), emitted by fossil fuels and volcanoes. Sunlight and water vapor cause these chemicals to react in ways that generate chemicals such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a building block of tiny aerosol particles. Previous research had suggested that the main way new particles formed were instead \u201ccloud outflows\u201d \u2014 regions where high troposphere clouds break up.",

            "Climate change is expected to speed up stratospheric circulation. In the future, that could cause the stratosphere to poke into the troposphere more frequently. If it does, stratospheric intrusion may become even more important in forming new particles, Wang says.",

In other words, these particles may play a bigger role than scientists once thought in how incoming sunlight is distributed on Earth. That includes how much of the sun\u2019s rays reach the planet\u2019s surface. It also includes how much of the sun\u2019s energy aerosols and clouds absorb high in the atmosphere."

            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",

            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",

He\u2019s also the chief executive officer of Algenesis Materials. To break down the microplastics, \u201cyou need them to be wet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you break that cycle, even for a short period of time, you kill the microorganisms.\u201d",

            "When microbes break down plant materials, such as cellulose, they release carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. The researchers decided to compare the CO2 output of microbes dining on the new microplastic to when they ate cellulose.",
            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",
            "The scientists also coated a piece of fabric in the new plastic. After being mixed with the compost for two weeks, that fabric easily broke apart. Another piece of the coated fabric was not composted. It was still intact after two weeks.",

            "Polyurethane is sometimes used to coat natural fibers, like wool and cotton, for clothing, Erdle says. Over time, that plastic coating flakes off, \u201cfragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces and never going away.\u201d Having something that can readily be broken down by bacteria, she says, is better than \u201chaving persistent plastic in the environment.\u201d",

These might, for example, replace materials currently used in food packaging, he says. And then \u201cyou just chuck that thing in a compost pile and it becomes mulch in about 90 days.\u201d",

            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",
            "But it\u2019s difficult to study how materials behave under the extreme conditions required for fusion. And that\u2019s where the mayonnaise comes in.",
            "The behavior of the fuel capsule in fusion experiments, it turns out, has a lot in common with mayonnaise. The fuel capsule is a metal or other material that contains a gas (the fuel). When lasers hit the capsule, it melts. The melty capsule can now switch from elastic to plastic.",
            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Two mechanical engineers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., wanted to understand that better. So they looked at how mayo mixes with a gas \u2014 air. Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",

Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",

The pushes cause a local compression of the air (increase in air pressure), and the pulls cause a local rarefaction of the air (decrease in air pressure). The compressions and rarefactions are rapidly transmitted through the air from the original source as a wave and are commonly called a sound wave.

For some, this medicine provides relief. However, patients can suffer bad side effects from the drug. These include hallucinations and paranoia.",

That means the law doesn\u2019t recognize it as having any value in medicine and that it could harm people instead.",

Plankton are at the base of the ocean food chain, feeding fish that feed billions of people. They are responsible for half of the world\u2019s oxygen supply and half of our planet\u2019s annual carbon sink. Miniscule but powerful, their presence can help or hinder ecosystems \u2014 by soaking up greenhouse gas, for example, or by spewing toxins. Where plankton live, how many there are, when they bloom and which species dominate each play a huge role in this delicate balance. And our changing climate is spurring a sea change in all of it.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re headed into an ocean and, for that matter, a world that we\u2019re not going to recognize because it\u2019s changing so fundamentally,\u201d says David Hutchins, a marine microbiologist at the University of Southern California, who has charted plankton\u2019s future.\n",
            "Climate change is hitting our oceans hard, making them warmer and more acidic, while radically altering currents. The outlook for plankton is mixed. Some studies report overall plankton numbers dropping, while others show them rising in some major ocean basins. As the planet warms, the diversity of the menagerie in many spots is increasing, says Clare Ostle, a marine biogeochemist at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. But certain species are losing out, she adds, including big juicy plankton thought to be important for food webs and carbon sequestration. And, in the long term, plankton numbers may plummet as climate change starves them of nutrients.\n",
            "BQScientists are shocked by the knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says one expert.",

They have some new technologies at their disposal, including a new NASA satellite called PACE \u2014 for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem \u2014 launched this February. And some old ones, including a decades-old program that painstakingly trawls the ocean with filters to scoop up tiny creatures and count them by hand. Yet scientists say they are shocked by the size of our knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "The Ocean Stewardship Coalition this month released a \u201cplankton manifesto\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, highlighting how important plankton are alongside how little we know about them. \u201cThe planetary importance of plankton remains largely ignored,\u201d the group writes, alongside a plea for more research, education, and discussion in international treaties about plankton\u2019s plight.\n",
            "The word \u201cplankton,\u201d from the Greek for \u201cwanderer,\u201d is a catchall for the host of tiny creatures that live in fresh or salty water and drift where the currents take them. That includes plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and things that blur the lines between categories in a way that land-dwelling organisms typically don\u2019t. There are phytoplankton that feed on sunlight and CO2, including glassy diatoms, dinoflagellates with whip-like tendrils, and spherical coccolithophores that are struggling against ocean acidification to build hard calcite shells. Others are zooplankton \u2014 tiny animals including shelled foraminifera, along with fish larvae, tiny worms, and even jellyfish. Some have a lifespan of just days; others, years.",

Phytoplankton seem better able to cope with gradual warming than zooplankton, Benedetti says, so their habitat range and diversity looks set to increase in most regions. But that\u2019s not necessarily good news: the most productive ocean regions, counterintuitively, have low diversity, Benedetti notes. And more diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher numbers of plankton overall.",
            "In the long term, researchers fear an overall decline in plankton numbers thanks to a dwindling supply of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and iron. Plankton typically rely on nutrients that have been mixed from the ocean bottom up to the surface. But melting polar ice and changing ocean currents are now increasing the density difference between top, fresh waters and deeper, saltier waters, making these layers ever-less-likely to mix. This increased \u201cstratification,\u201d as it is called, is expected to starve ever-more regions of the ocean. While some coastal regions are drowning in too much nitrogen, which runs off agricultural fields, much of the open ocean might become \u201cmore desert-like,\u201d says Hutchins.\n",
            "BQScientists have investigated dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. ",
            "A factor working against this trend is pollution from both the burning of fossil fuels and from wildfires, which can carry nutrients far out into ocean waters. The wildly destructive Australian wildfire season of 2019-2020, for example, poured so much nutritional iron into the water that phytoplankton concentrations doubled between New Zealand and South America, creating an algae bloom bigger than Australia that lasted for months. The biggest surprise was how long the blooms lasted, says Jakob Weis at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, who studied the phenomenon. The amount of carbon soaked up by those organisms is thought to have roughly matched the carbon spewed by the fires \u2014 a helpful factor in the context of climate change. \u201cWe intentionally refrained from framing the blooms as \u2018good news,\u2019 given the devastating impact the wildfires had on the Australian public, wildlife, terrestrial ecosystems, and climate,\u201d says Weis. But the plankton, at least, were \u201chappy.\u201d",
            "Such nutrient influxes could be a big deal, says Hutchins, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where waters are particularly starved of iron. But the long-term impacts are entirely unclear. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s going to balance out some of what\u2019s not mixing up from below, or if it\u2019s going to select for different communities, different species, because it\u2019s chemically different [food],\u201d says Hutchins. Such blooms won\u2019t make a big dent in the big-picture fight against global warming, adds Ostle. \u201cWe\u2019ve burned thousands of years of deposits of oil and gas. The phytoplankton blooms aren\u2019t going to be able to cut it.\u201d\n",

But early tests suggested that such a geoengineering scheme might not be very effective at burying carbon in the seabed for the longterm, while being expensive and difficult to carry out \u2014 not to mention the possibly huge, unknown consequences for ocean life. There have been international moratoria against large-scale commercial fertilization efforts since 2008, but research into the idea continues. Just last month, Ken Buesseler at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and colleagues laid out a research agenda for how to best assess this strategy\u2019s possible risks and benefits. \u201cYou learn a lot from these experiments,\u201d says Benedetti, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t see this as a long-term solution.\u201d",
            "In the face of so much uncertainty, it\u2019s vital for researchers to get on-the-ground data about how plankton are faring. The longest-running program to do this is the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, an effort that has been attaching collection devices onto ocean-crossing ships since the 1930s. The technique is simple: Plankton get scooped out of surface waters and squashed onto a filter like bugs on a car windscreen. The filter rolls up as the ship moves along, creating a scroll-like record of plankton roadkill from across the ship\u2019s track. Those filters are delivered to a lab where they are unspooled and the plankton peered at through a microscope. About a dozen workers at the Marine Biological Association, the effort\u2019s headquarters, have been trained to identify more than 600 different types of tiny creature \u2014 a task they are now trying to bolster with artificial intelligence algorithms.\n",
            "BQIn the Atlantic around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining by around 10 percent per decade. ",
            "The vast majority of the CPR\u2019s data comes from the North Atlantic \u2014 a well-travelled region that happens to play an oversized role in global carbon uptake. Ostle, who heads up the Pacific Branch of the CPR, says the data here shows plankton biomass increasing near the pole and decreasing closer to the tropics, as expected.",
            "Most of the increase is, interestingly, diatoms, says Ostle \u2014 large, round phytoplankton that form juicy food balls for fish and which tend to sink quickly, making them good carbon storage bombs. \u201cIt was a surprise to see this,\u201d says Ostle. It\u2019s an important shift: \u201cDiatoms are really the engines of carbon fixation,\u201d says Hutchins, who estimates they are responsible for about half of phytoplanktons\u2019 total carbon uptake.\n",
            "Ostle suspects the explanation behind the unexpected North Atlantic diatom boom lies with sunlight. The increased ocean stratification that can stop nutrients from mixing upwards has also managed to trap diatoms in surface waters that are bathed in more light; they stay in the growing zone for longer. Eventually, says Ostle, the food disadvantage of increased stratification will likely outweigh the light advantage. But when and how remains uncertain.",

            "The story varies from region to region. In the northeast Atlantic, around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining at rates of around 10 percent per decade. Some researchers have even suggested that the infamous North Sea cod crash in the 1990s, usually attributed to overfishing, was exacerbated by a plankton deficit. In the Arctic Ocean, though, plankton numbers have blossomed, with productivity increasing by more than half between 1998 and 2018, thanks not just to more open water from melting ice but also to increased nutrients, possibly introduced to the Arctic by storms and shifting currents.",
            "There\u2019s less data in the North Pacific and in the subtropics, but both are now starting to show an important shift away from large diatoms towards dinoflagellates, says Ostle. These smaller creatures are less nutritious; fish have to work harder to eat more of them. \u201cThat could have really big implications for the fisheries. We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "Dinoflagellates are also the plankton responsible for bioluminescence \u2014 and, sometimes, for generating biotoxins that lead to shellfish poisoning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting big bioluminescent blooms off of Southern California,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty if you go out for a walk on the beach at night and the waves are all lighting up, but they also have toxins,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they [dinoflagellates] are going to be one of the winners too, in in the future warmer ocean.\u201d",
            "BQIt takes decades to see long-term climate change impacts in plankton, which are so variable from year to year. ",
            "Ostle has just taken on the job of chair of the Global Alliance CPR Surveys to help create a more comprehensive global picture of how plankton is faring. But it\u2019s hard, she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have funding at the moment to maintain this thing, so we do it voluntarily.\u201d While there are a dozen regional CPR surveys around the world, there are still huge swaths of the ocean where there\u2019s no regular plankton monitoring.",
            "Researchers can try to plug the gaps using satellites. But it takes decades to see long-term climate change impacts in plankton, which are so variable from season to season and year to year. Satellites typically measure color at the surface \u2014 a proxy for how chlorophyl-packed phytoplankton are doing.",
            "Last year, researchers reported that data from NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite showed that more than half of the world\u2019s oceans have gotten greener over the past 20 years. \u201cThat was a very nonintuitive finding for a lot of the community,\u201d says Hutchins. The implications are unclear. \u201cA \u2018greening\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily imply an increase in plankton abundance or productivity,\u201d says B.B. Cael of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, who led that work. \u201cWe tried to caution against this [interpretation], but I don\u2019t think the message got across.\u201d Instead, Cael says, the color change might be due to shifts from one kind of plankton to another.",

It can \u201csee\u201d in more than a hundred hues, rather than just the handful that previous satellites could spot. That should let researchers identify some specific species or groups of plankton, says Cecile Rousseaux, PACE science lead at NASA Goddard. \u201cIt tells us not just total phytoplankton, but who is in there, what type of plankton,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new level of information.\u201d",
            "Meanwhile research continues \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty to unravel. Scientists must figure out not just which plankton species are where but also exactly when, since shifts in bloom timing can also have big knock-on effects for fisheries, says Ostle. And, she adds, the viruses that attack plankton seem to be on the rise as waters warm \u2014 another factor with as-yet unknown consequences.",
            "Thankfully, says Hutchins, plankton have proven to be pretty robust and adaptable over billions of years of Earth\u2019s history \u2014 so the oceanic food chain will persist in one form or another. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to drive ocean life to extinction,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be different dominant species \u2014 and maybe they\u2019re not going to be the ones we wish were there.\u201d",

            "About 18 months ago, climate scientists began to notice something strange. In March of 2023, global sea surface temperatures started to rise. In a warming world, the seas would be expected to grow hotter, but the rise, which came at a time when the Pacific Ocean was in the neutral phase of the weather pattern known as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, was unusually steep. In April, 2023, sea surface temperatures set a new record. They did so again in May.\n",
            "As the months went on, the weirdness continued. In the summer of 2023, the world entered an El Ni\u00f1o, the warm phase of ENSO. El Ni\u00f1os typically bring higher temperatures, but in the second half of 2023, both sea surface and air temperatures increased so much that scientists were stunned. One called the figures \u201cabsolutely gobsmackingly bananas.\u201d\n",
            "In an essay that appeared in Nature this past March, NASA\u2019s chief climate scientist, Gavin Schmidt said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists\u2019 predictive capabilities more than 2023 has.\u201d\n",
            "Officially, the El Ni\u00f1o ended in May 2024. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high. This year they are expected to set yet another record.",
            "Schmidt says that scientists still can\u2019t explain the unexpected spike in temperatures. When I talked with him recently, he called the continuing confusion \u201ca little embarrassing\u201d for researchers.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/16359609/embed",
            "Scientists have identified several recent developments that could have contributed to the last year and a half of anomalous warmth. The first is a set of rules that reduced the sulfur content of the fuel used in super tankers. Since sulfur dioxide pollution reflects sunlight, this change, while good for public health, could have led to increased ocean heating. ",
            "A second potential contributor is an unusual eruption that occurred in January 2022. Normally, volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide and so produce temporary cooling. But the eruption of Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2018apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific, sent water vapor shooting into the stratosphere, which could have had a warming effect.",
            "Yet another possible contributor is the solar cycle. The sun is currently at, or near, a peak of activity, and this, too, could be boosting temperatures.",
            "At this point, though, Schmidt says, none of these developments \u2014 or even a combination of all of them \u2014 seems sufficient to explain the heat. This, in turn, raises several other possibilities. The recent temperature run-up could be the result of some development that\u2019s yet to be identified. Or it could mean the climate system is more unpredictable than was thought. Alternatively, it could indicate that something is missing from climate models, or that amplifying feedbacks are kicking in sooner than the models had predicted.\n",

We expected that 2023 would be another warm year because all of the years are warm now, but it probably wasn\u2019t going to be a record-warm year. So when the records started to be broken, first in the North Atlantic in March and April, June, and then the global mean in June, and then throughout the rest of the year, and then absolutely ridiculously large record-breaking events in the fall \u2014 August, September, October, November \u2014 people started using adjectives that scientists don\u2019t generally tend to use.",
            "At the end of 2023, we summed it up: It was a record warm year and it was a record-breaking size of the record. Our eyebrows at this point were rolling over the top of our heads. It was clear that the predictions that people had made at the beginning of year were all wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter what the method was, they were all wrong, and they were all wrong by about 0.2 degrees Celsius. Now that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a big deal. ",
            "You can accommodate a missed prediction in two ways. You can either say, your actual prediction was wrong. Or you can say, no, we underestimated the uncertainty.\n",
            "So at the beginning of 2024, we thought: Hopefully we\u2019ll get some more information from people doing science for all the different things that were happening. And maybe we\u2019ll get some more analyses of the internal variability. Some of that has happened, but not in a coordinated way. And it\u2019s still pretty much, I would say, amateur hour in terms of assessing what actually happened in 2023.",

It put a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is normally super dry. That was a very new thing, and people were saying, well, maybe that\u2019s contributing.",
            "People were also talking about unusual behavior of the Saharan dust or the wind pattern in the North Atlantic. People were talking about long-term, ongoing changes in how much pollution is coming from China and India. Maybe those things are changing faster than we anticipated. The pollution in the air is a cooling factor, and so if you take it away, then that\u2019s a warming factor.",
            "The science that\u2019s been done has not been equally spread amongst all of those things. A lot of people have looked at the impact of the marine shipping regulation change. If you take that and you put it into some climate model and you estimate the temperature change, right now you\u2019d expect about 0.05 of a degree, 0.08 of a degree [of warming per year], and then building over a decade to about 0.1 degree. So that seems like it helps, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s sufficient. And the first paper that came out about the volcano, they said, no, no, the normal cooling volcanic pollution is still bigger than the warming water vapor component. So now I have more warming to explain and less things to explain it.\n",

            "Schmidt: Like I said, there\u2019s two reasons why you could have messed up the prediction. One is you are missing some driving element. Another is you are underestimating the spread. Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off. And you could think of things being more off in multiple ways because the system is changing in a way where what happened in the past is no longer a good guide to what\u2019s going to happen in the future.

The sandy Arizona soil cracks under a punishing August sun as red-striped blister beetles search for moisture across its baked surface. Cottonwood trees and sagebrush rise from deep gullies carved by floodwaters that, during the intensifying summer monsoon, sluice off surrounding mesas and wash away fragile topsoil \u2014 reminders that with climate change, even quenching rains harbor powers of destruction.",
            "This portrait of climatic havoc belies a softer reality, though. Farming once thrived in this parched region and could once again \u2014 if the right practices are adopted. Exhibit A: The crops on Roberto Nutlouis\u2019s 12-acre Sliding Rock Farm, in his reservation hometown of Pi\u00f1on, a five-hour drive north of Phoenix. \u201cThe corn is actually pretty big and thriving,\u201d Nutlouis says. He believes \u2014 and both Western science and the lived experience of his Native elders affirm \u2014 that the traditional rock and stick structures he\u2019s built on his property, which help store water and prevent erosion, have a lot to do with it. These structures, similar to those used by Native peoples long before Europeans arrived on the continent, are not only delivering water to crops (the broader, 27,000-square-mile reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S.). They are also restoring Nutlouis\u2019s watershed and those of his neighbors, helping to sequester carbon, and reviving this high-desert ecosystem. It\u2019s all part of a bigger effort among a range of local and regional grassroots organizations to build back the reservation\u2019s fragile, depleted ecosystems and bring greater sovereignty over food, water, and health to its communities.\n",
            "BQPeople living in arid zones have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture water for crops.",
            "Din\u00e9 (the Navajo name for themselves) are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive. Depending on elevation, precipitation in Black Mesa averages 6 to 16 inches a year; recent heat extremes \u2014 the Navajo government declared a state of emergency in 2023 due to soaring temperatures \u2014mean that the scant water evaporates more quickly. Climate models predict the region will experience increasing droughts that decimate plant life, part of a growing trend of human-caused desertification across the globe, as well as higher-intensity seasonal rainfall, which can sweep away crops and roads. The ecological health of the reservation has also been weakened by deforestation from timbering operations and from overgrazing over the years.",
            "Still, this season, Nutlouis, 44, has been able to skip his usual two-hour roundtrip drive to a reliable well to haul water home for his corn. His crop is healthy and hydrated because his land still holds last winter\u2019s snowmelt. Clearly, his heavy labor over the past 20 years \u2014 during which he has built woven brush dams, gabions (wirework cages filled with rocks), earthen berms, concrete spillways and trenches, limestone aprons and walls, and stone-lined \u201cZuni bowls,\u201d which stabilize eroding streambeds \u2014 is paying off.",

Arab peoples and tribes in India have incorporated stone water diversions for thousands of years. \u201c[M]ost traditional Indigenous communities are not passive observers of nature,\u201d writes Lyla June Johnston, a Din\u00e9 anthropologist and community organizer. Instead, they are \u201cinfluential facilitators of landscape scale abundance, rooted in an ethic of kinship and reverence.\u201d",

            "The structures on Nutlouis\u2019s farm are integral cogs in a larger system of floodplain farming. It works like this: Nutlouis\u2019s property lies in an alluvial fan, where mineral-rich sediments and plant waste atop mesas and other uplands wash down onto flatter ground with rainwater, snowmelt, and spring water. Across the valley, similar farms rely on this kind of system, many of which feature stone and stick constructions that Nutlouis helped build. The organic materials trapped behind the structures, says Jonathan Sandor, an emeritus agronomy professor at Iowa State University, \u201care a major input into keeping the fertility of the soils up.\u201d Such small watersheds are optimal: \u201cThese gentle slopes and small watersheds allow runoff but reduce the possibility of high runoff velocities that may damage crops,\u201d Sandor explained in a 2008 paper.",
            "BQ\u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d says an expert.",
            "Whether rock walls or ramps, hand-dug depressions in the soil, earthen walls, or branches plaited into dams, NIDS splash water over a wider area and slow its flow so it can better soak into the soil. Many trap sediments behind them, fertilizing whatever grows nearby. The stone structures create a hyperlocal cooling effect, especially when they\u2019re combined with shade-making vegetation.",
            "Here, too, smallness is a boon. \u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d Norman says. Up to five kilometers downstream from such structures, \u201cwe\u2019ve documented increased vegetation despite drought. We\u2019ve also documented [increased vegetation] up to one kilometer upstream, which indicates water availability.\u201d In this way, an alluvial farm and its NIDS can support plants both sown and wild.\n",
            "\u201cThe moisture we get from winter precipitation is really important for the corn to germinate and grow,\u201d says Nutlouis, \u201cand the monsoon rain is really important to finish our harvest of corn and squash and melons.\u201d He acknowledges that in practice this can look chaotic, with cornfields flooded up to their ears before the water trickles down to the next field.",

            "But lately, climate change has thrown extra challenges at the reservation. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious soil moisture deficit that\u2019s causing a lot of ecological shifts,\u201d Nutlouis says. Much of Black Mesa\u2019s pinyon forest, he says, has succumbed to two decades of drought. Historically, Din\u00e9 have foraged for pinyon pine nuts. They are an important component of food sovereignty on the reservation, and their loss is acutely felt.",
            "But the ecosystem services provided by Nutlouis\u2019s structures on his farm and elsewhere do seem to be meeting those climatic challenges. He\u2019s noticed small juniper trees popping up on hillsides around his property despite the dryness; A cottonwood tree towering over one cornfield is also lush and full. \u201cThe idea that Earth will restore itself with natural seed dispersal\u201d after NIDS begin to do their job \u201chas been my observation,\u201d says Norman. Or as Nutlouis puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re allowing nature to do its own thing and restore itself.\u201d",
            "Still, Nutlouis is inclined to help the process along. His nonprofit Nihikeya (loosely translated as a collective ecological footprint) collaborates with a variety of local and regional grassroots groups that work on food, water, and justice issues, like Tolani Lake Enterprises, First Nations Development Institute, and the Ten Tribes Partnership. Din\u00e9 C.A.R.E., another collaborator, is an environmental justice organization that advocates for community health and land rights across the reservation, as well as for the cleanup of coal- and uranium-polluted rivers and aquifers. \u201cWe especially want to support a lot of renewable projects through solar and wind, and we want to support agriculture too, because having a robust food system is a form of revenue for local farmers,\u201d says executive director Robyn Jackson. \u201cIt also helps with continuing our cultural traditions.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to farming into the future,\u201d says a Navajo activist.",
            "Nihikeya also works closely with the water-rights organization T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed, whose members are collecting native plant seeds to restore riparian habitat across Black Mesa. Some of those native plants, like wolfberry, are edible, which will also help improve food sovereignty and security. \u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to continuing farming into the future,\u201d says T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed executive director Nicole Horseherder.",
            "To house accessions of pinyon and juniper, willow, wolfberry bush, three-leaf sumac, and rabbit brush, Nutlouis is building a seed bank. When put back into the landscape, these plants will help keep the ground moist and mitigate erosion.\n",
            "Nutlouis is working on his master\u2019s degree in sustainable communities at Northern Arizona University, where he studies the Western science that qualifies and quantifies the benefits of traditional practices. But he is also adamant that watershed restoration success is predicated on reforging ancestral kinship connections \u2014 that is, on returning the power to make land-use decisions to clan mothers, who were traditionally Din\u00e9 leaders in this arena. To that end, he\u2019s been meeting with neighbors in one tiny watershed of Burnt Corn Valley after another to discuss how to improve the health of their land, whether for growing corn or just ensuring roads remain intact when it rains. So far, Nutlouis has helped restore 56 fields across the valley, with more NIDS than he can count.",

One of her NIDS study sites saw its water availability extended from three months to four months. \u201cYou can envision how important that is for arid lands,\u201d she says.",

            "*A_Taiwan_Semiconductor_Manufacturing_Company_factory_in_Taipei",
            "Some 50 miles southwest of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, and strategically located close to a cluster of the island\u2019s top universities, the 3,500-acre Hsinchu Science Park is globally celebrated as the incubator of Taiwan\u2019s most successful technology companies. It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. ",
            "Today Taiwan\u2019s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan\u2019s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. ",
            "It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent.\n",
            "BQBy 2030, Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry will consume twice as much electricity as the whole of New Zealand.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s more than 23 million people consume nearly as much energy per capita as U.S. consumers, but the lion\u2019s share of that consumption \u2014 56 percent \u2014 goes to Taiwan\u2019s industrial sector for companies like TSMC. In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan\u2019s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s government is banking on the continuing success of its technology sector and wants the island to be a leader in A.I. But just one small data center, the Vantage 16MW Data center in Taipei, is expected to require as much energy as some 13,000 households. Nicholas Chen, a lawyer who analyses Taiwan\u2019s climate and energy policies, warns that the collision of Taiwan\u2019s commitments to the clean energy transition and its position in global supply chains as a key partner of multinational companies that have made commitments to net-zero deadlines \u2014 along with the explosive growth in demand \u2014 has all the makings of a crisis.\n",
            "\u201cIn order to plan and operate A.I. data centers, an adequate supply of stable, zero-carbon energy is a precondition,\u201d he said. \u201cA.I. data centers cannot exist without sufficient green energy.

            "It is not just a case of building more capacity. Taiwan\u2019s energy dilemma is a combination of national security, climate, and political challenges. The island depends on imported fossil fuel for around 90 percent of its energy and lives under the growing threat of blockade, quarantine, or invasion from China. In addition, for political reasons, the government has pledged to close its nuclear sector by 2025.",
            "Taiwan regularly attends U.N. climate meetings, though never as a participant. Excluded at China\u2019s insistence from membership in the United Nations, Taiwan asserts its presence on the margins, convening side events, and adopting the Paris Agreement targets of peak emissions before 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. Its major companies, TSMC included, have signed up to RE100, a corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged to achieve net zero production. But right now, there is a wide gap between aspiration and performance. ",
            "Angelica Oung, a journalist and founder of the Clean Energy Transition Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for a rapid energy transition, has studied Taiwan\u2019s energy sector for years. When we met in a restaurant in Taipei, she cheerfully ordered an implausibly large number of dishes that crowded onto the small table as we talked. Oung described two major blackouts \u2014 one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge.\n",
            "BQTaiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, leaving it vulnerable to both price fluctuations and blockade by China. ",
            "Nicholas Chen argues that government is failing to keep up even with existing demand. \u201cIn the past eight years there have been four major power outages,\u201d he said, and \u201cbrownouts are commonplace.\u201d ",
            "The operating margin on the grid \u2014 the buffer between supply and demand \u2014 ought to be 25 percent in a secure system. In Taiwan, Oung explained, there have been several occasions this year when the margin was down to 5 percent. \u201cIt shows that the system is fragile,\u201d she said. ",
            "Taiwan\u2019s current energy mix illustrates the scale of the challenge: Last year, Taiwan\u2019s power sector was 83 percent dependent on fossil fuel: Coal accounted for around 42 percent of generation; natural gas 40 percent; and oil 1 percent. Nuclear supplied 6 percent, and solar, wind, hydro, and biomass together, nearly 10 percent, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, which leaves the island at the mercy both of international price fluctuations and potential blockade by China. The government has sought to shield consumers from rising global prices, but that has resulted in growing debt for the Taiwan Electric Power Company (Taipower), the national provider. In the event of a naval blockade by China, Taiwan could count on about six weeks reserves of coal but not much more than a week of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Given that LNG supplies more than a third of electricity generation, the impacts would be severe. \n",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19557263/embed",
            "The government has announced ambitious energy targets. The 2050 net-zero roadmap released by Taiwan\u2019s National Development Council in 2022 promised to shut down its nuclear sector by 2025. By the same year, the share of coal would have to come down to 30 percent, gas would have to rise to 50 percent, and renewables would have to leap to 20 percent. None of those targets is on track. ",
            "Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. \u201cThe problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don\u2019t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.\u201d Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks.",
            "According to Peter Kurz, a consultant to the technology sector and a long-term resident of Taiwan, there is one renewable resource that the nation has in abundance. \u201cThe Taiwan Strait has a huge wind resource,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the most wind power anywhere in the world available close to a population.\u201d",
            "BQGovernment critics regard the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor as needless self-harm.",
            "Offshore wind is under development, but the government is criticized for imposing burdensome requirements to use Taiwanese products and workers that the country is not well equipped to meet. They reflect the government\u2019s ambition to build a native industry at the same time as addressing its energy problem. But critics point out that Taiwan lacks the specialist industrial skills that producing turbines demands, and the requirements lead to higher costs and delays.",
            "Despite the attraction of Taiwan\u2019s west coast with its relatively shallow waters, there are other constraints, such as limited harbor space. There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan\u2019s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters from China\u2019s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable.",
            "Government critics regard one current policy as needless self-harm: the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor by next year and achieve a \u201cnuclear free homeland.\u201d It is a pledge made by the current ruling party, the Democratic People\u2019s Party (DPP) and, as the deadline approaches, it is a policy increasingly being questioned. Taiwan\u2019s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978. The DPP came into existence in 1986, the year of the Chernobyl disaster, and its decision to adopt a no-nuclear policy was reinforced by the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan in 2011.",

            "Of Taiwan\u2019s six nuclear reactors, three are now shut down, two have not been brought online, and the one functioning unit is due to close next year. The shuttered reactors have not yet been decommissioned, possibly because, in addition to its other difficulties, Taiwan has run out of waste storage capacity: The fuel rods remain in place because there is nowhere else to put them. As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change. Voters added to the confusion in 2021 when they opposed the completion of the two uncommissioned plants.",
            "On the 13th floor of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei, the deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s energy administration, Stephen Wu, chose his words carefully. \u201cThere is a debate going on in our parliament,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the public has demanded a reduction of nuclear power and also a reduction in carbon emissions. So there is some discussion about whether the [shuttered] nuclear plants will somehow function again when conditions are ready.\u201d",
            "BQIf Taiwan does not accelerate clean energy deployment, companies will be obliged to leave the island, an analyst warns.",
            "Wu acknowledged that Taiwan was nudging against the limits of its current supply and that new entrants to Taiwan\u2019s science and technology parks have to be carefully screened for their energy needs. But he took an optimistic view of Taiwan\u2019s capacity to sustain A.I. development. \u201cWe assess energy consumption of companies to ensure the development of these companies complies with environmental protection,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Singapore, data centers are highly efficient. We will learn from Singapore.\u201d",
            "Critics of the government\u2019s energy policy are not reassured. Chen has an alarming message: If Taiwan does not radically accelerate its clean energy development, he warns, companies will be obliged to leave the island. They will seek zero-carbon operating environments to comply with the net-zero requirements of partners such as Amazon, Meta, and Google, and to avoid carbon-based trade barriers such as the European Union\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. ",

            "For Kurz, Taiwan\u2019s energy security dilemma requires an imaginative leap. \u201cCables [carrying offshore wind energy] are vulnerable but replaceable,\u201d he says. \u201cCentralized nuclear is vulnerable to other risks, such as earthquakes.\u201d One solution, he believes, lies in small modular nuclear reactors that could even be moored offshore and linked with undersea cables. It is a solution that he believes the Taiwan\u2019s ruling party might come around to.",
            "There is a further security question to add to Taiwan\u2019s complex challenges. The island\u2019s circumstances are unique: It is a functioning democracy, a technological powerhouse, and a de facto independent country that China regards as a breakaway province to be recovered \u2014 if necessary, by force. The fact that its technology industry is essential for global production of everything from electric vehicles to ballistic missiles has counted as a security plus for Taiwan in its increasingly tense stand-off with China. It is not in the interest of China or the United States to see semiconductor manufacturers damaged or destroyed. Such companies, in security jargon, are collectively labelled Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a shield the government is keen to maintain. That the sector depends inescapably on Taiwan\u2019s energy security renders the search for a solution all the more urgent."

The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization\u2019s work in the region.",
            "The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians \u2014 more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them.",
            "The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month \u2014 signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists \u2014 contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not \u201cdetract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d noting their \u201clands include more than one-third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes.\u201d",

            "Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas.

Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",

            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers.

            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas.

They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",

Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geoengineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change.",
            "Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral \u2014 eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",
            "BQGlaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century.",
            "Meanwhile, some of his collaborators, fearing the logistical complications of such a task, are pondering an even more mind-bending idea. They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can\u2019t wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t mitigate our way out of this,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe need other tools.\u201d\n",
            "Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls.\n",
            "Back in 1978, glaciologist John Mercer, of Ohio State University, warned of a \u201cmajor disaster \u2013 a rapid five-meter rise in sea level, caused by deglaciation of West Antarctica\u201d \u2014 should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise. Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "Ice-sheet modeling last year by Kaitlin Naughten of the British Antarctic Survey concurred. \u201cThe opportunity to preserve the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in its present-day state has probably passed,\u201d she concluded, \u201cand policymakers should be prepared for several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.\u201d",
            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",
            "BQSome experts are confident that giant undersea curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean.",
            "Moore wants to get started on testing the idea, and he and his collaborators are seeking research funding. The first experiments in a large lab tank are expected to begin within a few weeks at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Climate Repair, whose mission is to advance \u201cclimate repair projects that can be rolled out at scale within the next 5-10 years.\u201d",
            "Real-world experiments could follow quickly, says Moore. \u201cWithin two years, we could be working at a fjord in northern Norway, testing different designs in a marine setting.\u201d He has identified a target fjord but won\u2019t say where. \u201cIf that goes well, we would want to scale up to a curtain as much as a kilometer across.\u201d He envisions this being tested among the glaciers of Svalbard, the Norwegian Arctic archipelago that has become an international center for polar research. \u201cIn 10-15 years, we should have something to deploy in Antarctica,\u201d he says.",
            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.

The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",
            "Moore calls the bubble barrier a \u201cwild card.\u201d But, he says, \u201cit is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.\u201d Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched.",
            "BQAn Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides.",
            "There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "In an ideal world, Scambos says, \u201cwe could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.\u201d But the world isn\u2019t like that.

We need a social licence.\u201d He agrees that there are other important causes of current and future sea-level rise. But \u201cnone of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.\u201d",

Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

            "Researchers at NREL had been thinking about something like GeoTES for years, but they needed funding and land to make it a reality, which led them to partner with a Kern County-based energy investment firm, Premier Resource Management, in Bakersfield. In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea. By early this year, when California officially announced a ban on new permits for hydraulic fracking, they were fully focused on a way to give the old wells new life \u2014 as a battery, of sorts.\n",
            "BQTo survive a downturn in oil and gas, Kern County aims to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub.",
            "In its heyday in the mid-1980s, Kern County produced 256 million barrels of oil a year, and it remains the seventh-largest oil producing county in the U.S. Despite the industry\u2019s harm \u2014 more people per capita die from chronic lower respiratory disease here than anywhere else in California \u2014 drilling still pumps $13 billion a year into the local economy. Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

            "The geothermal industry would appear to offer a relatively seamless shift for many oilfield workers. Often, contractors can simply apply their skills to hot water instead of oil. As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",
            "Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology for the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council, a global nonprofit that works to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage, cautions that 10-hour energy-storage solutions will help us get through the swing from night to day, but that we produce and consume renewable energy on a scale that spans seasons.\n",
            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",
            "BQThe world will need up to 100,000 tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean doubling mining.",
            "Another driver of the search for new sources of uranium, which is essential to nuclear reactors, is geopolitics. The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts. But based on the industry\u2019s track record of polluting air, water, and soil with both radioactivity and heavy metals, and its obfuscation of mining\u2019s environmental threats, many observers \u2014 especially Indigenous people, who have borne the brunt of past uranium mining and who still suffer health problems linked with unremediated mining sites \u2014 remain skeptical.\n",
            "Exploration continues nonetheless. \u201cEveryone is convinced there is going to be a much larger demand for uranium going forward,\u201d said Matthew L.

            "If small modular reactors \u2014 units that can produce up to 300 megawatts of energy \u2014 prove efficient and economical, Wald says, they could be mass produced quickly and further increase the demand for uranium. There are plans for several small modular reactors, which have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, currently underway in the U.S. and Canada. \n",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world will need up to 100,000 metric tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean nearly doubling mining from current levels. And so companies around the globe are both looking for new deposits and reopening old mines. In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",

            "Greenland, meanwhile, is going against this trend. Concerned with the possible health impacts of mining, the Indigenous Inuit government in 2021 banned prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of uranium. And in 2023 it denied a permit for an Australian company to mine a massive deposit of rare earth metals called Kvanefjeld because bringing them to the surface would also convey uranium, with which it is commingled. ",

Historically, the industry has polluted groundwater, surface water, and soil around the world with radioactive waste and dust, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage.

            "But supporters of uranium mining say that new methods and technologies are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past and have far smaller footprints. That\u2019s because most new mines now use in-situ leaching, in which ore is left in the ground and miners recover the earth\u2019s minerals by dissolving them with hydrogen peroxide or an acid or alkaline leach.

The Obama administration proposed tighter standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by in-situ uranium mining, with a focus on groundwater protection and restoration, but the Trump administration rolled those regulations back. According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this.

The conflagration killed 1.3 million Joshua trees, including most of those on Cima Dome, one of the largest and densest Joshua tree woodlands in the world.\n",
            "Then in 2023, the York Fire swept through and burned a large section of adjacent Joshua tree forest, killing another million or so trees. The destruction on Cima Dome \u2014 which is higher in elevation and cooler than the surrounding desert \u2014 came as an especially severe blow to the National Park Service and conservationists who had considered it a stronghold for the eastern Joshua tree and a key to the species\u2019 future.\n",

Precipitation in the Mojave, the most arid place in North America, varies widely but averages 5 inches a year.

            "At the same time, wet years also help plant species that threaten the Joshua tree. \u201cOver the last few decades, the invasive grasses originally brought here by cattle ranching and other sources have taken over the Mojave, [changing] the fire regime,\u201d said Cummings. Grasses such as red brome and Mediterranean split grass are highly flammable, and in wet years they grow in profusion and create more intense and far more widespread fires.",
            "There is also concern that the invasion of exotic species, in combination with climate change and the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen \u2014 which wafts in from the smoggy Los Angeles basin and stimulates the growth of flammable grasses \u2014 will keep the post-fire Joshua woodlands from reestablishing themselves. Instead, those areas could convert to a non-native grassland with low biodiversity.",

The federal government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, rejected federal endangered species protection for both subspecies, most recently in 2023.",
            "One reason for the lack of protection is that there is currently no shortage of Joshua trees \u2014 the threat is based on projections of future loss.

Nonetheless, Cummings argues that they are both deserving of protection because the forecasts of the future look bleak. \u201cWe know they are on an extinction trajectory, given the threat of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf climate change is frozen at current levels, we [still] lose half their range.\u201d Temperatures, of course, are not expected to remain steady.",

Ironically, one of the biggest threats to trees are large-scale solar arrays that are being built to help wean the state off fossil fuels.

In Joshua Tree National Park, managers are clearing grasses in refugia, for example, to remove fuel and create fire breaks between trees.",

But \u201cyou can\u2019t just move the Joshua tree,\u201d Kaiser, from California\u2019s Department of Fish and Wildlife, said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to move the nurse plants [which help seedlings get established]. You\u2019ve got to move the yucca moth pollinator. You\u2019ve got to monitor. All of the research we\u2019ve seen so far suggests it\u2019s not a viable option at this moment in time. But we\u2019re not ruling it out.\u201d\n",
            "In spite of all these threats, there are glimmers of hope. Increased use of electric vehicles in Southern California, for example, could reduce levels of the atmospheric nitrogen that fuels the growth of flammable grasses.",

So Joshua trees as a species are not going to go extinct, but areas of the Mojave Desert will become more ecologically depauperate if they lose the Joshua tree \u2014 unless we can reverse the climate change issue.\u201d "

The tiny, transparent, larvae are then carried on the current to Europe\u2019s Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs.

To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980.

Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle.

She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",

In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed.

In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",

Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years.

This one male had something strange in his nose. We thought at first it might be a barnacle or a tube worm. But when we started pulling it out and snipped off a little piece, it became clear that it was plastic straw.",

            "Figgener: We have seen baby turtles getting stuck in water bottles. We saw a female who got lodged in a car tire and drowned. We\u2019ve seen all kinds of entanglements in plastic bags and sacks. We saw a sea turtle that had dragged an entire fishing rod onto the beach.\n",
            "Once, I watched this female leatherback turtle on our beach trying to lay her eggs. She was pressing and pressing and nothing came. Eventually I felt with my hands in her cloaca, and there was something funny in there. I tugged on it, and it came out, a plastic trash bag. She had ingested it, and she was lucky enough that it went through the entire intestinal tract. After I removed the bag, she was finally able to lay her eggs.\n",

            "Figgener: Plastic bags do look a lot like jellyfish. In addition to that, the longer plastic floats through the ocean, the more of a biofilm forms on its surface, and there is increasing scientific data that it smells like food to the turtles. ",
            "e360: Aren\u2019t fishing nets also a threat?",
            "Figgener: Absolutely, industrial fishing is a major threat. We\u2019re losing, conservatively, hundreds of thousands of sea turtles as incidental bycatch in fishing nets every year. We also have the problem of so-called ghost nets, nets that were lost or dumped and abandoned. Once a turtle gets entangled in a ghost net, they drag this big weight behind them. In some cases, they are not able to move at all. It also leads to many nasty cuts, amputations, and limb loss in sea turtles. Even a single fishing line wrapped around a flipper can cut off blood flow.",

            "Figgener: Petroleum gets into the ocean through spills and other ways. Fertilizers and pesticides wash into rivers and end up in the oceans. In green turtles there is a type of cancer called fibropapillomatosis, which creates cauliflower-shaped tumors on soft tissue, like the eyes and the skin, and is basically triggered by fertilizer runoff. This runoff also creates dead zones in the ocean and toxic red tides where the turtles will feed on the algae blooms and eventually die.",

Our world, our oceans are much too complex to say that if we just stop eating fish or using plastic straws or what have you, sea turtles will be safe.",
            "e360: We\u2019ve been talking about the problems. But you also write about an amazing success story. The Kemp ridley sea turtle was brought back from the brink of extinction. How did that happen?",
            "Figgener: A lot of things came together in the favor of the Kemp ridleys. Back in the late 70s and 80s there were only a few hundred nesting females left in the Gulf of Mexico. These turtles often ended up in the nets of shrimp trawlers. In response, the U.S. mandated a turtle excluding device attached to the nets which reduced bycatch by about 90 percent.",

            "Some eggs were transported from Mexico to Texas where [a nesting colony was re-established at Padre Island National Seashore.] And there was a \u201chead start program\u201d in the U.S. in which eggs were incubated in a controlled environment and then grown until they were the size of a plate and no longer so vulnerable to predation as tiny baby sea turtles are when they are born. These turtles were then released into the Gulf.",

If we know enough about the ecology of the species, where they feed, where they mate and so on, it could happen. We can come up with successful strategies to save them.

I don\u2019t think people understand the kind of obstacles people like her face. The public schools in rural Costa Rica are not very good.

We always have students from outside Costa Rica, and tourists. I think that passion that makes people travel all that way to see a nesting sea turtle definitely changes something in the mindset of the people who live here. It also shows them that you can earn more money with a live turtle than by eating the meat or selling the eggs.\n",

            "Investigative journalism can be a very deep dive. By the end of his probe into the supply chain of JBS, the world\u2019s largest meat processing and packing company, Marcel Gomes reckons he and his team at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based nonprofit Rep\u00f3rter Brasil knew more about the origins of the beef it supplies from the Amazon to the world\u2019s hamburger chains and supermarkets than the company itself. ",
            "With grassroots support from labor unions and Indigenous communities, he had mapped the complex networks of cattle farms responsible for illegal deforestation. He then tracked the often-illicit beef through JBS\u2019s slaughterhouses and packing plants to the freezers, shelves, and customer trays of retail outlets and fast-food restaurants around the world. When his sleuths were done, the fingerprints of forest destruction were plain to see. Six of Europe\u2019s biggest retail chains reacted by halting purchases of JBS beef. \n",
            "That investigation just won Gomes, 45, a Goldman Environment Prize. But sadly, he says in an interview with Yale Environment 360, when he went to San Francisco last month to pick up the prize, stores there still had tainted beef on their shelves. \n",

            "Yale Environment 360: Why did you choose to investigate JBS?\n",
            "Marcel Gomes: Well, Brazil is the world\u2019s biggest beef exporter. My country has more than 200 million cattle, and ranching is the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, where more than 40 percent of the cattle are raised. JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company. It exports leather \u2014 for instance to Germany, where it makes car seats \u2014 and biodiesel made from beef tallow. ",
            "e360: Can you describe how you tracked its supply chain?\n",
            "Gomes: Since 2011, Brazil has had legislation intended to improve the transparency of sources of supply of beef and other agricultural commodities. So, at Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which was founded in 2008, we began to collect this public data on everything related to environmental, social, and labor issues. We started to cross-check the data so we could trace supply chains right from the ranch to consumers.",
            "Then we put this information together with data on areas where ranchers had been fined for environmental violations such as deforestation, and where there were reports of modern slavery and forced or child labor. We also used satellite images to identify which farms had seen deforestation each year, and we tapped into data on the transport of cattle from those farms to the slaughterhouses receiving the cattle.",

            "fCA cattle farm in the Amazon.\nFernando Martinho",
            "The second part of our investigations has been the consumer market. JBS sells around the world. So, in 2021, we hired researchers in Europe and the U.S., as well as Brazil, to visit stores to find Brazilian beef and take pictures of the seals and export tracking numbers. Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from. For us it was very important to go to the supermarkets and take pictures, and to have that clear evidence.",
            "Then we connected both ends of the supply chain, and called everybody \u2014 the supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, the traders, JBS, the public health authorities, everyone \u2014 to tell them what we had found and ask for them to respond. Several supermarket chains in Europe believed our findings straight away and announced boycotts just as our report was published. They included Sainsbury\u2019s in the U.K., Carrefour in Belgium, and Auchan in France. Later, others joined them.\n",
            "e360: How important is your grassroots work with labor unions and Indigenous people?\n",
            "Gomes: Very important. They guide us in the field to identify the ranches, and sometimes protect us from violence. They know the routes the trucks take, the names of people we can interview, and the workers who can tell inspectors about slavery. Indigenous communities especially know about the environmental impact they are suffering from the deforestation.",
            "BQ\u201cWe need to change the system in Brazil, to find a new way to trace the cattle moving between farms and to stop cattle laundering.\u201d",
            "e360: You talk about cattle laundering \u2014 raising cattle on recently deforested land, and then moving the animals to graze somewhere else for a short while to create the impression of a supply chain that doesn\u2019t involve deforestation. Is that a big issue?",
            "Gomes: Yes. It is common to move cattle from farm to farm in Brazil, often three or four times. There can be legitimate reasons for doing this, because cattle raising is quite a specialized business. But it can also cover up a \u201cdirty\u201d trail.",
            "In theory there are rules to prevent the trading of cattle from illegal to legal areas. But in practice it is very easy to do, especially when you have several members of a family doing the same business. One brother can move cattle to the land of another brother, with no paperwork. Also, you can change the boundaries of your own land, for instance, by turning one ranch into two, one clean and the other dirty. Then you can just trade with companies like JBS from the clean part. \n",
            "That \u201claundering\u201d works because JBS and most of the other meat processors only keep a record of their direct supplier, the last step in the chain. So a lot of what happens before that is hidden.",

            "e360: I wonder why not. Is cattle laundering something that the companies have encouraged, or do they turn a blind eye, or maybe it is ignorance that happened almost by accident?",
            "Gomes: Well, I don\u2019t know. But if, in the future, companies [such as JBS] decide to eliminate the dirty part of their supply chain, they will lose a big market share. So there are business reasons not to monitor the whole supply chain. We need to change the system in Brazil, to find a new way to trace the cattle moving between farms and to stop cattle laundering. Without that, we won\u2019t have JBS and other companies operating in a sustainable way.\n",
            "e360: Did JBS ever try to prevent your findings from being published?\n",
            "Gomes: They have in the past. But in the last few years they have been more responsive, as the media and NGOs have used the information we have gathered to pressure them. We have a dialogue now. We send them the result of our investigations, and they provide us with information. They have also started to remove ranches from their supply chain.",

We do find that, under Lula, farmers are abiding by the laws more, however. Deforestation rates in the Amazon have decreased in the last year and a half, since Lula returned to power. But we still have a big problem in the cerrado, the big savanna region to the south and east [of the Amazon]. You can still legally clear 80 percent of the trees on your land there. That needs to change.",

            "Of course, if they exclude all suppliers with environmental nonconformities they are going to lose a lot of them. So it will take time to reshape their business, and I cannot see a big change yet.",

            "Cattle came out badly. We found that of the 55,000 workers who had been released by government inspectors from slave conditions since 1995, about a third were in the cattle industry. Most of the people involved in deforestation for cattle are enslaved people.\n",

For instance, we have looked at the labor practices of orange growers supplying juice to soft-drinks companies such as Coca-Cola, who sell on to McDonald\u2019s among many others.\n",
            "Late last year we published a report about Starbucks, showing that some of its coffee suppliers were responsible for serious human rights abuses. That contradicted the company\u2019s claim to have 100 percent ethical sourcing. The report is now being used in a lawsuit against Starbucks in the U.S. Starbucks is now engaging over that, which is nice.",

That they cradle within their currents a swirling distillation of every incident and anecdote that has transpired in the inhabited landscapes they course through. And few rivers carry a headier and more sobering brew of history \u2014 tales of human woe and triumph \u2014 than the Tigris and Euphrates, the fabled waterways that pour through the heartlands of Eurasian civilization, through the Fertile Crescent, from their chilly headwaters in the mountains of Turkey through vast watersheds in Syria, Kuwait, and Iran, to finally empty into Persian Gulf at the sweltering marshland shores of Iraq.",

A local shepherd named \u00c7oban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf, once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels \u2014 a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory \u2014 were soon to be erased.",

The two life-giving rivers that long sustained the region\u2019s varied cultures are being throttled.",

            "About 20 million students in the United States ride to school each day on the familiar yellow bus. The vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 490,000 school buses \u2014 which comprise the nation\u2019s largest public-transportation fleet \u2014 are powered by diesel engines. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning our kids on the way to school,\u201d said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children\u2019s lungs.",
            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",

            "fCChildren aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February.\nTom Brenner / AP Photo.",
            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19371586/embed",
            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

            "With a plan for green infrastructure to drain some 9,500 acres across the city, the Philadelphia Water Department was considered by many to be at the cutting edge of stormwater management \u2014 an increasingly urgent challenge for city governments amid the bigger, more frequent rainstorms now occurring as a result of climate change, especially in the northeastern United States.\n",
            "The program led Philadelphia and other U.S. cities to install nature-based solutions to absorb and filter rainfall alongside traditional \u201cgray infrastructure,\u201d such as pipes, tunnels, and pump stations. Yet while other cities, such as Milwaukee and Boston, saw green measures as complements to gray infrastructure, Philadelphia placed rain gardens and bioswales \u2014 vegetated ditches that collect stormwater \u2014 at the center of its strategy. But now, critics say, these innovations are proving inadequate at handling the increase in extreme rainfall events. In fact, the amount of overflow from pipes that combine stormwater with raw sewage has actually increased since the Green Cities program began.\n",

But its storage tunnels and tanks have done the most to reduce combined sewer overflows into Lake Michigan and local rivers, said Kevin Shafer, the district\u2019s executive director. He estimated that the system\u2019s gray infrastructure can currently handle two and a half to three inches of rain at a time, while green measures can absorb only about half an inch.",
            "Still, he calls green infrastructure \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d because managing water where it falls protects water bodies from contaminants like bacteria, heavy metals, and trash, and it reduces the risk of basement backups. \u201cYou have to have both,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Despite its limited finances and aging infrastructure, Milwaukee\u2019s sewerage district has set a goal of eliminating combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2035. \u201cWith the changing climate we\u2019re facing,\u201d Shafer has said, \u201cit\u2019s like running uphill, and the hill keeps getting steeper and steeper.\u201d\n",

The city is operating under a long-term control plan \u2014 a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be \u201cfishable and swimmable.\u201d To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",

In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan.",
            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn\u2019t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.\u201d\n",
            "In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050\u2019s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That\u2019s above the watershed\u2019s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet.\n",

When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",

            "When marine biologist Richard Thompson and his students analyzed samples of beach sand over 20 years ago, they were surprised to find countless small multicolored pieces of plastic mixed in. Thompson, a professor at the University of Plymouth, dubbed the fragments \u201cmicroplastics\u201d and published the first-ever paper on the subject in Science magazine in 2004.\n",
            "Since that landmark study, more than 7,000 papers have come out about microplastics, including one coauthored by Thompson that was published in Science last month and warned that the tiny particles pose a growing biological threat to many species, including humans. The rate of global plastic production has roughly doubled in the last two decades. Without action at a global level, Thompson has written, plastic production could triple by 2060.",

            "Richard Thompson: I was conducting experiments on the shore that were accumulating lots of little pieces of plastic. I mobilized the students, and we organized beach cleans. I started asking the question, \u201cWhat are the smallest pieces?\u201d My students went out on the beach, and they brought back samples of sand. When we looked at them with a microscope, we saw pieces that didn\u2019t look like sand, that turned out to be plastic. We discovered that microplastics, including many smaller than the diameter of a human hair, contaminated waters around the U.K.",
            "In a 2004 paper published in Science, we showed that they were biologically available to a range of marine organisms. We also showed, using archived samples, that the abundance of these small fragments, which we named microplastics, had increased significantly since the 1960s. ",
            "e360: We\u2019ve known about plastic pollution for a long time. Why did it take so long for scientists to look into this question of microplastics?",
            "Thompson: There were some studies of plastic pollution in the 1960s and 70s. But nobody was recording small bits. And it wasn\u2019t until our 2004 paper that this really started to attract attention. I suppose it was kind of out of sight, out of mind, particularly for what I was describing, which was truly microscopic. You wouldn\u2019t have been able to see it without a microscope.\n",
            "e360: Did you immediately sense how important a discovery was?\n",
            "Thompson: Probably not. I mean, I thought it was important enough to submit to Science. When I got back from holiday [after the paper was published,] my computer was full of media inquiries. Almost nothing else that morning. The phone was ringing constantly.",

            "Since then, we\u2019ve looked from Mount Everest down to the deep sea, from the poles to the equator. We\u2019ve found this material everywhere. I recently came back from a major scientific conference [MICRO 2024 in Lanzarote, Spain] just about microplastics. I would never have dreamt of that 20 years ago. There were 700 scientists from all around the world registered at the conference just to discuss microplastics. So interest has grown phenomenally.",

            "Thompson: The [microplastics] problem is going to be irreversible. And the predictions are that we\u2019ll see wide-scale ecological harm from microplastics in the next 70 to 100 years. We\u2019ve already got clear evidence of ecological harm. They\u2019re not going to degrade, they\u2019re persistent contaminants. And because of their small size, it\u2019s going to be kind of irreversible. So I don\u2019t know, have the public got that level of concern right or wrong?\n",

I\u2019d argue that maybe tackling the problem of plastic pollution, although incredibly complex is, I\u2019m hesitant to say, simpler. I would argue that a lot of the societal benefits that we get from plastics could be realized without the harm by starting to use plastics more sustainably. We\u2019ve failed to design plastics [for recycling and reuse] for example. So that\u2019s part of the problem with producing colossal quantities, well over 400 million tons of plastic every year, 40 percent of it is destined for single use.",

            "Thompson: The biggest source overall accounting for about two-thirds of all microplastics is the larger items of litter that are accumulating in the environment. The packets, the bottles, all of those things will fragment over time into smaller and smaller pieces. There are also fragments and fibers that wear away from larger items like car tires and clothing. The other third is direct emissions of small pieces to the environment. For example, the small bits of plastic that are intentionally added to products such as cosmetics and paints.",

And there\u2019s clear evidence of harm to individuals. There are also experiments that demonstrate effects on communities and also on ecosystem services, things like gas exchange between sediment and seawater.

There\u2019s evidence of transfer along food chain, but there isn\u2019t biomagnifcation as we see with mercury, for example, from the best evidence that we\u2019ve got at the moment. Now, where I think we may see a change to that is as we start to work on smaller and smaller particles.",

The gut handles foreign material from time to time. It\u2019s a barrier in its own right. But once we\u2019re inside the circulatory system in organisms, then I\u2019d say the potential is quite different. So I think small is certainly more biologically available.",

Back in 2004 when I published that first paper, I entitled it \u201cLost At Sea: Where Is All The Plastic?\u201d Because what I did not see at that time in any of the data that was coming from beach cleans was the increase in abundance that you might expect to see. And neither did I see it from surface trawl data. But the reason I believe is that we weren\u2019t yet recording the small bits, so we were missing a fraction. And also there are sinks, places of accumulation that we\u2019re not yet looking at. The deep sea looks like it\u2019s got a lot in it, but we don\u2019t have all that much data from it.",
            "e360: So potentially, just like we have the Pacific garbage patch, there could also be places where these microplastics are accumulating in the ocean?",
            "Thompson: Yes, that\u2019s right. There are surface gyres, but I think the deep sea is also really quite a big sink. We\u2019ve got some data there to illustrate quite high concentrations, indeed concentrations higher than in sediments close to some cities. The deep sea is downhill from everywhere, if you like.",

When three similar items of clothing were tested, we got up to an 80 percent difference in the rate of release.

Do we have the science budgets to spend billions further drilling down into human health? Have we got two decades to pursue that? I mean, we don\u2019t know when the strongest evidence around human health might emerge. It could be tomorrow. It could be 20 years. It might cost billions. We can\u2019t wait for all these studies to the done before we take action.

Recycling rates globally are less than 10 percent. If product design and waste management had gotten together decades ago, we would be in a stronger place now. We\u2019re also going to need transparency of labeling to ensure that chemicals of concern are listed. And we need to simplify [the composition of] chemicals in plastics to make them safer and to make them of more circular [reusable] materials.",

            "It\u2019s very different to the discussions that we had with industry over tobacco smoking, for example, where it was clear there was no safe way to smoke. Nobody\u2019s saying there\u2019s no safe way to use plastics. It\u2019s just that we need to start making them to be safer and more sustainable than we have done so far. And that\u2019s what the treaty needs to help us do. And it\u2019s a frustration to me. We could be in a much stronger place if industry had maybe embraced that voluntarily a bit earlier.\n",

And that\u2019s understandable because like anything, there\u2019s going to be winners and losers, so people are going to disagree. Since, the primary carbon source for plastics is petroleum, the major fossil oil and gas producers also see a concern for them. And, of course, some countries might want to strike some things out of the treaty that could be in my view be really important. So we\u2019re going to have to hope that this lands in the right place. So far, it\u2019s been frustrating to see the lack of consensus among nations about how to address this global problem.\n",
            "e360: What can we do as individuals?\n",
            "Thompson: Of course, you can try to refuse single-use items. You can try to take a reusable bag with you. You can try to take a refillable coffee cup. You can do what you can to make plastic items last and use them as long as possible.",
            "Beyond that, we\u2019re really going to need better design. I mean, if we look to a supermarket of the future, say in 10 years\u2019 time, I would hope that the major brands, producers, and retailers deliver their products in packaging that is compatible with the local waste management system. We need to create clothing that sheds less particles, fishing gear and agricultural plastics that are safer. That\u2019s where the real responsibility lies. It\u2019s not about consumers having to agonize over minute labels on products that have been poorly designed. I\u2019d like that responsibility to be lifted from the consumer.",

On the national level, I\u2019m trying to go to states that have communities that look like mine to connect these issues so that people know these are not one-offs. Cancer Alley in Louisiana is not the only Cancer Alley in the United States. Other communities that look like mine are overrun with polluted air, polluted water. Flint, Michigan\u2019s water crisis is also happening in Sulphur, Louisiana. There\u2019s a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi. We need to start talking about how these issues are connected, how the people in these communities all look alike, and why they\u2019ve been sacrificed for so long.\n",

            "Ozane: Every morning when I wake up, I see my children, and they have this happiness, these smiles. And let me tell you, my children are not hidden from this. If you look back at our Climate Week post, you\u2019ll see my children on the frontlines holding banners. But the fact that they still get up every day smiling, laughing, knowing the fight ahead, it gives me hope. Because I know that if I don\u2019t live to see any of what I\u2019m fighting for come to fruition, I am raising the next generation of environmental activists, of climate activists, and the fight will continue until we win.\n",
