            "Since a schizophrenia drug, the first in decades with an innovative mechanism of action, gained US regulatory approval in September, some researchers have proclaimed a new era for psychiatric medicine. About half a dozen similar drugs \u2014 for schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other conditions involving the brain \u2014 are in various stages of development, most in early-stage clinical trials. But the success of these medicines is not a given. Last week, a trial of a highly anticipated schizophrenia drug reported disappointing results.",
            "For decades, schizophrenia drugs worked in essentially the same way. They blunted the activity of dopamine, a chemical involved in the disorder\u2019s hallmark symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. The new kid on the block is KarXT, sold as Cobenfy. It targets muscarinic receptors and leads to antipsychotic and cognitive benefits. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this much buzz and excitement over a new approach in psychiatry in my career,\u201d says Jeffrey Conn, a pharmacologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, who was one of the company\u2019s scientific co-founders.",
            "KarXT\u2019s success in winning US regulatory approval has revived interest in muscarinic drugs. \u201cDrug discovery is coming back to psychiatry,\u201d says Arthur Christopoulos, a molecular pharmacologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who was involved in the development of KarXT.",
            "But developing new medicines is a hard, long road. On 11 November, Abbvie, a pharmaceutical company in North Chicago, Illinois, announced that its muscarinic drug for schizophrenia, called emraclidine, had failed to outperform a placebo. What this means for other muscarinic drugs in development remains to be seen, Christopoulos says. \u201cIt is still early days.\u201d",
            "h2New psychiatric drugs",
            "KarXT\u2019s road to development wasn\u2019t smooth, either. Xanomeline, one of the active components of the drug, was developed in the 1990s and shown to reduce psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But, in a clinical trial1, many participants who received the drug stopped taking it owing to nausea, vomiting and other side effects. Muscarinic receptors are present throughout the brain and body so drugs that target them can have broad effects. The drug was shelved, along with others under development at the time. \u201cAlmost everyone decided that muscarinic agonists were probably an impossible feat to accomplish,\u201d says Conn.",
            "In 2009, Karuna Therapeutics, based in Boston, Massachusetts, combined xanomeline with another compound, trospium, which blocks muscarinic receptors but cannot cross into the brain, preventing unwanted side effects in the body. The combination became known as KarXT. In clinical trials, people with schizophrenia taking the combined drug experienced antipsychotic and cognitive benefits, with milder side effects than for xanomeline on its own.",
            "h2Mode of action",
            "Xanomeline acts mostly on two of the five muscarinic receptors: the M1 and M4 receptors. Animal studies suggest that the M4 receptor is most strongly associated with antipsychotic effects, whereas the M1 receptor is linked to cognition.",
            "Many of the schizophrenia drugs under investigation are aimed at just one of those receptors \u2014 a strategy that researchers hope will lead to bigger benefits with fewer side effects, says Andrew Tobin, a neuroscientist at the University of Glasgow, UK. (Tobin is the co-founder and chief executive of Keltic Pharma Therapeutics, a Dublin-based company that is working on developing muscarinic drugs.)",
            "Because of similarities in the binding sites of all five muscarinic receptors, selectively targeting one type is a challenge, Tobin says. To get around this, researchers are investigating \u2018allosteric modulators\u2019 of muscarinic receptors, which act on their targets through regions outside the binding site that are more distinct than the sites of the five muscarinic receptors.",
            "Emraclidine, an allosteric modulator targeting the M4 receptor, was one of the muscarinic drugs furthest along the development pipeline. But its failure in the Abbvie phase II trial raises questions, such as whether drugs need to target both the M1 and M4 receptors as KarXT does, says Brian Dean, a biochemist at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Parkville, Australia.",
            "h2Alzheimer\u2019s, addiction and beyond",
            "Pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) in Princeton, New Jersey, which acquired Karuna in March, is running a trial in people to test whether KarXT can also help to treat psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as well as investigating whether the drug might benefit people with bipolar disorder.",
            "Given the role of M1 receptors in cognition, researchers are also designing drugs that target that receptor to reduce cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Tobin says researchers are hopeful that muscarinic drugs might also slow its progression. In 2016, he and his colleagues reported that an M1-specific drug slowed neurodegeneration in mice with a disease resembling Alzheimer\u2019s in humans2.",
            "Muscarinic receptors are found in the reward circuits in the brain, and studies have shown that blocking these pathways can protect animals from becoming addicted to opioids. The receptors are also involved in movement, leading some scientists to examine whether blocking them might help people with Parkinson\u2019s disease3.",
            "h2Real-world test",
            "Although excitement swirls around KarXT, how it fares in the real world remains to be seen. During the clinical trials, participants remained in hospital, where there were few opportunities for environmental influences to affect treatment, says Carol Tamminga, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. (Tamminga is a scientific adviser for Karuna and was involved in the clinical trials of KarXT).",
            "Last month, BMS released data from two, year-long follow-up studies on KarXT treatment in people with schizophrenia who were treated as outpatients. Although they continued to improve over that time, 11\u201318% of the participants stopped taking the drug because of side effects. Ceasing to take a drug is a problem with other available schizophrenia therapeutics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to learn about these drugs,\u201d Tamminga says. ",

            "In a children\u2019s hospital in Vancouver, Canada, a teenager is in critical condition after being infected with an avian influenza virus that has researchers on high alert.",
            "Viral genome sequences released last week suggest that the teenager is infected with an H5N1 avian influenza virus bearing mutations that might improve its ability to infect the human airway. If true, it could mean that the virus can rapidly evolve to make the jump from birds to humans.",
            "It\u2019s a worrying development but it doesn\u2019t mean that a new pandemic is imminent, says immunologist Scott Hensley at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. At present, there is no sign that the virus \u2014 which is related but not identical to the H5N1 virus infecting US dairy cattle \u2014 has been transmitted from the sick adolescent to other people.",
            "\u201cThere is reason to be concerned,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not reason to totally freak out.\u201d",
            "h2How did the teenager get infected?",
            "That is unclear. The adolescent did not work or live on a poultry farm, and researchers have found no signs of H5N1 infection in household pets, said Bonnie Henry, a public health officer for the province of British Columbia in Victoria, Canada, during a press conference. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we may not ever determine the source,\u201d Henry said.",
            "h2Why is this virus so concerning?",
            "The sequencing data suggest that the teenager is infected with a mixture of viruses, all of which are similar to a lineage of H5N1 viruses that is currently infecting poultry and waterfowl in the region. But researchers have homed in on three key differences between those viruses and the teenager\u2019s: two possible mutations that could enhance the virus\u2019s ability to infect human cells, and another that could allow it to replicate more easily in human cells, not just in the cells of its usual avian host.",
            "Could bird flu in cows lead to a human outbreak? Slow response worries scientists",
            "One interpretation of the sequencing data is that some of the viruses infecting the teenager contain the new mutations, and some do not. Such a result could also indicate an error in the sequencing process, but the rest of the sequences look clean and this particular constellation of mutations is unlikely to occur by chance, says Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. \u201cIt pops out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt suggests that there is some evolution going on in this virus right at these important positions.\u201d",
            "Furthermore, the teenager initially had an eye infection, which later developed into a severe lung infection. This could suggest that the virus became better able to enter airway cells after it had infected the adolescent. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with the idea that the virus might have evolved within that individual,\u201d says Hensley.",
            "That could be good news of a sort: it implies that the mutated form of the virus was not the form that originally infected the teenager, and therefore that it might not be circulating widely.",
            "h2Are we on the cusp of another pandemic?",
            "Public-health authorities in Canada have tested about three-dozen close contacts of the infected teenager, none of whom seem to have had H5N1 infections. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that there is any indication that this individual transmitted this virus on to others,\u201d says Bloom.",
            "And just because a virus has evolved to better infect and replicate in human cells, that does not mean that it has also gained the ability to spread to other people, says Hensley. \u201cBeing able to bind to human cell is a prerequisite to cause a pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s often not sufficient.\u201d",
            "Even so, governments and researchers have been preparing in case H5N1 does become transmissible between people. Scientists are developing and testing vaccines against the currently circulating H5N1 viruses, and research1 has shown that stockpiles of H5N1 vaccines designed in the mid-2000s might still be effective against more recent H5N1 viruses. Hensley says that these vaccines are also likely to be effective against viruses such as those found in the teenager.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not the time to panic,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this should serve as a warning: this virus has the capacity to switch very quickly into a form that can cause severe disease.\u201d",
            "h2What do we know about H5N1 infections in people?",
            "There have been 53 confirmed H5N1 infections in humans in the United States this year. Most of these have been linked to a viral strain that can infect cattle and has swept through dairy herds around the country \u2014 and has also caused illness in some of the farm workers who tend the animals.",
            "Flu causes huge spike in child hospitalizations in Canada",
            "Public-health officials are concerned that these viruses might become more adept at infecting human hosts, especially during the human flu season. This could give H5N1 viruses the opportunity to swap genetic material with human flu strains, picking up the ability to infect humans and transmit between people, Henry said. For now, however, such infections have typically been mild, often causing eye infections called conjunctivitis or pink eye, and mild respiratory symptoms.",
            "Globally, there have been around 900 cases of H5N1 infection in people since 1997, Henry said. In almost all of these cases, people were found to have had direct contact with sick animals.",
            "Infection seems to hit young people particularly hard, potentially because their immune systems have not been bolstered by as many years of exposure to other flu strains and vaccines as those of adults have been. The teenager in Canada, who remains in stable but critical condition, developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, a condition in which the lungs become so damaged that they can no longer supply enough oxygen to the body.",
            "\u201cIn young people, this is a virus that can progress and cause quite severe illness,\u201d Henry said. \u201cThis was a healthy teenager prior to this.\u201d",

In a trial, the approach reduced participants\u2019 susceptibility to malaria, potentially paving the way for more effective ways to stop the disease, which infects some 250 million people a year.",
            "\u201cThese findings represent a significant step forward in malaria vaccine development,\u201d says Julius Hafalla, an immunologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \u201cThe ongoing global malaria burden makes the development of more effective vaccines a critical priority.\u201d",
            "The study, which was published1 in The New England Journal of Medicine on 20 November, exposed participants to bites from mosquitoes that had a modified version of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which causes malaria. In humans, the parasites travel to the liver and then infect red blood cells. The parasites were engineered to stop developing shortly after delivery into a human. Nearly 90% of participants exposed to the modified parasites avoided contracting the disease after being bitten by malaria mosquitoes.",
            "There are two approved malaria vaccines. Both aim to provide long-term immunity by producing antibodies that block malaria parasites from infecting liver cells, as well as targeting breakthrough infections.",
            "But the vaccines are only about 75% effective, and require booster shots. So immunologists are continuing to explore alternative strategies.",
            "One approach is using genetically modified parasites. The research team had previously trialled the effectiveness of a modified malaria parasite, called GA1, that is designed to stop developing about 24 hours after infection in humans2. But the GA1 parasite protected only a few participants against malaria, leading the team to engineer a second parasite, GA2. GA2 is designed to stop developing about six days post-infection, during the crucial period where the parasites replicate in human liver cells.",
            "The researchers tested whether exposure to GA1 or GA2 could help humans develop immunity to malaria. They exposed participants to bites from 50 mosquitoes; 10 participants received bites from mosquitoes infected with GA1 parasites, and 10 were bitten by those with GA2 parasites. Three weeks later, they exposed participants to malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Just before exposure to these mosquitoes, both sets of participants had higher levels of antibodies than before. One of eight (13%) participants bitten by GA1 parasites didn\u2019t contract malaria compared with 89% in the GA2 group. Other than the the itching associated with mosquito bites, side effects were limited.",
            "The researchers are now keen to replicate their results in a larger trial.",
            "The work \u201cshould be followed by more extensive studies to confirm GA2\u2019s viability as a candidate for global malaria control\u201d, says Hafalla.",

Certain viruses and bacteria found in the gut microbiome are known to change a person\u2019s risk of obesity4, and social scientist Nicholas Christakis wondered whether friends pass these microbes to each other in addition to influencing each other\u2019s eating habits. \u201cThis was a kernel of an idea that I just couldn\u2019t let go,\u201d says Christakis, who is based at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.",

Christakis and his colleagues travelled to the jungles of Honduras to add to this emerging literature.

            "Dias joined Rochester as a professor in 2017, fresh from a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he claimed to have produced metallic hydrogen. In theory, when hydrogen is compressed to pressures greater than that at Earth\u2019s centre, it should transform from an insulating gas into a superconducting metal. The results were never reproduced, and many scientists doubted them.",
            "Nature retracts controversial superconductivity paper by embattled physicist",
            "At Rochester, Dias turned his eye to other high-pressure superconductors. In October 2020, he published a breakthrough study in Nature1, which claimed that a compound made of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen (CSH) is a superconductor at room temperature. And in March 2023, he published another claim in Nature2, finding that a compound of lutetium, hydrogen and nitrogen is a room-temperature superconductor at pressures 100 times lower than CSH \u2014 conditions even more practical for commercial use. (Nature\u2019s news team is editorially independent from its journals team.)",

At the same time, Jorge Hirsch, a theorist at the University of California, San Diego, raised questions that led to three inquiries at the university. None found evidence of misconduct, however. Nature\u2019s journal editors meanwhile retracted the CSH paper after they conscripted independent specialists to review it, and those specialists found evidence of data fabrication.",

Ordered to by the NSF, Rochester launched a full misconduct investigation.",

            "Eleanor Maguire wasn\u2019t too thrilled when she was first offered an Ig Nobel Prize. The neuroscientist at University College London was being honoured for her study showing that London taxi drivers have larger hippocampi in their brains than do people in other professions1. But she worried that accepting the prize would be a disaster for her career. So, she quietly turned it down.",
            "Three years later, the prize\u2019s founder, Marc Abrahams, contacted Maguire again with the same offer. This time, she knew more about the satirical award that bills itself as honouring achievements that \u201cmake people laugh, then think\u201d. She decided to accept. On the way to the ceremony, her taxi driver was so delighted to learn about his enlarged hippocampus that he refused to accept a fee from her.",
            "Maguire credits the prize with bringing more attention to her work. \u201cIt was useful for my career because people wanted to talk about it,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cit was on the front pages of newspapers when it came out and struck a chord with people.\u201d",
            "How to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?",
            "As one measure of the Ig Nobel\u2019s impact, Maguire says that she was once introduced as \u201cthe most famous member\u201d of a panel that happened to also include three Nobel laureates. \u201cThere were only questions about taxi drivers, and not anything to the Nobel laureates there.\u201d",
            "Other researchers have similar stories about winning the famous \u2014 some would say \u2018infamous\u2019 \u2014 awards. Abrahams created them in 1991, after years of collecting examples of weird research that he included in the Journal of Irreproducible Results, which he was editor of at the time. \u201cI kept meeting people who\u2019d unknowingly done very funny things that almost no one knew about.\u201d",
            "The response from the scientific community was mixed at the start, but Abrahams says that the Ig Nobels are not out to harm anyone\u2019s career. And last year, the prize received more than 9,000 nominations, a sign of how much it has grown, he says.",
            "Beyond the fun, several researchers who have won an \u2018Ig\u2019 say that it has improved their careers by helping them to reach wider audiences, and it has prompted some scientists to spend more time engaging with the public about their work. Here are their stories.",

            "For Kees Moeliker, an Ig Nobel had a profound influence on his work \u2014 and his life. In 1995, the ornithologist was looking out of the glass wall of his office at the Natural History Museum Rotterdam in the Netherlands, when he heard the sound of a duck flying into it. He went outside and saw a live duck mounting the dead one that had just hit the window. It was the first documented case of homosexual necrophilia in ducks, says Moeliker, who reported his findings six years later2. He expected that only a handful of people would read the paper, but then he received a phone call in 2003 offering him an Ig Nobel Prize.",
            "\u201cAfter I won the prize, my paper got a huge readership, and people keep sending me stuff that you don\u2019t read about in the mainstream journals,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a huge compilation of cases of remarkable animal behaviour.\u201d",

            "The duck paper and the Ig Nobel marked a turning point for Moeliker. He became known as \u2018the duck guy\u2019 and published a book of the same name: De eendenman (2009; in Dutch). In 2013, he gave a TED Talk titled \u2018How a dead duck changed my life\u2019.",
            "Since the Ig Nobel, Moeliker has dedicated a large part of his life to science communication alongside his research. Now the director of the museum in Rotterdam, he has also kept up his connection with the Ig Nobels. He is part of the team that decides who wins, and he often informs scientists in Europe who have been selected.",
            "One of his favourite winners was a pair of researchers who had dressed up as polar bears to study how reindeer in the Arctic would react. \u201cWhen I called them, they just started screaming with happiness. This happens all the time.\u201d",
            "h2Friday-night experiments",
            "The only person with both a Nobel and Ig Nobel Prize is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for the discovery of graphene, but the Ig Nobel came a decade earlier for a very different kind of work: using a magnet to levitate a frog. One Friday night at Radboud University in the Netherlands, Geim poured water into a powerful 16-tesla magnet and found that it levitated. The floating drop shocked his colleagues because it seemed to violate ideas about magnetism.",
            "Success with water led to a series of other experiments with levitating objects \u2014 and eventually with a small frog that survived its wild ride unharmed.",
            "You must be joking: funny paper titles might lead to more citations",
            "When Geim was offered the award, he was an early-career researcher and wary of accepting it on his own. So he reached out to Michael Berry, a theoretical physicist at the University of Bristol, UK, and Geim\u2019s co-author on a paper describing the levitating frog3. As a tenured academic, Berry provided the cover of being associated with a highly respected scientist.",
            "Geim talks often about his frog experiment and the value of the curiosity-led science that led to his Ig Nobel Prize. It was on another Friday night, several years after the levitation experiments, that Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who is now at the National University of Singapore, stuck a piece of tape to graphite, leading to their discovery of graphene4 \u2014 and their shared Nobel prize.",
            "Geim and Maguire aren\u2019t the only Ig Nobel winners who had qualms about accepting the prize. And Abrahams has built in allowances for that. He and his colleagues contact potential recipients confidentially months before the prize-giving ceremony and offer them the chance to accept or reject the award. Abrahams also arranges for them to be handed out by Nobel prize-winners at the annual ceremony. \u201cTo have these credible people be a part of it makes it much harder for anyone to jump to the conclusion that we are out to do damage,\u201d he says.",
            "Not everyone has been so pleased to receive the award. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, was part of a group of nearly 1,000 people who won the 1993 Ig Nobel Literature prize for \u201cpublishing a medical research paper which has one hundred times as many authors as pages\u201d. He says that the study should not have been made light of; at the time, it was the largest heart-attack study in history, with more than 40,000 participants5, he adds.",
            "Topol says that he thinks the name Ig Nobel \u201cis out of alignment with the more recent ones. They\u2019re more for humour\u2019s sake.\u201d",
            "Abrahams agrees, saying, \u201cIn retrospect, I kind of wish we\u2019d chosen a different name.\u201d",
            "h2Running on water",
            "In the past two decades, most of the awards have gone to lighter research \u2014 sometimes quite literally. So it was for a 2013 prize for Alberto Minetti at the University of Milan in Italy.",
            "Minetti studies the biomechanics of locomotion and has long had an interest in the forces involved in running. When he learnt that spacecraft orbiting the Moon had detected evidence of water in 2008, he wondered whether a person could run on water on the Moon, which has a gravitational force only about 16% as strong as that of Earth.",
            "Using mathematical models from the basilisk lizard (Basiliscus basiliscus) and the western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), two vertebrates that can run on the surface of water, Minetti calculated that it was theoretically possible. Then, he and his colleagues tested their calculations by attaching a person to a harness to simulate weaker gravity. With the aid of small fins on his feet, a participant was able to stay afloat while running in place in a wading pool, the researchers reported6 in 2012.",
            "The following year, Minetti received a phone call from Abrahams, who offered him an Ig Nobel. At the time, he wasn\u2019t sure of the prize\u2019s standing or what it would do to his reputation, so he conducted a survey among his colleagues. \u201cMost of the people I spoke to were very positive about it,\u201d says Minetti.",

The lead author of the study7, Ryo Okabe at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, has been treating patients as a clinician for more than 15 years, while also carrying out research projects. The research behind the Ig Nobel was a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers wanted to see whether they could develop an alternative breathing method in the event of respiratory failure.",
            "He was honoured to win the prize and thinks that the award will be a driving force to conduct future research. \u201cI learnt that [the other laureates] are all engaged in their respective research with humour and passion.\u201d",

            "The Ig Nobel has come a long way since it was launched more than three decades ago. What started as a prize that scientists were wary of has been embraced by many.",
            "Minna Lyons, who won the prize in 2014 along with her colleagues, still cherishes her Ig Nobel. \u201cIt has been one of the best surprises in my academic career, by far.\u201d She won for \u201camassing evidence that people who habitually stay up late are, on average, more self-admiring, more manipulative, and more psychopathic than people who wake up early in the morning\u201d.",
            "Lyons, who is a psychologist at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, says that the prize is excellent for public engagement because it makes science popular, and for this reason, the Ig Nobel is one of the most respected academic awards in her field, she says.",

But when dropped again, they didn\u2019t curl them. The plants had learned that the drop wasn\u2019t going to hurt them, the researchers concluded.",
            "A month later, they tried the experiment again. The plants still didn\u2019t curl their leaves after being dropped. It was as though they remembered it wouldn\u2019t hurt them. They had formed long-lasting memories.",

            "Scientists first predicted such an electric field in the 1960s. This was at the dawn of the space age. Early spacecraft flying over Earth\u2019s poles detected a supersonic outflow of ions \u2014 charged particles \u2014 exiting the atmosphere. They called it a polar wind.",
            "The most reasonable thing to explain that speedy wind would be some electric field. How? Sunlight might kick electrons out of atoms in the upper atmosphere. Those negatively charged electrons are energetic and light enough that they want to float out into space. Left behind are positively charged oxygen ions. Being heavier, they want to sink down in Earth\u2019s gravity.",
            "But the atmosphere wants to remain electrically neutral \u2014 neither positive nor negative \u2014 by keeping an equal balance between electrons and positive ions. So this electric field forms. It keeps the electrons tied to the ions, which prevents them from escaping.",
            "Once established, the field can act as a booster for lighter ions, such as hydrogen. It gives them enough energy to break free of Earth\u2019s gravity. Now they zoom away, forming that polar wind. The field also pulls heavier ions higher up into the atmosphere than they would otherwise reach. Here, other forces can propel them, too, into space.",

            "Two more days of blizzards kept Endurance grounded. When the rocket finally launched on May 11, 2022, it went straight up through the atmosphere to a height of around 770 kilometers (480 miles). Along the way, it measured the energies of electrons every 10 seconds. The flight lasted 19 minutes. Afterward, the rocket fell back to Earth, splashing down in the Greenland Sea.",
            "Between 248 and 768 kilometers up, Endurance detected a change in the electric potential of 0.55 volt. That\u2019s not much. But it was exactly enough to explain the polar wind.",

He also cautions that it\u2019s only one data point and from just one rocket. \u201cThis result is a really great result,\u201d he says, but one that \u201cargues there should be more measurements like this.\u201d",

Jakosky, who works at the University of Colorado Boulder, led a team that measured that loss. And Venus used to be much wetter, data suggest.",

            "Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth\u2019s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.",
            "Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",
            "Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth\u2019s inner structure. They\u2019ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists \u2014 \u00a0including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago \u2014 have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth\u2019s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Writing things out by hand might seem boring and slow. But handwriting can boost links across brain regions. That includes some with roles in learning and memory. The new finding adds to growing evidence of handwriting\u2019s benefits.",
            "Scientists snooped on the brain activity of college students who wrote by hand or typed words. Compared with when they typed, more of the students\u2019 brain regions worked together when students scribbled with a pen. This trend also showed up in brainwaves \u2014 patterns of electrical activity \u2014 that have been linked with forming memories. That might mean writing notes by hand could boost memory of the material for a test, for instance.",
            "Previous research had shown that handwriting improves spelling and the ability to remember what you\u2019ve learned. Handwriting also strengthens the understanding of concepts. Scientists think that the slow process of tracing out letters and words gives people more time to process material and learn it.",
            "This new study hints at why handwriting seems so good for memory. \u201cThere is a fundamental difference in brain organization for handwriting, as opposed to typing,\u201d says Ramesh Balasubramaniam. A neuroscientist, he works at the University of California, Merced. He did not take part in the new work.",
            "Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel are psychologists. They study the human mind at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. The pair recruited college students for their new study. They showed students a word on a computer screen, then asked them to type or handwrite it in cursive with a digital pen. All the while, sensors in caps they wore recorded electrical activity in their brains.",
            "Brainwaves look like wiggles of electrical activity. The scientists examined the waves\u2019 frequency, which is how many times the waves pulsed per second. The team was looking for different brain regions whose waves were in sync. When those waves have the same frequency at the same time, it hints at how strongly the areas are linked while working on some task.\u00a0",
            "With handwriting, the researchers expected to see an increase of brain activity in areas linked to movement. But they also saw a boost in certain waves related to learning and memory. And when students wrote by hand, intriguing connections emerged.",

            "Handwriting \u2014 but not typing \u2014 increased the link between the brain\u2019s outer parts (which play roles in moving and sensing) and central parts. Some of those central brain areas play a role in memory. The findings suggest these brain areas join forces during handwriting in a way that they don\u2019t during typing.",
            "The scientists shared their results January 26 in Frontiers in Psychology.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0",
            "Even when the movements are very similar, the brain\u2019s activity seems \u201cmuch, much higher\u201d in handwriting, Balasubramaniam says. \u201cIt shows that there\u2019s more involvement of these brain regions when you\u2019re handwriting.\u201d That could aid learning. That\u2019s because certain brainwaves that get a boost play a role in making and storing memories.",
            "The team did not test whether the students remembered the words they wrote or typed. So it\u2019s not yet clear how the increased brain activity affects learning, says Kathleen Arnold. A psychologist, she works at Radford University in Virginia. More study is needed on the differences in brain linkages and whether they align with how well people learn.",
            "Differences in brain activity could be due to the unique movements required to type or write, Balasubramaniam notes. \u201cBut that said, we\u2019ve got to start somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are the first results to actually show that these two things have different brain-activation patterns.\u201d",
            "Handwriting may aid learning. But typing is often easier, faster and more practical. So students and teachers alike should decide, based on the task, whether to write it out or type, van der Meer says. For example, using handwriting to take notes might help you hang on to information, while typing an essay could help you get ideas down to the page faster, before you forget them.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Though more work is needed to find the best strategy for learning, handwriting has shown its value. So it shouldn\u2019t be left behind in the digital age. \u201c[Schools] need to bring in more writing into curriculum design,\u201d Balasubramaniam says. Some places are even creating laws that would make students handwrite more. For instance, a recent California law requires that students learn cursive in first through sixth grades.",
            "Van der Meer agrees that handwriting should stick around: \u201c[Writing is] so good for [young] brains.\u201d A generation without handwriting would almost be like guinea pigs living through an experiment to see what happens to their brains, she says. Even more, they\u2019d lose part of the experience of being human, she adds.",

(Those are signs the story is trying to play into people\u2019s confirmation bias.) Is the story, or the home page of the publication, trying to sell anything? (If so, this story really may be an ad.)",
            "Does the story use all capital letters or a lot of exclamation points? (Those are bad signs.) Are the sources in the story identified by name? Does the story include the author\u2019s name? Can you find the news anywhere else? (Those are good signs.)\u00a0",
            "Here is a worksheet from the News Literacy Project that you can use to answer these questions.\u00a0",
            "Then look carefully at the details, advises Frank Baker. Trained as a journalist, he lives in South Carolina and is a media-education consultant. That\u2019s someone who helps teachers teach about news.\u00a0He says to check out the website logo: Is that the real CNN logo, or one that looks a lot like it? Also, look at the URL at the top of a website. (For example, the URL abcnews.com.co is not ABC News, a legitimate news outlet, even though it looks almost the same. The real site is abcnews.com.)",
            "2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Know your \u201cnews neighborhood,\u201d says Baker.\u00a0People should think about where they found each story they read, he says. If someone shared a story with you on social media, do you know where it was published first? Is it from a talk-radio show? A gossip site? An online newspaper?",
            "Knowing where the story came from will help you understand what its goal is. This can change even within one publication, like a newspaper. Are you reading a news story on the front page of a newspaper? Then it\u2019s trying to inform you. Is it a column on the editorial page? A newspaper\u2019s editorial page is where writers share opinions, so a story here is trying to persuade you.",
            "3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Analyze the pictures. A photo is often the first thing that draws you to a story \u2014 so don\u2019t forget to ask critical questions about images, Baker says. Is the photo related to the news story it\u2019s attached to? Why is it there? What was the photographer trying to communicate? What angle was the photo taken from? (When a photographer is shooting down on a subject, it tends to make the subject appear powerless, Baker says. When the camera is looking up at the person, they appear powerful.)",
            "4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use professional tools. If you can\u2019t find the answers to these questions, search for your story on fact-checking sites such as Snopes.com, FactCheck.org or PolitiFact.com to see if it\u2019s been reported as fake.",

If you\u2019re questioning something a politician said, she suggests searching for a few key words on FactCheck.org. If you\u2019re wondering about a meme or a story shared via social media, try Snopes. If you suspect a photo might have been manipulated, or might not show what its caption claims, do a reverse image search. This will show you where the image has appeared before. (To do a reverse image search, click on the camera icon in Google Images and enter the URL for the photo.)",
            "Of course, it only takes a second to share a story on Facebook. Going through all these steps will take a lot longer. But the more you practice these tools, the more they will become habit.\u00a0",
            "You can think about that quick, thoughtless share on Facebook like fast food: easy and unhealthy. The opposite of fast food is a movement called \u201cslow food,\u201d which encourages farming and traditional cooking techniques. These practices take longer but are better for people and the environment.",
            "Spikes compares the process of telling fact from fiction on the internet to the slow food movement. He calls being a responsible news consumer part of the \u201cslow information movement.\u201d It means taking time to step back before jumping to a conclusion.

He\u2019s a chemical biologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He\u2019s also a founder of Algenesis Materials. It\u2019s a company developing a new plastic.",
            "Most plastics have been made from crude oil, a fossil fuel. Four years ago, Burkart\u2019s team at UCSD developed a new type. They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",
            "The researchers described the finding March 12 in Scientific Reports.",
            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",
            "Compost has everything the plastic needs to degrade: microbes to break it down plus water. The material also can break down in wet soil or the ocean.",
            "But the new plastic won\u2019t break down while you\u2019re using it, says Stephen Mayfield. He\u2019s a molecular geneticist at UCSD. He\u2019s also the chief executive officer of Algenesis Materials. To break down the microplastics, \u201cyou need them to be wet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you break that cycle, even for a short period of time, you kill the microorganisms.\u201d",

            "When microbes break down plant materials, such as cellulose, they release carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. The researchers decided to compare the CO2 output of microbes dining on the new microplastic to when they ate cellulose.",
            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",
            "The scientists also coated a piece of fabric in the new plastic. After being mixed with the compost for two weeks, that fabric easily broke apart. Another piece of the coated fabric was not composted. It was still intact after two weeks.",

            "Polyurethane is sometimes used to coat natural fibers, like wool and cotton, for clothing, Erdle says. Over time, that plastic coating flakes off, \u201cfragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces and never going away.\u201d Having something that can readily be broken down by bacteria, she says, is better than \u201chaving persistent plastic in the environment.\u201d",

These might, for example, replace materials currently used in food packaging, he says. And then \u201cyou just chuck that thing in a compost pile and it becomes mulch in about 90 days.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat I want is for people to have hope that there are solutions\u201d to the microplastics problem, says Burkart. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t have to accept the status quo.\u201d"

            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

(You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",
            "But it\u2019s difficult to study how materials behave under the extreme conditions required for fusion. And that\u2019s where the mayonnaise comes in.",
            "The behavior of the fuel capsule in fusion experiments, it turns out, has a lot in common with mayonnaise. The fuel capsule is a metal or other material that contains a gas (the fuel). When lasers hit the capsule, it melts. The melty capsule can now switch from elastic to plastic.",
            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Two mechanical engineers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., wanted to understand that better. So they looked at how mayo mixes with a gas \u2014 air. Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",
            "The scientists observed the glob while the wheel was spinning. They looked at it again after it stopped. They checked whether the mayo had returned to its original form, changed shape or broken apart. This determined the border between its elastic and plastic behaviors, they explain in the May Physical Review E.",
            "Working with mayo does have one drawback. When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"

            "It\u2019s common to get a minor cut while flipping through a magazine or book. But tissue paper is not likely to draw blood. Now, scientists have explained the physics behind why some paper is more likely to slice through skin.",
            "Physicist Kaare Jensen was part of a team that set up experiments to study this. They used a gelatin replica of human tissue. Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",
            "The most treacherous paper tested was the kind used in old-fashioned dot matrix printers. Good news for fingers everywhere: That paper isn\u2019t used much anymore. Magazine paper ranked a close second in the scientists\u2019 tests.",
            "The slicing angle also mattered. Pressing the paper\u2019s edge straight down into the gelatin was less likely to cause a cut than if the paper\u2019s path angled across and down.",
            "Next, the researchers put paper\u2019s slicing powers to use. They designed a 3-D printed tool they call the Papermachete. Loaded with a strip of printer paper, the tool becomes a single-use knife. The paper blade can cut into cucumber, pepper and apple. It can even cut chicken. The tool could be a low-cost option for prepping some foods.",
            "Next, the researchers plan to study more realistic, finger-shaped materials, rather than flat sheets of gelatin, says Jensen.",
            "No human fingers were harmed in the making of the study. \u201cIdeally, you would want some test subjects,\u201d Jensen says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to find volunteers.\u201d"

            "The heart beats steadily from long before you\u2019re born to the day you die. Triggering each beat (illustrated in background by an electrocardiogram line) is a zap of electricity \u2014 literally the pulse of life. ",
            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",

            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",

That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."

In Zambia, where 83 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity comes from hydropower, the drought also decimated its ability to generate power as the nation\u2019s lakes and rivers dried up.

Some scientists are helping corals evolve more quickly by lab-breeding the symbiotic organisms that live inside them to be heat resistant. Others are gardening coral reefs in the wild so heat-resistant species can find each other and mate more easily.",

            "Working off previous studies that established that some corals naturally withstand heat better than others, the Coralassist team began its project by systematically mapping and heat testing 100 Acropora digitifera coral colonies in the highly diverse reefs of Palau, in the western Pacific Ocean. They exposed fragments from each colony to a temperature stress challenge in a laboratory tank that emulated the duration and intensity of marine heat waves. One group spent 10 days in water that gradually warmed by 3.5 degrees C; another group spent a month in water warmed by 2.5 degrees C.",

            "The team then selected the top and bottom performers and started matchmaking. Those with high heat tolerance would mingle their eggs and sperm together. Low-tolerance corals were similarly paired, and some couples were a mix of both. The resulting larvae, after attaching to ceramic tiles, were moved to nursery tanks on a local reef, where they grew for three to four years.",
            "At the end of their study, the team found that the heritability of heat tolerance was between 0.2 and 0.3 on a scale of 0 to 1, indicating that \u201cabout a quarter of the variability in offspring heat tolerance was due to genes passed from their parents,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe response is not completely genetically driven, the environment also has some influence,\u201d says Adriana Humanes, a marine ecologist in the Coralassist Lab. \u201cBut you have a huge component of the genetics that is influencing the response to the heat stress.\u201d",
            "In their trials, the tolerance of adult offspring of high-heat-tolerant parents was increased through breeding by almost 1 \u201cdegree-heating week,\u201d a metric that refers to how much heat stress has accumulated in an area over the previous 12 weeks, compared to the corals with low-heat-tolerance parents. The study serves as proof of concept that selective breeding can boost heat tolerance in just one generation and endure into adulthood.\n",
            "BQThe genes that make a coral more tolerant to heat might also make it less fertile and slower growing, says a researcher.",
            "While the experiment showed there is scope for breeding, the improvement in heat resistance was still \u201cpretty modest compared to climate change,\u201d says Liam Lachs, an ecologist from the Coralassist lab who ran the team\u2019s statistical calculations. This year Palau\u2019s waters warmed at 10 degree-heating weeks, and the Caribbean hit 20 degree-heating weeks. In addition, the corals that were more heat resistant to short zaps of heat didn\u2019t do as well under longer-term exposure to heat, indicating that different genes might be responsible for resistance to different durations of heat.",
            "Coral researchers know that there is no single gene that confers heat resistance on corals: It\u2019s a \u201cvery complex trait encoded by many genes,\u201d says Annika Lamb, who runs a similar project with corals from the Great Barrier Reef at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). Her lab is also trying to selectively breed heat-resistant corals, but she\u2019s using a faster method \u2014 applying a quick heat zap \u2014 as well as focusing on breeding corals from different species in the hopes of making sturdier hybrids.",
            "Breeding efforts must also take into consideration tradeoffs. The genes that make a coral more tolerant to heat might also make it less tolerant to disease, less fertile, less resistant to storms or cold, and slower growing, says Lamb. ",
            "Given these considerations, her team is also selectively breeding just the microalgae that live inside corals, which are to a large extent responsible for the actual temperature tolerance of a coral colony, says Madeleine van Oppen, head of AIMS\u2019 coral assisted-evolution project.\n",

            "Van Oppen has been selecting an array of microalgae from coral around the Great Barrier Reef, bolstering their heat tolerance by exposing multiple generations, over the course of 10 years, to elevated temperatures in a lab, and then reintroducing them into chemically bleached adult coral fragments.",
            "After initial lab tests, van Oppen started a trial on an inshore reef of the Great Barrier Reef. The results so far have been \u201creally promising,\u201d she says. During last summer\u2019s heat wave the corals inoculated with heat-evolved microalgae paled less and photosynthesized better than corals with closely related microalgae that hadn\u2019t been boosted for heat tolerance. But there are still questions about whether the microalgae will spread and stay healthy, and whether there are factors in the wild that haven\u2019t yet been taken into account. \u201cThis is a very young field,\u201d says van Oppen. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s a lot of unknown still.\u201d",
            "For instance, studies show that corals reared in labs often have weakened skeletons. This suggests they could be compromised once planted in ocean waters, says Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia. \u201cDespite long-standing claims that heat-tolerant super-corals can be bred in the laboratory and used to re-populate reefs, we still don\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s true,\u201d he says, noting that adding artificially bred corals to the wild gene pool is unlikely to make a significant difference except in extreme circumstances, as natural selection is already changing the mix of coral species on reefs.\n",
            "BQA million newly settled corals might sound like a lot, but \u201cin reality it\u2019s a drop in the ocean,\u201d says a marine biologist.",
            "\u201cCorals are always complicated. They\u2019re always doing something unexpected,\u201d says Stanford\u2019s Palumbi, whose lab is identifying heat-resistant corals in the wild and then running what he calls \u201ccommon gardening\u201d experiments on them. \u201cThese corals have been [evolving tolerance to changing conditions] for hundreds of thousands of years. They\u2019re already out there,\u201d says Palumbi, who also works in Palau, among other places. By collecting thousands of coral fragments from different reefs, testing them for resistance to a heat zap, and then moving the more heat-tolerant species and colonies to human-made reefs on metal frames, his team is giving them a chance to breed with a broader gene pool. ",
            "Preliminary findings from these tests, says Palumbi, suggest their offspring are similar in heat tolerance to Coralassist\u2019s 1 degree-heating week corals. \u201cWe\u2019re basically pursuing two pretty different but very parallel and complementary ways of looking at the same question,\u201d says Palumbi. But the new paper by the Coralassist team is the first to quantify an uptick in heat tolerance. \u201cThat number is something that really hasn\u2019t appeared in any other paper so far,\u201d he says.\n",
            "Still, the practical difficulties and costs of coral husbandry shouldn\u2019t be overlooked, says Hughes, and coral reef restoration is far more expensive than restoring seagrasses or mangroves. A million newly settled corals might sound like a lot, but \u201cin reality it\u2019s a drop in the ocean,\u201d says Hughes, who notes that the total area of reef worldwide currently occupied by laboratory-reared corals is a handful of square meters.",

            "\u201cThe most we can do in terms of reef restoration will always be very small in scale relative to the area to be covered,\u201d says Christopher Jury, a reef ecologist at the University of Hawai\u2019i at M\u0101noa. But recovering reefs the whole world over was never the goal, he says. Restoration efforts can protect small areas intended to provide seed material which, through normal reproduction, larval dispersal, and settlement on the seafloor, can foster the rejuvenation of reefs elsewhere. Of course, substantial climate change mitigation is a prerequisite if any of these other strategies are going to work to preserve reefs, he says, and breeding efforts are just meant to buy coral communities some extra time.\n",
            "The fact that coral abundance has plummeted due to climate change doesn\u2019t negate the fact that rapid evolution is already happening naturally in some surviving coral populations. When Jury\u2019s team semi-enclosed a naturally occurring coral reef community off Oahu and, for two years, subjected it to a combination of 2 degrees C warming and -0.2 pH units of acidification \u2014 akin to what oceans will experience with current rates of global warming \u2014 the communities shifted and changed while maintaining high rates of biodiversity. The corals recruited a diverse assemblage of algae, invertebrates, and microbes that helped them withstand the heat. So there is hope.",
            "Ultimately, the data gathered from all the experiments underway can help researchers improve their models of how corals will fare under global warming, says James Guest, the researcher who led the Coralassist Lab work. That team recently plugged their data from years of breeding experiments into computer models that will provide guidance on where and when interventions will be necessary and effective under various climate change scenarios. This work is forthcoming in Science.",
            "\u201cThere will be some instances where it\u2019s better just to leave the corals to their devices,\u201d says Guest. \u201cIt\u2019s just keeping a really open mind and constantly being prepared to update the advice based on new research.\u201d"

            "*Planned_hydrogen_hubs_Source_Department_of_Energy",
            "In the fall of 2023, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for seven hydrogen hubs, slated to be built across the country over the next eight to 12 years. If all goes as planned, one of those hubs, the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2) \u2014 a network of more than a dozen interconnected hydrogen production centers, storage facilities, pipelines, and new solar farms that will power these operations \u2014 will stretch from southeastern Pennsylvania and neighboring southern New Jersey into Delaware. Expected to receive $750 million in federal funding, MACH2 is projected to create roughly 20,800 jobs in the Delaware Valley region, of which 6,400 will be permanent.",
            "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) says that a sufficiently robust buildout of hydrogen production could power steelmaking, cement production, and other energy-intensive heavy industries, which account for more than a fifth of national carbon emissions and have been notoriously hard to decarbonize, as well as fueling ships, airplanes, and trucks. But some environmentalists and energy experts question whether investing so much money in hydrogen could siphon funding from more effective decarbonization strategies. Even a so-called \u201cgreen\u201d hub, which runs entirely on renewable energy, they say, might not provide the promised carbon-reduction benefits and could potentially even increase emissions.",
            "And residents of potential host communities \u2014 particularly the hard-pressed city of Chester, Pennsylvania, where some of the MACH2 facilities are planned \u2014 are concerned that they will bear the brunt of the potential risks and health hazards that hydrogen production and transport could bring.\n",
            "BQFew details about the Mid-Atlantic hydrogen hub have been shared with the public, unnerving community groups. ",
            "Scientists discovered how to extract usable hydrogen from water molecules using electrolysis in the 1800s, and as far back as 1874, novelist Jules Verne predicted it would someday be \u201cthe coal of the future.\u201d Hydrogen is, after all, the most abundant element on the planet, and it produces no carbon emissions when burned. The United States already produces 10 million metric tons of hydrogen a year \u2014 but most of it is derived from natural gas and is largely used in petroleum refining and in making ammonia for manufacturing fertilizer. Every ton of ammonia produced generates 2.6 tons of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report published in Green Chemistry.",
            "Still, scaling up low- or zero-carbon hydrogen production wasn\u2019t considered financially viable until passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which offer substantial tax credits to producers of clean hydrogen. ",
            "Today, some proposed hubs are planning on producing \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen \u2014 that is, hydrogen created using natural gas but with the resulting carbon emissions captured and stored underground. Representatives of the MACH2 hub say that 82 percent of their production will be \u201cgreen,\u201d meaning powered by solar and wind; 15 percent will be \u201cpink\u201d \u2014 powered by the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear plants, in southern New Jersey; and the remaining 3 percent will be \u201corange\u201d \u2014 powered by biogas, which is produced when organic matter decomposes in an anaerobic environment.",

More information will be released in the project\u2019s next phase, expected to begin in the coming year.",
            "The lack of specificity has unnerved environmental and community groups. The Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental advocacy nonprofit, is alarmed by what it sees as a lack of proper safety precautions. Part of MACH2\u2019s plan involves repurposing old fossil fuel infrastructure to carry hydrogen. Like many aspects of the project, what that means isn\u2019t yet clear.",
            "MACH2 officials are currently creating an inventory of underutilized infrastructure, according to Matt Krayton, the communications lead for the hub. He says the hub would likely repurpose existing pipeline rights of way \u2014 every pipeline needs approval from landowners whose property would be crossed \u2014 and possibly the pipelines themselves, which would be re-sleeved with a hydrogen-safe polymer to prevent leaks.\n",
            "BQMaking green hydrogen to power short-haul planes and heavy-duty vehicles is neither economical nor efficient, a report finds.",
            "Some 1,600 miles of hydrogen pipelines are already operating across the U.S., and Nick Barilo, executive director of the Center for Hydrogen Safety at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, noted that all combustible fuels carry a certain amount of risk, and hydrogen is no more dangerous than natural gas. \u201cThe U.S. industry has been using hydrogen for over a century,\u201d Barilo said. \u201cSafety knowledge and best practices for the production and transportation of hydrogen are well-established and mature.\u201d ",
            "In some potential host communities, like Chester, Pennsylvania, assurances like Barilo\u2019s fall flat. Fifteen miles outside of Philadelphia, the city once bustled with manufacturing and heavy industry. But after World War II, plants began to shutter, and the city entered a long decline. By 2020, its population was half its 1950 peak.\n",
            "Today, a third of Chester residents live in poverty, and the city, which declared bankruptcy in 2022, is host to 11 industries classified by the DEP as hazardous, including one of the largest incinerators in the nation.

But the industry still faces headwinds over its potential costs and benefits.",
            "Although burning hydrogen produces no direct greenhouse gas emissions, hydrogen that leaks into the atmosphere, according to a 2022 research paper published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, increases concentrations of other greenhouse gases, like methane, ozone, and water vapor. \u201cAny time you\u2019re handling [hydrogen], producing it, transporting it, storing it \u2014 [the molecule] is so small that the risk of leaks is significant,\u201d said Talor Musil, a field manager at the Pennsylvania-based nonprofit Environmental Health Project.\n",
            "And according to a recent report published by Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, an energy and climate policy think tank, making green hydrogen to power short-haul planes and heavy-duty vehicles \u2014 two sectors often touted as ripe for adopting hydrogen \u2014 is neither economical nor efficient. Roughly 20 to 30 percent of hydrogen\u2019s energy value is lost in the process of splitting water molecules, the report said, and another 15 percent may be lost during compression and storage. The Energy Innovation report ranked the potential end uses for hydrogen by their long-term viability and determined that it made the most financial and environmental sense for refining oil and producing ammonia for fertilizer, while also having value in steelmaking and long-haul aviation and marine shipping.",
            "BQWithout strict rules on the use of renewable energy, the hydrogen industry could actually increase overall emissions.",
            "Energy experts agree on these high-value uses for hydrogren, but the Inflation Reduction Act guarantees a tax credit for the fuel, no matter what its end use, for 10 years. Given rapid advances in battery technology, said the Energy Innovations report, it will be hard to justify hydrogen\u2019s expense in industries like trucking \u2014 which can operate far more cheaply using electricity \u2014 when the credit ends. A recent study by a group of Harvard researchers estimated that depending on what it\u2019s ultimately used for, green hydrogen may wind up being even less cost effective at fighting climate change than direct air capture of CO2, which the International Energy Agency estimated would have an operating cost, when scaled up, of between $230 and $630 per metric ton of CO2 captured.",
            "And then there\u2019s the matter of impact. The seven hubs combined are projected to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 25 million metric tons of CO2 a year (not counting the emissions linked with hydrogen production). The total tonnage is not significant, some experts say \u2014 it amounts to less than half of one percent of total U.S. CO2 emissions \u2014 considering the $7 billion in taxpayer support. But the Energy Department considers the hubs a catalyst, a way to \u201ckickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure\u201d; presumably, costs of hydrogen production will drop as the industry develops.\n",

            "Unless the federal government implements strict rules on carbon capture and the use of green energy for the hubs, the industry could actually increase overall emissions, according to the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Last November, Rachel Fakhry, the NRDC\u2019s policy director for emerging technologies, testified before the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee that, for hydrogen to be truly sustainable, green hubs would need to abide by three main tenets: buying electricity from newly built renewable energy sources, rather than pulling existing renewables from the grid (a requirement known as \u201cadditionality\u201d); matching their hourly use with the availability of green energy, which prevents hubs from dipping into fossil fuels and buying clean energy credits after the fact; and using clean energy that\u2019s produced close to the hubs, ensuring that its delivery doesn\u2019t lead to increased emissions. Legislators and industry groups are already indicating they will challenge a proposed additionality requirement.",
            "As the federal government works to finalize how it will regulate the hydrogen tax credits, energy experts continue to grapple with the potential significance, and value, of the proposed hubs. \u201cOne of the big challenges in the broader field of serious, big systems decarbonization is we\u2019re sort of talking about various imaginaries,\u201d said Danny Cullenward, a climate economist and senior fellow at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing money at the hubs. We\u2019re throwing money through this tax credit at the production of hydrogen. But there isn\u2019t really anything resembling a coordinated strategy for what\u2019s the right use of hydrogen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a really weird thing, if you think about it.\u201d"

Hannah Mowat, campaigns coordinator at Fern, a Brussels-based advocate for forests and their inhabitants, says: \u201cIt could be something very good \u2014 promoting local production and increasing revenue stream for communities,\u201d by helping them sell into international markets, for instance. \n",

The principles also include social parameters such as eradicating hunger, protecting Indigenous rights, and equitable sharing of the benefits of the use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge.",

It requires stopping activities such as cattle ranching and mining that threaten Indigenous rights or damage their forests, and instead engaging with local producers to build the infrastructure they need to grow their businesses, such as electricity supplies for refrigerating and processing forest products, and reliable transportation to facilitate trade.

About 50 percent of that loss has been just in the last 100 years or so. That\u2019s how much it\u2019s sped up since the Industrial Revolution. But the nature of forests is changing too.

Another view is we need to restore the functions and the processes of ecosystems and the biodiversity they support, not necessarily this ideal picture of what it was a few thousand years ago.

But because this high density is artificial, it\u2019s controversial. Many ecologists aren\u2019t fans.

It looks quite like a rainforest. He mostly focuses on non-annual plants \u2014 fruits and vegetables, nuts and mushrooms.

            "About 18 months ago, climate scientists began to notice something strange. In March of 2023, global sea surface temperatures started to rise. In a warming world, the seas would be expected to grow hotter, but the rise, which came at a time when the Pacific Ocean was in the neutral phase of the weather pattern known as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, was unusually steep. In April, 2023, sea surface temperatures set a new record. They did so again in May.\n",
            "As the months went on, the weirdness continued. In the summer of 2023, the world entered an El Ni\u00f1o, the warm phase of ENSO. El Ni\u00f1os typically bring higher temperatures, but in the second half of 2023, both sea surface and air temperatures increased so much that scientists were stunned. One called the figures \u201cabsolutely gobsmackingly bananas.\u201d\n",
            "In an essay that appeared in Nature this past March, NASA\u2019s chief climate scientist, Gavin Schmidt said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists\u2019 predictive capabilities more than 2023 has.\u201d\n",
            "Officially, the El Ni\u00f1o ended in May 2024. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high. This year they are expected to set yet another record.",
            "Schmidt says that scientists still can\u2019t explain the unexpected spike in temperatures. When I talked with him recently, he called the continuing confusion \u201ca little embarrassing\u201d for researchers.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/16359609/embed",
            "Scientists have identified several recent developments that could have contributed to the last year and a half of anomalous warmth. The first is a set of rules that reduced the sulfur content of the fuel used in super tankers. Since sulfur dioxide pollution reflects sunlight, this change, while good for public health, could have led to increased ocean heating. ",
            "A second potential contributor is an unusual eruption that occurred in January 2022. Normally, volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide and so produce temporary cooling. But the eruption of Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2018apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific, sent water vapor shooting into the stratosphere, which could have had a warming effect.",
            "Yet another possible contributor is the solar cycle. The sun is currently at, or near, a peak of activity, and this, too, could be boosting temperatures.",
            "At this point, though, Schmidt says, none of these developments \u2014 or even a combination of all of them \u2014 seems sufficient to explain the heat. This, in turn, raises several other possibilities. The recent temperature run-up could be the result of some development that\u2019s yet to be identified. Or it could mean the climate system is more unpredictable than was thought. Alternatively, it could indicate that something is missing from climate models, or that amplifying feedbacks are kicking in sooner than the models had predicted.\n",

            "Gavin Schmidt: We started to see something eyebrow-raising in the spring in 2023. We expected that 2023 would be another warm year because all of the years are warm now, but it probably wasn\u2019t going to be a record-warm year. So when the records started to be broken, first in the North Atlantic in March and April, June, and then the global mean in June, and then throughout the rest of the year, and then absolutely ridiculously large record-breaking events in the fall \u2014 August, September, October, November \u2014 people started using adjectives that scientists don\u2019t generally tend to use.",
            "At the end of 2023, we summed it up: It was a record warm year and it was a record-breaking size of the record. Our eyebrows at this point were rolling over the top of our heads. It was clear that the predictions that people had made at the beginning of year were all wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter what the method was, they were all wrong, and they were all wrong by about 0.2 degrees Celsius. Now that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a big deal. ",
            "You can accommodate a missed prediction in two ways. You can either say, your actual prediction was wrong. Or you can say, no, we underestimated the uncertainty.\n",
            "So at the beginning of 2024, we thought: Hopefully we\u2019ll get some more information from people doing science for all the different things that were happening. And maybe we\u2019ll get some more analyses of the internal variability. Some of that has happened, but not in a coordinated way. And it\u2019s still pretty much, I would say, amateur hour in terms of assessing what actually happened in 2023.",
            "Kolbert: There was a whole list of things people thought might have contributed.",
            "Schmidt: Right. One was a change in regulations by the International Maritime Organization, which took effect in January 2020 to clean up the fuel that was being used for shipping.",
            "BQ \u201cThings are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off.\u201d",
            "One other event was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u02bbapai volcano in the South Pacific, which was a very unusual eruption. It put a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is normally super dry. That was a very new thing, and people were saying, well, maybe that\u2019s contributing.",
            "People were also talking about unusual behavior of the Saharan dust or the wind pattern in the North Atlantic. People were talking about long-term, ongoing changes in how much pollution is coming from China and India. Maybe those things are changing faster than we anticipated. The pollution in the air is a cooling factor, and so if you take it away, then that\u2019s a warming factor.",
            "The science that\u2019s been done has not been equally spread amongst all of those things. A lot of people have looked at the impact of the marine shipping regulation change. If you take that and you put it into some climate model and you estimate the temperature change, right now you\u2019d expect about 0.05 of a degree, 0.08 of a degree [of warming per year], and then building over a decade to about 0.1 degree. So that seems like it helps, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s sufficient. And the first paper that came out about the volcano, they said, no, no, the normal cooling volcanic pollution is still bigger than the warming water vapor component. So now I have more warming to explain and less things to explain it.\n",

            "Schmidt: Like I said, there\u2019s two reasons why you could have messed up the prediction. One is you are missing some driving element. Another is you are underestimating the spread. Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off. And you could think of things being more off in multiple ways because the system is changing in a way where what happened in the past is no longer a good guide to what\u2019s going to happen in the future. And that\u2019s concerning. For example, we have huge industries and huge expectations based on temperature anomalies that are associated with [El Ni\u00f1o].\n",
            "So if we predict an [El Ni\u00f1o] coming, then people in Africa start planting different crops. People in Indonesia start preparing for a dry season. If the connections between the rest of the world and what\u2019s happening in the tropical Pacific are changing, then all of those previous practices or recommendations based on the past relationships, maybe they\u2019re no longer any good.

And for most things it\u2019s probably fine, but I\u2019d feel a lot more confident if we had a process in place that updated these things, not every day, but maybe once a year.\n",

What concerns you most as a dad about the data that you\u2019ve seen over the last year and a half?",
            "Schmidt: My daughter was born in 2015, which means that she may well live to 2100. So the projections that we make, she\u2019ll see how that all works out.",
            "We are looking at very, very small amounts of tea leaves to try and predict the future. What happened this month? What happened last month? What was going on in Sahara? What was going on in the Antarctica?",

And they dwarf the uncertainties that we\u2019re talking about here. We\u2019re talking 0.1, 0.2 degrees. Well, the difference emissions make is 1 degree, 2 degrees, 3 degrees. So it\u2019s an order of magnitude larger. And given the non-linearity of impacts, that\u2019s a much, much larger amount of impact that we would see.",

That\u2019s very difficult to predict. I have this feeling that what we\u2019re doing will influence these decisions, but I don\u2019t know how it will influence these decisions. And so my best plan is just to do the best that we can in terms of the science and hope that by knowing more about the system, people will make better choices. But obviously that\u2019s hopelessly naive.",

It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. ",
            "Today Taiwan\u2019s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan\u2019s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. ",
            "It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent.\n",

In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan\u2019s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC.",

But just one small data center, the Vantage 16MW Data center in Taipei, is expected to require as much energy as some 13,000 households. Nicholas Chen, a lawyer who analyses Taiwan\u2019s climate and energy policies, warns that the collision of Taiwan\u2019s commitments to the clean energy transition and its position in global supply chains as a key partner of multinational companies that have made commitments to net-zero deadlines \u2014 along with the explosive growth in demand \u2014 has all the makings of a crisis.\n",

Its major companies, TSMC included, have signed up to RE100, a corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged to achieve net zero production. But right now, there is a wide gap between aspiration and performance. ",

When we met in a restaurant in Taipei, she cheerfully ordered an implausibly large number of dishes that crowded onto the small table as we talked. Oung described two major blackouts \u2014 one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge.\n",

            "Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. \u201cThe problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don\u2019t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.\u201d Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks.",

There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan\u2019s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters from China\u2019s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable.",

Taiwan\u2019s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978.

As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change. Voters added to the confusion in 2021 when they opposed the completion of the two uncommissioned plants.",
            "On the 13th floor of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei, the deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s energy administration, Stephen Wu, chose his words carefully. \u201cThere is a debate going on in our parliament,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the public has demanded a reduction of nuclear power and also a reduction in carbon emissions.

            "There is a further security question to add to Taiwan\u2019s complex challenges. The island\u2019s circumstances are unique: It is a functioning democracy, a technological powerhouse, and a de facto independent country that China regards as a breakaway province to be recovered \u2014 if necessary, by force. The fact that its technology industry is essential for global production of everything from electric vehicles to ballistic missiles has counted as a security plus for Taiwan in its increasingly tense stand-off with China. It is not in the interest of China or the United States to see semiconductor manufacturers damaged or destroyed. Such companies, in security jargon, are collectively labelled Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a shield the government is keen to maintain. That the sector depends inescapably on Taiwan\u2019s energy security renders the search for a solution all the more urgent."

Plankton are at the base of the ocean food chain, feeding fish that feed billions of people. They are responsible for half of the world\u2019s oxygen supply and half of our planet\u2019s annual carbon sink. Miniscule but powerful, their presence can help or hinder ecosystems \u2014 by soaking up greenhouse gas, for example, or by spewing toxins. Where plankton live, how many there are, when they bloom and which species dominate each play a huge role in this delicate balance. And our changing climate is spurring a sea change in all of it.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re headed into an ocean and, for that matter, a world that we\u2019re not going to recognize because it\u2019s changing so fundamentally,\u201d says David Hutchins, a marine microbiologist at the University of Southern California, who has charted plankton\u2019s future.\n",
            "Climate change is hitting our oceans hard, making them warmer and more acidic, while radically altering currents. The outlook for plankton is mixed. Some studies report overall plankton numbers dropping, while others show them rising in some major ocean basins. As the planet warms, the diversity of the menagerie in many spots is increasing, says Clare Ostle, a marine biogeochemist at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. But certain species are losing out, she adds, including big juicy plankton thought to be important for food webs and carbon sequestration. And, in the long term, plankton numbers may plummet as climate change starves them of nutrients.\n",
            "BQScientists are shocked by the knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says one expert.",
            "Scientists are now struggling to work out what the net effect will be. They have some new technologies at their disposal, including a new NASA satellite called PACE \u2014 for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem \u2014 launched this February. And some old ones, including a decades-old program that painstakingly trawls the ocean with filters to scoop up tiny creatures and count them by hand. Yet scientists say they are shocked by the size of our knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "The Ocean Stewardship Coalition this month released a \u201cplankton manifesto\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, highlighting how important plankton are alongside how little we know about them. \u201cThe planetary importance of plankton remains largely ignored,\u201d the group writes, alongside a plea for more research, education, and discussion in international treaties about plankton\u2019s plight.\n",
            "The word \u201cplankton,\u201d from the Greek for \u201cwanderer,\u201d is a catchall for the host of tiny creatures that live in fresh or salty water and drift where the currents take them. That includes plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and things that blur the lines between categories in a way that land-dwelling organisms typically don\u2019t. There are phytoplankton that feed on sunlight and CO2, including glassy diatoms, dinoflagellates with whip-like tendrils, and spherical coccolithophores that are struggling against ocean acidification to build hard calcite shells. Others are zooplankton \u2014 tiny animals including shelled foraminifera, along with fish larvae, tiny worms, and even jellyfish. Some have a lifespan of just days; others, years.",

            "Temperature has a huge impact on plankton, says Fabio Benedetti, an ecological data analyst at the University of Bern. His modelling, in agreement with other work, predicts that as waters warm, plankton will move polewards at a rate of about 21 miles per decade. \u201cSome changes will be massive, like in the Arctic, where entire communities will be replaced by something new,\u201d he says. Phytoplankton seem better able to cope with gradual warming than zooplankton, Benedetti says, so their habitat range and diversity looks set to increase in most regions. But that\u2019s not necessarily good news: the most productive ocean regions, counterintuitively, have low diversity, Benedetti notes. And more diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher numbers of plankton overall.",
            "In the long term, researchers fear an overall decline in plankton numbers thanks to a dwindling supply of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and iron. Plankton typically rely on nutrients that have been mixed from the ocean bottom up to the surface. But melting polar ice and changing ocean currents are now increasing the density difference between top, fresh waters and deeper, saltier waters, making these layers ever-less-likely to mix. This increased \u201cstratification,\u201d as it is called, is expected to starve ever-more regions of the ocean. While some coastal regions are drowning in too much nitrogen, which runs off agricultural fields, much of the open ocean might become \u201cmore desert-like,\u201d says Hutchins.\n",
            "BQScientists have investigated dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. ",
            "A factor working against this trend is pollution from both the burning of fossil fuels and from wildfires, which can carry nutrients far out into ocean waters. The wildly destructive Australian wildfire season of 2019-2020, for example, poured so much nutritional iron into the water that phytoplankton concentrations doubled between New Zealand and South America, creating an algae bloom bigger than Australia that lasted for months. The biggest surprise was how long the blooms lasted, says Jakob Weis at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, who studied the phenomenon. The amount of carbon soaked up by those organisms is thought to have roughly matched the carbon spewed by the fires \u2014 a helpful factor in the context of climate change. \u201cWe intentionally refrained from framing the blooms as \u2018good news,\u2019 given the devastating impact the wildfires had on the Australian public, wildlife, terrestrial ecosystems, and climate,\u201d says Weis. But the plankton, at least, were \u201chappy.\u201d",
            "Such nutrient influxes could be a big deal, says Hutchins, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where waters are particularly starved of iron. But the long-term impacts are entirely unclear. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s going to balance out some of what\u2019s not mixing up from below, or if it\u2019s going to select for different communities, different species, because it\u2019s chemically different [food],\u201d says Hutchins. Such blooms won\u2019t make a big dent in the big-picture fight against global warming, adds Ostle. \u201cWe\u2019ve burned thousands of years of deposits of oil and gas. The phytoplankton blooms aren\u2019t going to be able to cut it.\u201d\n",

            "Since the 1990s, some small-scale experiments have investigated the idea of intentionally dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. But early tests suggested that such a geoengineering scheme might not be very effective at burying carbon in the seabed for the longterm, while being expensive and difficult to carry out \u2014 not to mention the possibly huge, unknown consequences for ocean life. There have been international moratoria against large-scale commercial fertilization efforts since 2008, but research into the idea continues. Just last month, Ken Buesseler at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and colleagues laid out a research agenda for how to best assess this strategy\u2019s possible risks and benefits. \u201cYou learn a lot from these experiments,\u201d says Benedetti, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t see this as a long-term solution.\u201d",
            "In the face of so much uncertainty, it\u2019s vital for researchers to get on-the-ground data about how plankton are faring. The longest-running program to do this is the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, an effort that has been attaching collection devices onto ocean-crossing ships since the 1930s. The technique is simple: Plankton get scooped out of surface waters and squashed onto a filter like bugs on a car windscreen. The filter rolls up as the ship moves along, creating a scroll-like record of plankton roadkill from across the ship\u2019s track. Those filters are delivered to a lab where they are unspooled and the plankton peered at through a microscope. About a dozen workers at the Marine Biological Association, the effort\u2019s headquarters, have been trained to identify more than 600 different types of tiny creature \u2014 a task they are now trying to bolster with artificial intelligence algorithms.\n",
            "BQIn the Atlantic around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining by around 10 percent per decade. ",
            "The vast majority of the CPR\u2019s data comes from the North Atlantic \u2014 a well-travelled region that happens to play an oversized role in global carbon uptake. Ostle, who heads up the Pacific Branch of the CPR, says the data here shows plankton biomass increasing near the pole and decreasing closer to the tropics, as expected.",
            "Most of the increase is, interestingly, diatoms, says Ostle \u2014 large, round phytoplankton that form juicy food balls for fish and which tend to sink quickly, making them good carbon storage bombs. \u201cIt was a surprise to see this,\u201d says Ostle. It\u2019s an important shift: \u201cDiatoms are really the engines of carbon fixation,\u201d says Hutchins, who estimates they are responsible for about half of phytoplanktons\u2019 total carbon uptake.\n",
            "Ostle suspects the explanation behind the unexpected North Atlantic diatom boom lies with sunlight. The increased ocean stratification that can stop nutrients from mixing upwards has also managed to trap diatoms in surface waters that are bathed in more light; they stay in the growing zone for longer. Eventually, says Ostle, the food disadvantage of increased stratification will likely outweigh the light advantage. But when and how remains uncertain.",

            "The story varies from region to region. In the northeast Atlantic, around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining at rates of around 10 percent per decade. Some researchers have even suggested that the infamous North Sea cod crash in the 1990s, usually attributed to overfishing, was exacerbated by a plankton deficit. In the Arctic Ocean, though, plankton numbers have blossomed, with productivity increasing by more than half between 1998 and 2018, thanks not just to more open water from melting ice but also to increased nutrients, possibly introduced to the Arctic by storms and shifting currents.",
            "There\u2019s less data in the North Pacific and in the subtropics, but both are now starting to show an important shift away from large diatoms towards dinoflagellates, says Ostle. These smaller creatures are less nutritious; fish have to work harder to eat more of them. \u201cThat could have really big implications for the fisheries. We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "Dinoflagellates are also the plankton responsible for bioluminescence \u2014 and, sometimes, for generating biotoxins that lead to shellfish poisoning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting big bioluminescent blooms off of Southern California,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty if you go out for a walk on the beach at night and the waves are all lighting up, but they also have toxins,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they [dinoflagellates] are going to be one of the winners too, in in the future warmer ocean.\u201d",
            "BQIt takes decades to see long-term climate change impacts in plankton, which are so variable from year to year. ",
            "Ostle has just taken on the job of chair of the Global Alliance CPR Surveys to help create a more comprehensive global picture of how plankton is faring. But it\u2019s hard, she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have funding at the moment to maintain this thing, so we do it voluntarily.\u201d While there are a dozen regional CPR surveys around the world, there are still huge swaths of the ocean where there\u2019s no regular plankton monitoring.",

But it takes decades to see long-term climate change impacts in plankton, which are so variable from season to season and year to year.

            "Last year, researchers reported that data from NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite showed that more than half of the world\u2019s oceans have gotten greener over the past 20 years. \u201cThat was a very nonintuitive finding for a lot of the community,\u201d says Hutchins. The implications are unclear. \u201cA \u2018greening\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily imply an increase in plankton abundance or productivity,\u201d says B.B. Cael of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, who led that work. \u201cWe tried to caution against this [interpretation], but I don\u2019t think the message got across.\u201d Instead, Cael says, the color change might be due to shifts from one kind of plankton to another.",

And, she adds, the viruses that attack plankton seem to be on the rise as waters warm \u2014 another factor with as-yet unknown consequences.",
            "Thankfully, says Hutchins, plankton have proven to be pretty robust and adaptable over billions of years of Earth\u2019s history \u2014 so the oceanic food chain will persist in one form or another. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to drive ocean life to extinction,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be different dominant species \u2014 and maybe they\u2019re not going to be the ones we wish were there.\u201d",

Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs. (Freud spent the spring of 1876 in Trieste, about a hundred miles northeast of Comacchio, fruitlessly picking apart healthy eels from the Adriatic for his advisor in Vienna.)\n",
            "BQThe market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels.",
            "The eel\u2019s mysterious life cycle resists standard fisheries science. To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

            "Since management authorities cannot rely on aquaculture to meet market demand and relieve pressure on wild eel stocks, they have had to focus on more direct conservation strategies. But they are struggling to come up with solutions, since the reasons for the European eel\u2019s collapse are not straightforward. Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980. There are clearly a number of factors at play in this long decline, but the extent of each is uncertain.",
            "Overfishing, it seems, is only one piece of the puzzle, as shown by the failure of the EU\u2019s fishing regulations to produce a recovery. Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle. The recent surge of illegal trafficking of juveniles to Asia has surely put another dent in the population.",
            "\u201cPeople want to have a clear answer, but we\u2019re not able to provide it,\u201d admitted Caroline Durif, one of the current chairs of the ICES Working Group on Eels. When asked the reason for the eels\u2019 sharp decline, Willem Dekker said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Full stop. Fishing, habitat loss, pollution, all those things, nobody knows.\u201d\n",
            "BQThe mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. ",
            "In order to ban the capture of European eels, as proposed by ICES, the European Parliament would need to repeal and amend the current EU directive requiring countries to adopt measures to support the stock\u2019s recovery. This seems unlikely given that a 2023 committee vote on a resolution calling for renewed commitment to the regulation won the support of 80 percent of delegates present. \u201cThere\u2019s no will to do a ban, and also it wouldn\u2019t help,\u201d Andrew Kerr, the chair of a nonprofit coalition of conservationists, scientists, and commercial fishermen called the Sustainable Eel Group (SEG), told me over video call from his home in England. \u201cThe eel is much more complex than that, and if you stop fishing, you\u2019re not going to save the eel. What you need is a very controlled level of fishing, but we have to work on all the environmental factors.\u201d",
            "Durif acknowledges that the EU still needs some convincing from the scientific community before it will accept a zero-catch limit. \u201cThe EU is working on making a special request to ICES to see if we can measure the efficiency of the regulation, which we keep on saying we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

            "The mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",
            "Kerr has been writing to the EU for over a decade and has spoken to gathered authorities at the Hague on the problem of illegal glass eel shipments. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to make eel become an EU priority in countertrafficking,\u201d he said. In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",
            "BQIn Sweden, the threat of hydropower plants to migrating eels is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing.",
            "Eel fishermen around Europe fear their livelihoods being put on hold by a fishing ban, and they argue that the authorities should be addressing other known mortality factors. In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years. The population numbers continue to go down; soon we risk going underneath the survival threshold of the species.\u201d"

            "Here in Burnt Corn Valley, smack in the middle of the Navajo reservation\u2019s vast Black Mesa region, the hilly land both craves water and is brutalized by it. The sandy Arizona soil cracks under a punishing August sun as red-striped blister beetles search for moisture across its baked surface. Cottonwood trees and sagebrush rise from deep gullies carved by floodwaters that, during the intensifying summer monsoon, sluice off surrounding mesas and wash away fragile topsoil \u2014 reminders that with climate change, even quenching rains harbor powers of destruction.",
            "This portrait of climatic havoc belies a softer reality, though. Farming once thrived in this parched region and could once again \u2014 if the right practices are adopted. Exhibit A: The crops on Roberto Nutlouis\u2019s 12-acre Sliding Rock Farm, in his reservation hometown of Pi\u00f1on, a five-hour drive north of Phoenix. \u201cThe corn is actually pretty big and thriving,\u201d Nutlouis says. He believes \u2014 and both Western science and the lived experience of his Native elders affirm \u2014 that the traditional rock and stick structures he\u2019s built on his property, which help store water and prevent erosion, have a lot to do with it. These structures, similar to those used by Native peoples long before Europeans arrived on the continent, are not only delivering water to crops (the broader, 27,000-square-mile reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S.). They are also restoring Nutlouis\u2019s watershed and those of his neighbors, helping to sequester carbon, and reviving this high-desert ecosystem. It\u2019s all part of a bigger effort among a range of local and regional grassroots organizations to build back the reservation\u2019s fragile, depleted ecosystems and bring greater sovereignty over food, water, and health to its communities.\n",
            "BQPeople living in arid zones have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture water for crops.",
            "Din\u00e9 (the Navajo name for themselves) are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive. Depending on elevation, precipitation in Black Mesa averages 6 to 16 inches a year; recent heat extremes \u2014 the Navajo government declared a state of emergency in 2023 due to soaring temperatures \u2014mean that the scant water evaporates more quickly. Climate models predict the region will experience increasing droughts that decimate plant life, part of a growing trend of human-caused desertification across the globe, as well as higher-intensity seasonal rainfall, which can sweep away crops and roads. The ecological health of the reservation has also been weakened by deforestation from timbering operations and from overgrazing over the years.",
            "Still, this season, Nutlouis, 44, has been able to skip his usual two-hour roundtrip drive to a reliable well to haul water home for his corn. His crop is healthy and hydrated because his land still holds last winter\u2019s snowmelt. Clearly, his heavy labor over the past 20 years \u2014 during which he has built woven brush dams, gabions (wirework cages filled with rocks), earthen berms, concrete spillways and trenches, limestone aprons and walls, and stone-lined \u201cZuni bowls,\u201d which stabilize eroding streambeds \u2014 is paying off.",

            "Din\u00e9 and others living in arid zones around the world have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture and control water to grow crops and to mitigate the devastation of floods in ephemeral stream systems. Various Puebloans, including Zuni and Hohokam, used similar devices, as did the Aztecs. Arab peoples and tribes in India have incorporated stone water diversions for thousands of years. \u201c[M]ost traditional Indigenous communities are not passive observers of nature,\u201d writes Lyla June Johnston, a Din\u00e9 anthropologist and community organizer. Instead, they are \u201cinfluential facilitators of landscape scale abundance, rooted in an ethic of kinship and reverence.\u201d",
            "Time and again over the last 15 years, Laura Norman, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has seen evidence that when these structures \u2014 which Norman calls Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams, or NIDS \u2014 are placed in gullies, they slow water to mitigate erosion, collect nutrient-rich sediment and plant debris that nourish both crops and wild plants, help store carbon, improve groundwater recharge, and increase downstream water availability by as much as 28 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect that counters degradation, and you get all of these ecosystem services,\u201d she says.",
            "The structures on Nutlouis\u2019s farm are integral cogs in a larger system of floodplain farming. It works like this: Nutlouis\u2019s property lies in an alluvial fan, where mineral-rich sediments and plant waste atop mesas and other uplands wash down onto flatter ground with rainwater, snowmelt, and spring water. Across the valley, similar farms rely on this kind of system, many of which feature stone and stick constructions that Nutlouis helped build. The organic materials trapped behind the structures, says Jonathan Sandor, an emeritus agronomy professor at Iowa State University, \u201care a major input into keeping the fertility of the soils up.\u201d Such small watersheds are optimal: \u201cThese gentle slopes and small watersheds allow runoff but reduce the possibility of high runoff velocities that may damage crops,\u201d Sandor explained in a 2008 paper.",

            "Whether rock walls or ramps, hand-dug depressions in the soil, earthen walls, or branches plaited into dams, NIDS splash water over a wider area and slow its flow so it can better soak into the soil. Many trap sediments behind them, fertilizing whatever grows nearby. The stone structures create a hyperlocal cooling effect, especially when they\u2019re combined with shade-making vegetation.",
            "Here, too, smallness is a boon. \u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d Norman says. Up to five kilometers downstream from such structures, \u201cwe\u2019ve documented increased vegetation despite drought. We\u2019ve also documented [increased vegetation] up to one kilometer upstream, which indicates water availability.\u201d In this way, an alluvial farm and its NIDS can support plants both sown and wild.\n",
            "\u201cThe moisture we get from winter precipitation is really important for the corn to germinate and grow,\u201d says Nutlouis, \u201cand the monsoon rain is really important to finish our harvest of corn and squash and melons.\u201d He acknowledges that in practice this can look chaotic, with cornfields flooded up to their ears before the water trickles down to the next field.",

            "But lately, climate change has thrown extra challenges at the reservation. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious soil moisture deficit that\u2019s causing a lot of ecological shifts,\u201d Nutlouis says. Much of Black Mesa\u2019s pinyon forest, he says, has succumbed to two decades of drought. Historically, Din\u00e9 have foraged for pinyon pine nuts. They are an important component of food sovereignty on the reservation, and their loss is acutely felt.",
            "But the ecosystem services provided by Nutlouis\u2019s structures on his farm and elsewhere do seem to be meeting those climatic challenges. He\u2019s noticed small juniper trees popping up on hillsides around his property despite the dryness; A cottonwood tree towering over one cornfield is also lush and full. \u201cThe idea that Earth will restore itself with natural seed dispersal\u201d after NIDS begin to do their job \u201chas been my observation,\u201d says Norman. Or as Nutlouis puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re allowing nature to do its own thing and restore itself.\u201d",
            "Still, Nutlouis is inclined to help the process along. His nonprofit Nihikeya (loosely translated as a collective ecological footprint) collaborates with a variety of local and regional grassroots groups that work on food, water, and justice issues, like Tolani Lake Enterprises, First Nations Development Institute, and the Ten Tribes Partnership. Din\u00e9 C.A.R.E., another collaborator, is an environmental justice organization that advocates for community health and land rights across the reservation, as well as for the cleanup of coal- and uranium-polluted rivers and aquifers. \u201cWe especially want to support a lot of renewable projects through solar and wind, and we want to support agriculture too, because having a robust food system is a form of revenue for local farmers,\u201d says executive director Robyn Jackson. \u201cIt also helps with continuing our cultural traditions.\u201d",

Some of those native plants, like wolfberry, are edible, which will also help improve food sovereignty and security. \u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to continuing farming into the future,\u201d says T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed executive director Nicole Horseherder.",
            "To house accessions of pinyon and juniper, willow, wolfberry bush, three-leaf sumac, and rabbit brush, Nutlouis is building a seed bank. When put back into the landscape, these plants will help keep the ground moist and mitigate erosion.\n",
            "Nutlouis is working on his master\u2019s degree in sustainable communities at Northern Arizona University, where he studies the Western science that qualifies and quantifies the benefits of traditional practices. But he is also adamant that watershed restoration success is predicated on reforging ancestral kinship connections \u2014 that is, on returning the power to make land-use decisions to clan mothers, who were traditionally Din\u00e9 leaders in this arena. To that end, he\u2019s been meeting with neighbors in one tiny watershed of Burnt Corn Valley after another to discuss how to improve the health of their land, whether for growing corn or just ensuring roads remain intact when it rains. So far, Nutlouis has helped restore 56 fields across the valley, with more NIDS than he can count.",

My country has more than 200 million cattle, and ranching is the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, where more than 40 percent of the cattle are raised. JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company.

Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from.

So there are business reasons not to monitor the whole supply chain. We need to change the system in Brazil, to find a new way to trace the cattle moving between farms and to stop cattle laundering.

And few rivers carry a headier and more sobering brew of history \u2014 tales of human woe and triumph \u2014 than the Tigris and Euphrates, the fabled waterways that pour through the heartlands of Eurasian civilization, through the Fertile Crescent, from their chilly headwaters in the mountains of Turkey through vast watersheds in Syria, Kuwait, and Iran, to finally empty into Persian Gulf at the sweltering marshland shores of Iraq.",
            "Ten years ago, I walked with Yazar along the banks of Tigris at the antique settlement of Hasankeyf in Turkey. A local shepherd named \u00c7oban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf, once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels \u2014 a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory \u2014 were soon to be erased.",

            "About 20 million students in the United States ride to school each day on the familiar yellow bus. The vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 490,000 school buses \u2014 which comprise the nation\u2019s largest public-transportation fleet \u2014 are powered by diesel engines. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning our kids on the way to school,\u201d said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children\u2019s lungs.",
            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",
            "*Children_aboard_an_electric_school_bus_in_Chevy_Chase,_Maryland,_last_February",
            "fCChildren aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February.\nTom Brenner / AP Photo.",
            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19371586/embed",
            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

            "With a plan for green infrastructure to drain some 9,500 acres across the city, the Philadelphia Water Department was considered by many to be at the cutting edge of stormwater management \u2014 an increasingly urgent challenge for city governments amid the bigger, more frequent rainstorms now occurring as a result of climate change, especially in the northeastern United States.\n",
            "The program led Philadelphia and other U.S. cities to install nature-based solutions to absorb and filter rainfall alongside traditional \u201cgray infrastructure,\u201d such as pipes, tunnels, and pump stations. Yet while other cities, such as Milwaukee and Boston, saw green measures as complements to gray infrastructure, Philadelphia placed rain gardens and bioswales \u2014 vegetated ditches that collect stormwater \u2014 at the center of its strategy. But now, critics say, these innovations are proving inadequate at handling the increase in extreme rainfall events. In fact, the amount of overflow from pipes that combine stormwater with raw sewage has actually increased since the Green Cities program began.\n",

But its storage tunnels and tanks have done the most to reduce combined sewer overflows into Lake Michigan and local rivers, said Kevin Shafer, the district\u2019s executive director. He estimated that the system\u2019s gray infrastructure can currently handle two and a half to three inches of rain at a time, while green measures can absorb only about half an inch.",

            "Boston, too, has emphasized gray infrastructure in its efforts to upgrade stormwater management. The city is operating under a long-term control plan \u2014 a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be \u201cfishable and swimmable.\u201d To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",

In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan.",
            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn\u2019t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.\u201d\n",
            "In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050\u2019s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That\u2019s above the watershed\u2019s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet.\n",

When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",

            "In late July, the union\u2019s African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights ruled, after nine years of deliberation, that the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should hand back parts of the giant Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the forested east of the country to its ancestral owners, the Batwa people. \n",
            "Such a restitution would right a terrible injustice, executed in the name of conservation. In the 1970s, after the park was established, the government expelled some 6,000 Batwa without consultation from the highland region of the park and revoked their customary land rights. The exiles were left landless and without compensation. To this day, many live in roadside squatter camps, often secretly entering the park to collect firewood, hunt for food, and practice rituals. \n",

We have not seen, or yet know, of any official reactions from the government.\u201d",

But it declined to answer questions from Yale Environment 360 about whether it supports the ruling or will help to implement it.",
            "But a Batwa elder now based in Bukavu near the park, who answered on condition of anonymity, explained why the ruling was so important to the tribe. \u201cOur traditional lands in the park are numerous, because each clan has its own hills. Among these hills, there are sacred sites where we communicated with the ancestors and communed with the forest, which we consider to be the nourishing mother. These lands our are identity. To deprive us of them is to exterminate us.\u201d \n",
            "\nThe African Commission\u2019s ruling is legally significant. It finds that the DRC government has violated 11 articles on human rights in the African Charter, to which it is a signatory. These include the rights of the Batwa to life, property, natural resources, development, health, religion, and culture. And it calls on the government to adopt into law as soon as possible \u201can effective mechanism for the delimitation, demarcation and titling of the territory traditionally occupied by the Batwa and the various natural resources attached to it in accordance with their tradition,\u201d and to annul all laws \u201cprohibiting the presence of the Batwa on ancestral lands and the enjoyment of the fruits of these lands.\u201d",

            "The African Union has endorsed the commission\u2019s decision, but it is far from clear how the Congolese government will respond. According to an attorney based in Bukavu, who is part-Batwa and has been following the case closely, the government has all along attempted to thwart the commission\u2019s investigation. \u201cIt has never responded to correspondence addressed to it by the Commission, nor appeared before it, even though it is a signatory member of the African Charter.\u201d (Neither the commission nor the DRC government has responded to requests for comment.)",

",
            "The forced eviction of Indigenous people, such as the Batwa, from their ancestral lands across Africa has been widespread for decades.

The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization\u2019s work in the region.",
            "The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians \u2014 more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them.",
            "The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month \u2014 signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists \u2014 contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not \u201cdetract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d noting their \u201clands include more than one-third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes.\u201d",

            "So the ruling by the African Commission on the land rights of the Batwa in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, an epitome of attempted fortress conservation, is being seen by many as a wider adjudication.",
            "Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas. UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site and calls it \u201cone of the ecologically richest regions of Africa.\u201d",
            "But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

            "Many armed groups stayed on after the civil wars, setting up crude mining operations for coltan (used in cellphones and personal computers), cassiterite (tin ore), and gold. Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",
            "BQ\u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that \u201cpark guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.\u201d",
            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas. The result, he says, is \u201cthousands of hectares of deforestation,\u201d visible in satellite images.",

            "Simpson accuses human rights lobbyists of having an \u201coverly idealized image of the Batwa as ecologically noble savages.\u201d Even so, he says the Batwa are minor players in a wider economy of ecological destruction. The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides \u201cideal hideouts\u201d for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is \u201cthe only feasible form of enforcement.\u201d",
            "But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",
            "\u201cDoes the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

            "Ozane: We\u2019re pushing them to speed things up. Because we don\u2019t know how this election is going to go. We\u2019re hoping people will vote on the issues that are going to save their communities. We need the Biden administration to be in office again to make sure that the policies he\u2019s enacting are turned into bedrock legislation. The state of Louisiana just had a judge try to overturn the LNG pause. The FERC approved this permit for CP2, fully knowing it can\u2019t go anywhere without its DOE permit. [With the Sierra Club and the NRDC] we\u2019re taking all the necessary steps to bring this to court and get this permit thrown out. ",
            "e360: To what extent are your activities now focused on the national level?\n",
            "Ozane: In the short term, I\u2019m focused on elections at home, in Louisiana. I am trying to make sure that people in communities that look like mine are registered to vote, are educated on the issues. On the national level, I\u2019m trying to go to states that have communities that look like mine to connect these issues so that people know these are not one-offs. Cancer Alley in Louisiana is not the only Cancer Alley in the United States. Other communities that look like mine are overrun with polluted air, polluted water. Flint, Michigan\u2019s water crisis is also happening in Sulphur, Louisiana. There\u2019s a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi. We need to start talking about how these issues are connected, how the people in these communities all look alike, and why they\u2019ve been sacrificed for so long.\n",
            "e360: Given the latest developments on CP2, how do you maintain your optimism?",
            "Ozane: Every morning when I wake up, I see my children, and they have this happiness, these smiles. And let me tell you, my children are not hidden from this. If you look back at our Climate Week post, you\u2019ll see my children on the frontlines holding banners. But the fact that they still get up every day smiling, laughing, knowing the fight ahead, it gives me hope. Because I know that if I don\u2019t live to see any of what I\u2019m fighting for come to fruition, I am raising the next generation of environmental activists, of climate activists, and the fight will continue until we win.\n",
