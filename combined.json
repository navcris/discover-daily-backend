            "For the first time, chemists have made a class of molecules previously thought too unstable to exist, and used them to generate exotic compounds1. Scientists say these notorious molecules, known as anti-Bredt olefins (ABOs), offer a new path to synthesizing challenging drug candidates.",
            "The work is \u201ca landmark contribution\u201d, says Craig Williams, a chemist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. The findings are published in Science.",
            "Organic molecules, which contain carbon, typically conform to specific shapes because of the way their atoms bond together. For instance, olefins, also called alkenes \u2014 hydrocarbons that are often used in reactions for drug development \u2014 have one or more double bonds between two carbon atoms, resulting in the atoms being arranged in one plane.",
            "The 100-year-old Bredt\u2019s rule \u2014 which was proposed in 1924 by organic chemist Julius Bredt \u2014 states that, in small molecules made up of two rings that share atoms, such as some types of alkene, double bonds between two carbon atoms cannot occur where the rings join together, called the bridgehead position. This is because the bonds would force the molecule into a tortured, strained 3D shape that makes it highly reactive and unstable, says study co-author Neil Garg, a chemist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cStill, 100 years later, people would say these types of structures are forbidden or too unstable to make,\u201d he says.",
            "Although the rule has made its way into chemistry textbooks, it hasn\u2019t stopped researchers from trying to break it. Previous research has hinted that it\u2019s possible to create ABOs that have a double carbon\u2013carbon bond at the bridgehead position2. But attempts to synthesize them in their complete form were unsuccessful because the reaction conditions were too harsh, says Garg.",
            "h2Trapping agents",
            "In the latest attempt, Garg and his colleagues treated a precursor compound with a fluoride source to kick-start a milder \u2018elimination\u2019 reaction, which removes groups of atoms from molecules. This resulted in a molecule that had the telltale ABO double-carbon bond. When the researchers added various trapping agents \u2014 chemicals that capture unstable molecules as they react \u2014 to this 3D ABO, they were able to produce several complex compounds that could be isolated. This suggests that the reactions of ABOs with different trapping agents can be leveraged to synthesize 3D molecules, which are useful for designing new drugs, says Garg.",
            "Unlike typical alkenes, ABOs are chiral compounds \u2014 molecules that don\u2019t perfectly match up with their mirror image. Garg and his colleagues synthesized and trapped an ABO that was enantioenriched, which means they produced more of one mirroring pair than the other. This finding suggests that ABOs could be used as unconventional building blocks for enantioenriched compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals.",
            "Chuang-Chuang Li, a chemist at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, says that the approach could be used to explore innovative synthesis pathways for other challenging molecules, such as the chemotherapy drug paclitexal (sold as Taxol) \u2014 a complex, multi-ringed molecule that is difficult to create in the laboratory. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable and reliable method,\u201d says Li.",
            "Garg and his team are exploring other reactions involving ABOs, and are investigating how to synthesize other molecules with seemingly impossible structures. \u201cWe can be thinking a little bit more outside of the box,\u201d he says.",

The trial was sponsored and designed by Novo Nordisk, which is based in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, and makes semaglutide, a drug sold as Ozempic for treating diabetes and Wegovy for treating obesity. Bliddal served briefly as a paid consultant to the company during trial planning.",
            "h2Spreading scourge",
            "Osteoarthritis, which causes stiff, painful joints, is among the most common conditions of ageing, and the knee is the most frequently affected joint. People who have obesity are at a relatively high risk of developing arthritic knees because their weight puts extra stress on their joints. Obesity also worsens symptoms, Callahan says. Pain from the condition can keep people from exercising, Bliddal says, making it extremely difficult for them to lose weight by lifestyle changes alone.",
            "How rival weight-loss drugs fare at treating obesity, diabetes and more",
            "The trial enrolled some 400 participants on five continents and randomly assigned them to receive weekly injections of either semaglutide or a placebo. They also received counselling on healthy eating and physical activity. When the trial began, participants had obesity, and their average score on a 100-point pain scale was 71 \u2014 high enough that walking was painful.",
            "After 68 weeks of injections, participants taking semaglutide had lost much more weight than those taking the placebo. They also reported a much bigger drop in pain score: an average of 42 points, compared with 28 points for placebo recipients. Those receiving semaglutide noticed a greater improvement in everyday functioning, such as climbing stairs, too.",
            "The improvement probably stems in part from a decreased load on the knee because of the weight loss, the authors write. But semaglutide also has anti-inflammatory effects, which might help to explain the pain relief.",
            "Despite the benefits, Bliddal is concerned about the long-term outlook for those who use semaglutide to relieve knee arthritis. \u201cDo these guys go on with semaglutide forever\u201d to manage their pain? People who stop taking the drugs generally regain the lost weight, and the medications are expensive \u2014 a month\u2019s supply can cost hundreds of US dollars.",
            "Callahan emphasizes that although the results seem \u201cvery exciting\u201d, it\u2019s important for people to supplement anti-obesity drugs with lifestyle changes for long-term weight maintenance.",

            "There are four known variants of the monkeypox virus: clades Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb (see \u2018Quick guide to the strains of monkeypox virus\u2019). Historically, clade I viruses have appeared mostly in Central Africa, and clade II viruses have cropped up in West Africa.",
            "This all changed in the mid-2010s, when a clade II strain sparked an outbreak in Nigeria. At the time, some researchers suggested that the variant might be capable of transmission through sexual contact. Their insights proved prescient: a similar clade II strain, called IIb, sparked a global outbreak of mpox in 2022 that has infected more than 90,000 people and continues today.",
            "Clade Ia: a strain that has been spreading in Central Africa since the virus was first discovered to infect humans in 1970. Most infections have been in children, and it was known to mainly transmit from animal to human \u2014 until recently.",

Modes of transmission are not fully understood; there is no documented evidence of sexual transmission, but it is likely that all forms of close contact contribute to its spread.",
            "Clade IIb: the strain responsible for the still-simmering 2022 global outbreak. Known to spread from person to person, including through sexual contact. Most affected population has been men who have sex with men.",
            "Meanwhile, clade I viruses have caused sporadic infections in people for more than 50 years \u2014 largely in rural regions of Central Africa. But in late 2023, researchers identified a rapidly growing outbreak in more densely populated, urban areas in eastern regions of the DRC that disproportionately affected sex workers, suggesting that this strain of the virus could, like IIb, spread readily between people.",
            "Genomic sequencing confirmed that the variant causing this outbreak contained several key differences from other clade I viruses, leading researchers to name it Ib. This strain has been detected in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Thailand, India, Germany and six African countries that had never reported mpox infections before. The DRC has been hit particularly hard: the country has reported nearly 36,000 suspected infections and more than 1,000 deaths from mpox in 2024.",
            "But now \u2014 about one year after researchers detected an outbreak of clade Ib in eastern DRC \u2014 clade Ia is worrying health officials, too. The strain has also been on the rise in western regions of the DRC and in Kinshasa. In particular, having both Ia and Ib circulating in the capital city threatens the 17 million people living there and raises the possibility of clade I spreading internationally, given that Kinshasa is a travel hub.",
            "h2Signs of evolution",
            "Health officials have been using genomic-sequencing tools to track the outbreak. As part of the effort, Mbala and his colleagues sequenced virus samples from infections in Kinshasa. In samples of both the clade Ia and Ib virus, they found a specific pattern of single-letter genetic mutations indicative of the ongoing battle between the human immune system and the virus \u2014 a pattern that would be unlikely to appear unless there was sustained human-to-human spread.",
            "Mpox vaccine roll-out begins in Africa: what will success look like?",

That the researchers didn\u2019t spot the pattern suggests that it might be a recent development. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pick up on strong signs of evolution\u201d in the more rural and endemic regions of the DRC, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who collaborates with Mbala and co-authored the August preprint as well as the Virological one. \u201cBut in Kinshasa, it seems that there is something unique going on.\u201d",
            "Clade Ia might also have the ability to spread through sexual contact: researchers reported the first probable case of sexually transmitted clade I mpox last year2, and another such publication is forthcoming, Kindrachuk says.",
            "Given that clade I has been circulating between animals and people in the DRC since 1970, Kindrachuk adds that it will be important to investigate why clade Ib suddenly emerged in 2023, and why Ia has caused a surge in the number of detected infections in the past two years. \u201cIs it because we\u2019re better at surveillance, or because we\u2019re more conscious of mpox at the community level? Is it because people have been moving around more after the [COVID-19] pandemic, or because there\u2019s been a greater reliance on contact with wildlife?\u201d he asks.",
            "For now, plans to roll out the continent\u2019s first doses of mpox vaccines are unlikely to change in light of these findings, says Nicaise Ndembi, a virologist at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa. Health officials have already been allocating doses to regions that have a higher number of infections, regardless of the specific strain found in the area, he says.",

After a heart attack, immune cells trigger a massive burst of inflammation in the heart, he says, and the researchers wondered whether these immune changes also occurred in the brain.",
            "The team found that, after a mouse\u2019s heart attack, immune cells called monocytes flooded its brain. These cells produced large amounts of a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which is an important regulator of inflammation and also promotes sleep.",
            "To confirm that these cells were linked to the increased sleep, researchers prevented monocytes from accumulating in the rodents\u2019 brains. As a result, \u201cthe mice no longer had this increase in slow-wave sleep after their heart attack,\u201d McAlpine says, supporting the theory that the influx of monocytes to the brain contributes to the post-heart-attack sleep boost. Similar experiments confirmed TNF\u2019s role as a messenger to sleep-inducing brain cells.",

In 2020, two US drug companies spearheaded the development of vaccines that helped to contain a pandemic. Two years later, a California start-up firm released the revolutionary artificial-intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT and a national laboratory broke a fundamental barrier in nuclear fusion.",
            "This year, the United States is on track to spend US$1 trillion on research and development (R&D), much more than any other country. And its labs are a magnet for researchers from around the globe, with workers born in other nations accounting for 43% of doctorate-holders in the US workforce in science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM).",

This has created \u201ca perception that the United States is increasingly hostile to foreigners\u201d, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) reported in August1, warning that the United States \u201ccan no longer take for granted that it will remain the destination of choice for the world\u2019s best and brightest\u201d. The academies called for a government-wide effort to attract and retain international talent and improve STEM education at home.",
            "The future of US science hinges, in no small way, on the November election. Together, the next president and Congress will play a pivotal part in setting the course for the US scientific enterprise for years to come by establishing funding plans, immigration policies and national-security measures that affect international collaboration.",

Combining government and private funding, the United States spent $923 billion in 2022 (the last year for which full numbers are available), or around 30% of global R&D spending.",
            "But as China\u2019s economy has soared, so has its R&D spending, to the equivalent of $812 billion (adjusted for purchasing power parity). On that trajectory it will draw level with the United States before 2030 (see \u2018Research funding race\u2019).",

In 2022, this time with an eye on China, Congress united to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized $280 billion to promote the domestic semiconductor industry and boost the budgets of several major research agencies.

By contrast, China is overtaking the United States in materials science, physical sciences and computer science, which are areas where US investments have fallen short.",
            "The question, come January, is whether the next president and Congress will work together to advance scientific funding commitments that both political parties have endorsed in the past.

            "Biden seeks to boost science funding \u2014 but his budget faces an ominous future",
            "When it comes to setting spending priorities, Congress often goes its own way no matter what presidents propose in their budgets. For example, although previous president Donald Trump repeatedly sought to cut science budgets, it was during his tenure that Congress broke its own self-imposed budget caps and gave science agencies a significant boost in funding alongside the increases in defence spending sought by the Trump administration, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland.",
            "Today, lawmakers are once again operating under a budget agreement that seeks to cap overall spending until 2025, which could make it difficult to increase STEM spending, but it\u2019s unclear how that discussion will play out with a new president and Congress next year.",
            "\u201cI call it the whiplash effect,\u201d says Zeitzer. Funding agencies are constantly buffeted by shifting political winds that produce big promises \u2014 and occasionally big investments \u2014 before an inevitable swing back towards austerity. Half of the time, funding agencies are operating under provisional budgets and the looming threat of a government shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re supposed to be competitive if we\u2019re facing another 20 years of this,\u201d Zeitzer says.",

            "Biden ultimately ended both policies, but many scholars say they could make a comeback if Trump prevails in November. Last month, Trump vowed to reinstate his travel ban, and Republicans who control the US House of Representatives have approved legislation that would, if enacted, essentially reinstate the China Initiative.",
            "These tensions might be taking a toll: surveys in the United States have found that many Chinese researchers worry about prejudice after the China Initiative. A study6 published this year examined the propensity of Chinese students to enrol in US PhD programmes, compared with a control group of non-Chinese students. The two were in step until 2016, but the Chinese students became 15% less likely to enrol by 2019 \u2014 and more likely to enrol in non-US English-speaking countries. (The rapid drop of enrolments during the pandemic means that the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, can\u2019t reliably be extended to later years.)",

Part of a broader trend towards increasing political polarization, these culture wars have engulfed campuses and led some lawmakers to impose limits on what university researchers can study and teach, and to curtail policies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion. The August NASEM report1 tapped into some of these sentiments, raising the fear that the United States\u2019 reputation is beginning to suffer abroad. \u201cSome of the nation\u2019s most important advantages in attracting and retaining talent are the intangibles: values, freedom, and opportunity,\u201d the report stated.",

By contrast, Trump and his appointees repeatedly undermined government scientists and agencies during his time in office, especially on issues such as climate change and public health.",

Besides Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the results of any election he doesn\u2019t win and his promises to use the powers of the federal government for political retribution, researchers fear that he just might succeed in reshaping the US government by replacing thousands of federal scientists with obedient political appointees.

Because of the way the plant reproduces, this collection of aspens is technically all one tree, supported by a single, vast root system. Pando is triploid, meaning that its cells contain three copies of each chromosome, rather than two. As a result, Pando cannot reproduce sexually and mix its DNA with that of other trees, and instead creates clones of itself.",

However, over a smaller scale of 1\u201315 metres the trend was stronger, with stems that were closer together having significantly more shared mutations. Pando covers an area of more than 40 hectares, \u201cbut it almost looks like it\u2019s a well-mixed pot of genetic information\u201d, says Ratcliff.",

            "But China\u2019s broader research-evaluation system \u2014 which places emphasis on researchers securing NSFC grants, in particular \u2014 is making the competition for limited funding particularly intense, says Tang.",
            "NSFC grants are a measure of achievement when researchers are assessed for contracts, promotions and tenure, says a researcher who requested to remain anonymous because they are worried their view might harm their chances of obtaining NSFC grants in future. Many early-career researchers view NSFC funding as opening the door to career opportunities rather than just as a vehicle to fund their projects, the researcher says. \u201cWe regard the NSFC as a bridge.\u201d",

            "The growing number of early-career researchers is set to add to funding pressures. In 2023, around 1.3 million graduate students were enrolled in universities across China, an increase of 4.8% on the previous year, according to the Ministry of Education.",
            "Another factor adding to the pressure to obtain grant funding is that many universities don\u2019t offer start-up packages to young scientists, which forces them to obtain grants from elsewhere to get up and running, adds Cao. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have money from external sources, it\u2019s very difficult to start your career,\u201d he says.",
            "One way to ease the competition and pressure on young Chinese scientists is to create a more diverse range of funding sources, says Hu. Universities and research institutions should also base their research evaluations on the outcomes of funded projects instead of the number of grants researchers win, he adds. \u201cThere has to be a change in the way these young scientists are evaluated,\u201d says Hu.",

            "Roger Sperry was a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He got curious about how the two sides of the brain interact. He focused on a thick bundle of nerve fibers that joins the two halves. It\u2019s called the corpus callosum and in people it contains more than 200 million nerve fibers.",

In this disorder, excess nerve-cell activity can overwhelm the brain. It\u2019s been described like a lightning storm inside the head. Too much nerve-cell firing can cause harmful seizures. Cutting the corpus callosum quieted them. And it didn\u2019t seem to have a big effect on normal brain function.",
            "That splitting the brain didn\u2019t seem to cause problems fascinated Sperry. To better understand why, he started working with people who had gotten their corpus callosum cut.",

When shown objects, people could draw things they saw with their left eyes but could not describe them in words.",
            "These results suggested that the ability to use and understand language is based in the left side of the brain.",
            "This finding made sense for other reasons, too. From other studies, researchers knew about two parts of the brain important for language. They are called Broca\u2019s (BRO-kuhz) area and Wernicke\u2019s (WUR-nih-keez) area. Both are usually found on the left side of the brain.",

But the idea of right- versus left-brain skills also caught people\u2019s imaginations. An article based on Sperry\u2019s work had been published in the New York Times Magazine in 1973. It took ideas from his findings and other case studies and ran with them. It claimed skills such as musical ability were controlled entirely by the right brain.",
            "In this way, important research gave way to speculation.",
            "In fact, this early research had one huge limitation: Scientists back then had no way to look inside a living brain.",
            "Now, researchers have several tools that can image the working brain. One is functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. It can track blood flow in the brain. Active brain cells need lots of oxygen, which is carried by blood. So high levels of blood flow are used to pinpoint regions where the brain is active.",
            "In 2013, researchers used MRI to scan the brains of more than 1,000 kids and young adults. They measured whether some brain functions seemed isolated to the left or right sides. And a few functions were tied more strongly to one side, these scans showed. Among them was language, which supported Sperry\u2019s findings from decades earlier. But most brain networks bounced between both hemispheres.",
            "That disproved the idea that only the right hemisphere is at work when you perform music or create art, says Diana Sarko. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true. [Activity] is very, very distributed.\u201d And, she adds,\u00a0\u201cThank goodness it is, because both sides of the brain have a lot to offer.\u201d Though not part of the MRI work, Sarko studies the brain at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.",

A neuroscientist, she works at the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cThe thinking now,\u201d she says, \u201cis that although\u00a0there may be one area largely responsible for some sort of skill, it doesn\u2019t work on its own.\u201d Brain imaging shows that \u201ceverything\u2019s interconnected.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Not only do brain areas work together, but sometimes networks also change or move. Such shifts may be seen in response to injury. And they give further evidence that many functions aren\u2019t limited to specific areas of the brain.",
            "Some functions are controlled more by regions on one side of the brain than the other. But traits like creativity and logic are far too complex to use just one brain area. In fact, any time you create a painting or solve a math problem, lots of areas on both sides of the brain team up. So the next time a quiz or a friend tells you that you\u2019re \u201cleft-brained\u201c or \u201cright-brained,\u201d remember: You have your whole brain to thank for all the amazing things you can do.",

            "A full moon could make it easy for a werewolf to spot prey. But a bright night makes it easy to be spotted, too. ",
            "As the full moon rises, a mythical werewolf howls and heads out on the hunt. But is this the best time for werewolves to find a meal? In some stories, this transformation can happen at any time of the month or even during the day. And science suggests that a careful werewolf might want to schedule their change based on their goals.\u00a0",
            "The moon affects our world in several ways. As it orbits Earth, the moon pushes and pulls at the oceans to make tides. These tides can, in turn, influence the behavior of ocean creatures. And moonlight \u2014 a reflection of the sun \u2014 can also have power over the behavior of animals both on land and in the sea.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "If a werewolf is all big, scary predator, the full moon might be a blessing. But if the animal could face predators itself, it might want to save its transformation for a much darker night.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The dark depths of an ocean or stream might not seem like the obvious place for animals affected by the moon. But \u201cit is something that we see pretty commonly among aquatic critters,\u201d says Heidi Ballew. She\u2019s a marine ecologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ballew studies the \u2018O\u2018opu nakea (Awaous stamineus), a goby native to Hawaii. The hardy little fish are born in freshwater streams in the hills. From there, a goby\u2019s life can take two very different paths depending on when it\u2019s born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When the moon is full, the sun, Earth and moon are lined up. This produces higher tides. Some gobies hatch during that full moon. The higher tides sweep their tiny bodies out to sea. When they are grown, higher tides during the new moon (when the sun, moon and Earth line up again) help them find their way back to their home streams. Special fins on their bellies, modified into suckers, help them climb waterfalls back to their birthplace. There, they mate and make more gobies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/mmwM7dwtvKA?feature=oembed",
            "Waterfall? Not a problem. Watch a goby climb up a waterfall with her mouth and her sucker-like fin.\u00a0",
            "But not all gobies go out to see the world. Gobies born during the dark of a new moon stay home and never leave the stream where they are born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Baby gobies are trying to avoid predation, Ballew says. \u201cA full moon provides a high tide. But it also produces a lot of light \u2014 even underwater.\u201d Night-hunting fish can better see tiny, defenseless gobies. So if a fish is going to stay put, hatching at the new moon is a safer bet.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The moon matters even as they grow into adults. A big, well-fed baby goby may become an adult during the full moon. But a smaller goby might become an adult at the new moon instead. The darkness hides these still-small, newly adult gobies, keeping them safe from predators. Ballew and her colleagues published their fishy findings February 26 in the journal Ecology of Freshwater Fish.\u00a0",
            "So there are pros and cons to lots of moonlight. A full moon lights up the night and makes it easy to spot dinner. But if a werewolf is as likely to become prey as it is to go hunting, a new moon might help it hide.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The bright night of a full moon also presents Australian mammals with a problem, says Euan Ritchie. He\u2019s a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In one study, Ritchie and his colleagues took photos of animals in southeastern Australia at different phases of the moon. Prey species such as possums and rabbit-sized bandicoots were more active when nights were cloudy. The extra darkness provided cover to hide from predators.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But predators such as quolls were also more active when it was darker \u2014 when the moon was new or half. Each species was trying to find a balance between getting more food and becoming someone else\u2019s dinner.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "\u201cPredators often use ambush to capture their prey,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cThe lighter it is, the harder it might be [for predators] to avoid detection.\u201d While the prey might be able to spot a predator more easily, they, too, may be more detectable. \u201cThey [might] be more hesitant to be active, especially in areas without much cover to retreat to.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ritchie and his colleagues published their findings in 2020 in the journal Australian Mammalogy.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Werewolves also need to find that balance between predator and prey. If a werewolf wanted to hunt as much as possible, \u201cthey would hunt humans by day and night,\u201d Ritchie says. But being a werewolf isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cMany prey, including humans, are often far from harmless.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In that case, Ballew says, a werewolf might be advised to vary its strategy. A big, strong werewolf could find good hunting during the full moon. But if a werewolf is small, young, or weak? \u201cMaybe you would want to utilize the new moon so that your predators are less likely to find you.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson a werewolf could learn from the gobies that stayed home.\u00a0\u00a0"

Craters are what make our moon look like Swiss cheese. Each round hole is the place where a meteorite\u00a0impacted, or hit, the surface of the moon, so craters are often called\u00a0impact craters. Often, the meteorite that creates a crater explodes on impact, so the crater is an empty reminder of the collision.",
            "There are\u00a0meteoroids\u00a0traveling around throughout space, and all of the moons and planets in our solar system have been impacted by meteorites since its formation. (Note: they are called meteoroids when they\u2019re still in space, and meteorites when they land on a planet or moon.)",
            "On Earth, we only see a few impact craters, for a couple of different reasons. First, most meteoroids never reach the Earth\u2019s surface because they burn up in the atmosphere. This is what we are seeing when we watch a\u00a0shooting star\u00a0during a\u00a0meteor shower\u00a0(meteor\u00a0refers to the visible streak of light). Second, impact craters from meteorites can be changed by geological forces (like earthquakes and continental movements) or eroded away by atmospheric forces (like wind or rain). There is no atmosphere on the moon, which means that falling meteoroids do not burn up and there is no weather to erode away the craters. In fact, the footprints of the astronauts who landed on the moon over 50 years ago are still there!",

            "Where can you find impact craters on Earth? There are only about 170 confirmed impact craters on Earth. Not all of them are obvious because most are eroded, covered by sediment or under water. Each crater has to be identified using several different kinds of clues. First, geological clues are found by looking for pieces of the exploded, iron-rich meteorite or for glass that formed during the impact. Satellite imaging can be used to visualize crater formations that are beneath the Earth\u2019s surface or a body of water. Finally, chemical evidence is used to date the crater and find traces of elements that are more common in space than on our planet.",
            "By piecing together this evidence, scientists can study craters on Earth and link them to different periods of Earth\u2019s history. This involves many different types of scientists, including astronomers, geologists, chemists, paleontologists and meteorologists (who actually study weather, not meteorites). This has led to an interesting hypothesis being proposed about the formation of a sea, the extinction of the dinosaurs and even the origins of life!",

To test this, you will use different-sized, nearly spherical objects as your \u201cmeteorites,\u201d like the objects shown in Figure 2. What types of clues will you look for in your investigation? How will studying an impact crater give you information about the collision, even if the meteorite is no longer there? Are there other clues of a meteorite impact that are important?",

But some insect proteins may be healthier for us than the meat of larger animals, such as beef, fish or chicken. Farming insects is also better for the planet than other types of livestock. It uses less land, water and energy. And it produces fewer greenhouse gases, such as methane.",

Insect larvae contain some chitin, too. This sugar-based polymer binds to proteins and makes them hard to digest. So diners who eat whole insects won\u2019t get full nutritional benefit from their proteins.",
            "Treatment can separate out that chitin. Now, people can better absorb the protein.",
            "But there\u2019s still the yuck factor. Eating insects is normal in some parts of the world. Many of us don\u2019t want to eat insects, however \u2014 no matter how nutritious they may be. And it\u2019s hard to ignore that you\u2019re eating insects if you crunch on their legs or wings.

Then, they mixed in one of three solutions to dissolve the proteins out of the defatted worms. One solution was sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Another contained a salt. The third contained enzymes. Lastly, they freeze-dried the mix to remove water. The leftover material was crushed into a powder.",

This squeezed out any liquids. It\u2019s similar to how olive oil is extracted from whole olives. Next, the team strained the liquid and freeze-dried it (to remove water).

And wild hamsters seem to develop a taste for their children when they lack key nutrients in their diets. On the flip side, some mamma insects and spiders allow their babies to devour them. That allows the newborns to start off life with a feast.",
            "There are also animals that eat their peers. Some amphibians, for instance, have two larval forms. One is normal. The other is a cannibal form. The cannibal larvae have bigger mouths and sharper teeth \u2014 the better for scarfing down other larvae with. And that\u2019s not even the most extreme form of peer-on-peer cannibalism. Some shark embryos eat their brothers and sisters while still in their mother\u2019s womb. Only the strongest embryo survives to be born.",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",

Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",

But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",

            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",

            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",

The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",

            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",
            "*a_girl_explaining_something_to_her_mom",
            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",

            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

            "Millions of Americans will be lining up to vote on November 8. Millions will also stay home. But scientists have insight into how to convince people to vote.",
            "Every two years, on the first Tuesday (after a Monday) in November, Americans should head to the polls to take part in a national election. Some important elections may take part in the off-years as well. But not everyone who is eligible to vote will do so. In fact, millions of people won\u2019t. And that\u2019s a problem because people who don\u2019t vote lose out on a prime chance to register their views. Also, voting isn\u2019t just important. It is a privilege and a right that many people throughout the world lack.",
            "One person\u2019s vote probably won\u2019t change course of an election. But a few thousand votes \u2014 or even a few hundred \u2014 certainly can. Consider, for instance, the famous election between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000. Once the polling was over, Florida had to recount its votes. In the end, Bush won by 537 votes. That difference decided who became president of the United States.",
            "Even in polling for local offices \u2014 such as a school board \u2014 the result of a vote can change everything from what schools neighborhood children will attend to whether their textbooks will cover evolution.",
            "There are many reasons why people don\u2019t vote.\u00a0And to counter the anger, apathy, fatigue and other factors that deter many folks from voting, organizations big and small mount campaigns urging people to go to the polls. Facebook users may plead with their friends. Politicians may hire phone banks to call thousands of people in states where a race appears to be very competitive. Celebrities may beg over YouTube. Does any of this really work?",
            "Political scientists have studied ways to change people\u2019s voting behavior. These four methods seem to stand out in terms of being most effective.",
            "1) Educate early and well\u00a0\u00a0 Messages that people receive early in life have a strong impact on whether people vote, notes Donald Green. He\u2019s a political scientist at Columbia University in New York City. Parents and teachers should therefore let kids know \u201cvoting is important,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes you a functioning adult.\u201d Teachers might help deliver this message in classes where students learn about how their country and government functions. That happened to me in high school when my own teacher one day begged me and my classmates to vote.",
            "People with college degrees are also more likely to vote. Perhaps society should make it easier for people to afford college. \u201cA person who gets a college education ends up in a different life circumstance,\u201d explains Barry Burden. He\u2019s a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. College graduates tend to associate more with people who vote \u2014 and then they vote, too. They also stand to earn more (paying more taxes), data have shown. So a more educated population should be a win-win for society.",
            "2) Peer pressure\u00a0 \u00a0A healthy dose of name and shame can have a big effect on Election Day. Green and his colleagues demonstrated this in a study published in 2008 in American Political Science Review. They applied a little social pressure to voters.",
            "Right before Michigan\u2019s 2006 Republican primary, the researchers selected a group of 180,000 potential voters. They mailed about 20,000 voters a letter asking them to do their \u201ccivic duty\u201d and vote. They mailed another 20,000 a different letter. It asked them to do their civic duty, but added that they were being studied \u2014 and that their votes were a matter of public record. (In some states, such as Michigan, voting records are publicly available after an election.) A third group got the same messages as the second group. But they also got a note that showed them their previous voting record, and the previous voting records of the people in their household. A fourth group got the same information as the third group, as well as being shown the publicly available voting records of their neighbors. The last 99,000 people or so were a control \u2014 they got no mailings at all.",
            "*350_inline_Voting2pngpng",
            "fCWhen many Americans vote on November 8, they will go into small, curtained stalls to keep their choices private.",
            "After all the votes were counted, the scientists saw a 1.8 percentage point increase in turnout by people who had been reminded to vote over those who did not get such a mailing. For the group told their votes were a matter of public record, there was a 2.5 percentage point increase. But the biggest increase were among those shown voting records. Turnout increased by 4.9 percentage points among people shown their previous voting records. And if voters were also shown their neighbors voting records, turnout at the polls rose a whopping 8.1 percentage points.",
            "Although shaming may get out the vote, Green cautions that it likely also burns bridges. \u201cI think it produces backlash,\u201d he says. In the 2008 study, many of the people who received the letter that showed the voting records of their neighbors called the number on the mailing and asked to be left alone.",
            "Peer pressure doesn\u2019t always have to be mean, though. Asking friends directly to pledge to vote \u2014 and then making sure they do \u2014 might be effective, Green says. The most effective thing to do, he says, may be to say to a close friend or coworker, \u201clet\u2019s walk to the polls together.\u201d",
            "3) Healthy competition\u00a0 \u201cPeople are going to participate when they think they are going to make a difference,\u201d says Eyal Winter. An economist, he works at the University of Leicester in England and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He notes that there is higher voter turnout when an election is close and there\u2019s no telling who might win. Winter compares elections to football or baseball games. When two close rivals face off, their competitions will draw much bigger crowds than when one team is sure to roll right over another. \u00a0",
            "To find out whether a close election might make more people vote than a race where one politician is far behind another, Winter and his colleague looked at U.S. elections for state governors from 1990 to 2005. When surveys before the election showed that results were likely to be very close, voter turnout increased. Why? People now felt their vote might make a bigger difference.",
            "More voters also turned out for the side with the slight majority in the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer to support your team when you\u2019re expected to win,\u201d Winter explains. He and his colleague Esteban Klor \u2014 a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem \u2014 published their findings in 2006 on the Social Science Research Network.",
            "4) The personal touch\u00a0\u00a0 Hundreds of studies have been done on what gets people to vote. Some of the studies might be partisan \u2014 focusing on people who support a particular party. Others might focus on both major parties or even on people in general. Such research has probed everything from the how much money to spend on voicemail messages to crafting the ideal subject line for an email.",
            "Many of these ideas are described in Get out the Vote: How to increase voter turnout. This book was written by Green and his colleague Alan Gerber of Yale University in New Haven, Conn. The 2015 version of the book includes chapters on social media, mailing letters to people\u2019s houses and putting signs along highways. Letters and signs, computerized phone calls and Facebook posts all seem to help a little. But the most effective methods employ face-to-face and one-on-one discussions of the candidates, Green says. For politicians this means walking door to door (or having volunteers do it).",
            "But maybe someone just wants to get a sister or friend to vote. In that case, Green says the most effective message might be to convey your own enthusiasm for the candidates, the issues and how much you\u2019d like to see that person vote.",
            "Appealing directly to friends and family might help them get to the polls on Election Day. But keep in mind that everyone has their own opinions on the candidates. Even if you get your friends and family members to vote, they might not vote the way you\u2019d like them to."

In the old days, he says, \u201cyou could not have a person sitting in an attic and generating conspiracy theories at a mass scale.\u201d Then along came the internet, and more recently social media. Now, peddling lies is truly easy \u2014 especially as the internet can essentially hide who is behind a post. Consider that group of teens in the European nation of Macedonia, two years ago. They raked in huge sums of cash by writing popular fake news on topics that were popular during the U.S. presidential election. Readers thought those posts had been written by true journalists.",

            "Waviness in the high-speed flow of the jet stream (shown) can cause fingers of stratospheric air to punch down and curl into the troposphere below. This mixing of atmospheric layers spurs chemical reactions that cause new aerosol particles to form.",
            "Clouds form when water molecules in the air stick to certain tiny particles \u2014 think of them as seeds. Scientists have now discovered an unexpected source of those seeds.",
            "When two layers of Earth\u2019s atmosphere overlap, chemicals in each layer can mix and react. These reactions can form the tiny new particles around which clouds begin to form. In fact, this may be the most common way that the seeds for clouds form. That\u2019s the finding of a study in the July 12 Science.",
            "Earth\u2019s atmosphere has five layers. We live in the troposphere. It\u2019s the lowest one. It also has the densest air. The stratosphere, right above it, has thinner air. It also contains different chemicals than those in our layer.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists had thought most new atmospheric particles form in the upper troposphere. Clouds would rise into this region and then shed rain. That rain would carry away the existing particles. Gases left behind would have almost no solid particles left to glom onto. So new clouds would not develop until new particles formed.",
            "In the new study, researchers looked at data collected during a series of flights by NASA aircraft. Many particles are formed when the stratosphere dips a toe into the upper troposphere, they found. They call this stratospheric air intrusion. It\u2019s caused by the jet stream, a fast-moving current of air.",
            "And it just might be the most productive place on Earth for cloud-forming particles, the new data suggest.",
            "The stratosphere is cold and enriched with a type of oxygen known as ozone. The troposphere is warmer. It\u2019s moister and contains a variety of other gases. Sunlight and water cause molecules in these air masses to react chemically. This can generate different types of tiny particles, explains study coauthor Jian Wang. He\u2019s an aerosol scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",

These gas molecules eagerly react with other gases high above Earth. So there are probably many different chemical reactions going on up there. And they\u2019ll produce a variety of new gases and particles. Exactly which and how many particles are being formed is a question for future research, Wang says.",

            "Waviness of the jet stream can lead the stratosphere \u2014 rich in ozone (O3) \u2014 to dip into the troposphere, which is rich in water (H2O). The troposphere also contains molecules such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), emitted by fossil fuels and volcanoes. Sunlight and water vapor cause these chemicals to react in ways that generate chemicals such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a building block of tiny aerosol particles. Previous research had suggested that the main way new particles formed were instead \u201ccloud outflows\u201d \u2014 regions where high troposphere clouds break up.",
            "Stratospheric intrusions may be an especially big source of such new particles in Earth\u2019s midlatitudes. Those are regions such as the continental United States \u2014 ones that are not close to either the poles or the Equator.",
            "Climate change is expected to speed up stratospheric circulation. In the future, that could cause the stratosphere to poke into the troposphere more frequently. If it does, stratospheric intrusion may become even more important in forming new particles, Wang says.",
            "This newly reported role for jet streams in particle formation has been long overlooked, says Yuanlong Huang. He did not take part in the new study. An atmospheric aerosol chemist, Huang works at the Eastern Institute for Advanced Study. It\u2019s in Ningbo, China.",
            "Right now, he notes, stratospheric intrusion is not yet accounted for in computer models that simulate weather and climate. In other words, these particles may play a bigger role than scientists once thought in how incoming sunlight is distributed on Earth. That includes how much of the sun\u2019s rays reach the planet\u2019s surface. It also includes how much of the sun\u2019s energy aerosols and clouds absorb high in the atmosphere."

They\u2019ve been storing these cells, seeds and other materials in protected facilities across the globe. But climate change, environmental disasters and wars can threaten these modern Noah\u2019s Arks. Now, some researchers have proposed an out-of-this-world solution: Build one of these arks on the moon.",

They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",

            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",

            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",

It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes.

This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",

The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",

Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",

            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",

            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",

(Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",

The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch. Technically, the\u00a0frequency\u00a0of a wave describes how many cycles of the wave happen during a certain amount of time. This is measured in\u00a0hertz, or cycles per second. On average, the frequency range for human hearing is from 20\u00a0hertz at the low end to 20,000\u00a0hertz at the high end. Figure 2 shows examples of sound waves of two different frequencies. The\u00a0period\u00a0in the wave is the time that it takes for a single cycle of the wave to pass.

            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",

            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",

This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."

We have gone from about 6 billion hectares of forest to 4 billion. We have lost a third of the planet\u2019s forests in the last 10,000 years. About 50 percent of that loss has been just in the last 100 years or so. That\u2019s how much it\u2019s sped up since the Industrial Revolution. But the nature of forests is changing too.

Another view is we need to restore the functions and the processes of ecosystems and the biodiversity they support, not necessarily this ideal picture of what it was a few thousand years ago. I would like to see us recognize that humans are part of the ecosystem and that it\u2019s okay that we\u2019re altering the land: Indigenous peoples have been changing ecosystems for tens of thousands of years.\n",

            "In the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton, meteorologists have faced an unprecedented wave of threats and harassment, according to James Marshall Shepherd, a former NASA weather scientist who is currently director of the University of Georgia\u2019s atmospheric sciences program. Some have received messages stating that scientists should be killed; others have been cursed and told to shut up. Social media posts have also targeted FEMA workers, suggesting they should be beaten, arrested, shot, or hung on sight.",

            "About 18 months ago, climate scientists began to notice something strange. In March of 2023, global sea surface temperatures started to rise. In a warming world, the seas would be expected to grow hotter, but the rise, which came at a time when the Pacific Ocean was in the neutral phase of the weather pattern known as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, was unusually steep. In April, 2023, sea surface temperatures set a new record. They did so again in May.\n",
            "As the months went on, the weirdness continued. In the summer of 2023, the world entered an El Ni\u00f1o, the warm phase of ENSO. El Ni\u00f1os typically bring higher temperatures, but in the second half of 2023, both sea surface and air temperatures increased so much that scientists were stunned. One called the figures \u201cabsolutely gobsmackingly bananas.\u201d\n",
            "In an essay that appeared in Nature this past March, NASA\u2019s chief climate scientist, Gavin Schmidt said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists\u2019 predictive capabilities more than 2023 has.\u201d\n",
            "Officially, the El Ni\u00f1o ended in May 2024. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high. This year they are expected to set yet another record.",

The first is a set of rules that reduced the sulfur content of the fuel used in super tankers. Since sulfur dioxide pollution reflects sunlight, this change, while good for public health, could have led to increased ocean heating. ",
            "A second potential contributor is an unusual eruption that occurred in January 2022. Normally, volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide and so produce temporary cooling. But the eruption of Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2018apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific, sent water vapor shooting into the stratosphere, which could have had a warming effect.",
            "Yet another possible contributor is the solar cycle. The sun is currently at, or near, a peak of activity, and this, too, could be boosting temperatures.",
            "At this point, though, Schmidt says, none of these developments \u2014 or even a combination of all of them \u2014 seems sufficient to explain the heat. This, in turn, raises several other possibilities. The recent temperature run-up could be the result of some development that\u2019s yet to be identified. Or it could mean the climate system is more unpredictable than was thought. Alternatively, it could indicate that something is missing from climate models, or that amplifying feedbacks are kicking in sooner than the models had predicted.\n",

We expected that 2023 would be another warm year because all of the years are warm now, but it probably wasn\u2019t going to be a record-warm year. So when the records started to be broken, first in the North Atlantic in March and April, June, and then the global mean in June, and then throughout the rest of the year, and then absolutely ridiculously large record-breaking events in the fall \u2014 August, September, October, November \u2014 people started using adjectives that scientists don\u2019t generally tend to use.",
            "At the end of 2023, we summed it up: It was a record warm year and it was a record-breaking size of the record. Our eyebrows at this point were rolling over the top of our heads. It was clear that the predictions that people had made at the beginning of year were all wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter what the method was, they were all wrong, and they were all wrong by about 0.2 degrees Celsius. Now that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a big deal. ",

And maybe we\u2019ll get some more analyses of the internal variability. Some of that has happened, but not in a coordinated way. And it\u2019s still pretty much, I would say, amateur hour in terms of assessing what actually happened in 2023.",

It put a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is normally super dry. That was a very new thing, and people were saying, well, maybe that\u2019s contributing.",
            "People were also talking about unusual behavior of the Saharan dust or the wind pattern in the North Atlantic. People were talking about long-term, ongoing changes in how much pollution is coming from China and India. Maybe those things are changing faster than we anticipated. The pollution in the air is a cooling factor, and so if you take it away, then that\u2019s a warming factor.",
            "The science that\u2019s been done has not been equally spread amongst all of those things. A lot of people have looked at the impact of the marine shipping regulation change. If you take that and you put it into some climate model and you estimate the temperature change, right now you\u2019d expect about 0.05 of a degree, 0.08 of a degree [of warming per year], and then building over a decade to about 0.1 degree. So that seems like it helps, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s sufficient. And the first paper that came out about the volcano, they said, no, no, the normal cooling volcanic pollution is still bigger than the warming water vapor component. So now I have more warming to explain and less things to explain it.\n",

Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off. And you could think of things being more off in multiple ways because the system is changing in a way where what happened in the past is no longer a good guide to what\u2019s going to happen in the future.

            "Here in Burnt Corn Valley, smack in the middle of the Navajo reservation\u2019s vast Black Mesa region, the hilly land both craves water and is brutalized by it. The sandy Arizona soil cracks under a punishing August sun as red-striped blister beetles search for moisture across its baked surface. Cottonwood trees and sagebrush rise from deep gullies carved by floodwaters that, during the intensifying summer monsoon, sluice off surrounding mesas and wash away fragile topsoil \u2014 reminders that with climate change, even quenching rains harbor powers of destruction.",
            "This portrait of climatic havoc belies a softer reality, though. Farming once thrived in this parched region and could once again \u2014 if the right practices are adopted. Exhibit A: The crops on Roberto Nutlouis\u2019s 12-acre Sliding Rock Farm, in his reservation hometown of Pi\u00f1on, a five-hour drive north of Phoenix. \u201cThe corn is actually pretty big and thriving,\u201d Nutlouis says. He believes \u2014 and both Western science and the lived experience of his Native elders affirm \u2014 that the traditional rock and stick structures he\u2019s built on his property, which help store water and prevent erosion, have a lot to do with it. These structures, similar to those used by Native peoples long before Europeans arrived on the continent, are not only delivering water to crops (the broader, 27,000-square-mile reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S.). They are also restoring Nutlouis\u2019s watershed and those of his neighbors, helping to sequester carbon, and reviving this high-desert ecosystem. It\u2019s all part of a bigger effort among a range of local and regional grassroots organizations to build back the reservation\u2019s fragile, depleted ecosystems and bring greater sovereignty over food, water, and health to its communities.\n",
            "BQPeople living in arid zones have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture water for crops.",
            "Din\u00e9 (the Navajo name for themselves) are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive. Depending on elevation, precipitation in Black Mesa averages 6 to 16 inches a year; recent heat extremes \u2014 the Navajo government declared a state of emergency in 2023 due to soaring temperatures \u2014mean that the scant water evaporates more quickly. Climate models predict the region will experience increasing droughts that decimate plant life, part of a growing trend of human-caused desertification across the globe, as well as higher-intensity seasonal rainfall, which can sweep away crops and roads. The ecological health of the reservation has also been weakened by deforestation from timbering operations and from overgrazing over the years.",
            "Still, this season, Nutlouis, 44, has been able to skip his usual two-hour roundtrip drive to a reliable well to haul water home for his corn. His crop is healthy and hydrated because his land still holds last winter\u2019s snowmelt. Clearly, his heavy labor over the past 20 years \u2014 during which he has built woven brush dams, gabions (wirework cages filled with rocks), earthen berms, concrete spillways and trenches, limestone aprons and walls, and stone-lined \u201cZuni bowls,\u201d which stabilize eroding streambeds \u2014 is paying off.",

            "Din\u00e9 and others living in arid zones around the world have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture and control water to grow crops and to mitigate the devastation of floods in ephemeral stream systems. Various Puebloans, including Zuni and Hohokam, used similar devices, as did the Aztecs. Arab peoples and tribes in India have incorporated stone water diversions for thousands of years. \u201c[M]ost traditional Indigenous communities are not passive observers of nature,\u201d writes Lyla June Johnston, a Din\u00e9 anthropologist and community organizer. Instead, they are \u201cinfluential facilitators of landscape scale abundance, rooted in an ethic of kinship and reverence.\u201d",
            "Time and again over the last 15 years, Laura Norman, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has seen evidence that when these structures \u2014 which Norman calls Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams, or NIDS \u2014 are placed in gullies, they slow water to mitigate erosion, collect nutrient-rich sediment and plant debris that nourish both crops and wild plants, help store carbon, improve groundwater recharge, and increase downstream water availability by as much as 28 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect that counters degradation, and you get all of these ecosystem services,\u201d she says.",
            "The structures on Nutlouis\u2019s farm are integral cogs in a larger system of floodplain farming. It works like this: Nutlouis\u2019s property lies in an alluvial fan, where mineral-rich sediments and plant waste atop mesas and other uplands wash down onto flatter ground with rainwater, snowmelt, and spring water. Across the valley, similar farms rely on this kind of system, many of which feature stone and stick constructions that Nutlouis helped build. The organic materials trapped behind the structures, says Jonathan Sandor, an emeritus agronomy professor at Iowa State University, \u201care a major input into keeping the fertility of the soils up.\u201d Such small watersheds are optimal: \u201cThese gentle slopes and small watersheds allow runoff but reduce the possibility of high runoff velocities that may damage crops,\u201d Sandor explained in a 2008 paper.",
            "BQ\u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d says an expert.",
            "Whether rock walls or ramps, hand-dug depressions in the soil, earthen walls, or branches plaited into dams, NIDS splash water over a wider area and slow its flow so it can better soak into the soil. Many trap sediments behind them, fertilizing whatever grows nearby. The stone structures create a hyperlocal cooling effect, especially when they\u2019re combined with shade-making vegetation.",
            "Here, too, smallness is a boon. \u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d Norman says. Up to five kilometers downstream from such structures, \u201cwe\u2019ve documented increased vegetation despite drought. We\u2019ve also documented [increased vegetation] up to one kilometer upstream, which indicates water availability.\u201d In this way, an alluvial farm and its NIDS can support plants both sown and wild.\n",
            "\u201cThe moisture we get from winter precipitation is really important for the corn to germinate and grow,\u201d says Nutlouis, \u201cand the monsoon rain is really important to finish our harvest of corn and squash and melons.\u201d He acknowledges that in practice this can look chaotic, with cornfields flooded up to their ears before the water trickles down to the next field.",

            "But lately, climate change has thrown extra challenges at the reservation. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious soil moisture deficit that\u2019s causing a lot of ecological shifts,\u201d Nutlouis says. Much of Black Mesa\u2019s pinyon forest, he says, has succumbed to two decades of drought. Historically, Din\u00e9 have foraged for pinyon pine nuts. They are an important component of food sovereignty on the reservation, and their loss is acutely felt.",
            "But the ecosystem services provided by Nutlouis\u2019s structures on his farm and elsewhere do seem to be meeting those climatic challenges. He\u2019s noticed small juniper trees popping up on hillsides around his property despite the dryness; A cottonwood tree towering over one cornfield is also lush and full. \u201cThe idea that Earth will restore itself with natural seed dispersal\u201d after NIDS begin to do their job \u201chas been my observation,\u201d says Norman. Or as Nutlouis puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re allowing nature to do its own thing and restore itself.\u201d",
            "Still, Nutlouis is inclined to help the process along. His nonprofit Nihikeya (loosely translated as a collective ecological footprint) collaborates with a variety of local and regional grassroots groups that work on food, water, and justice issues, like Tolani Lake Enterprises, First Nations Development Institute, and the Ten Tribes Partnership. Din\u00e9 C.A.R.E., another collaborator, is an environmental justice organization that advocates for community health and land rights across the reservation, as well as for the cleanup of coal- and uranium-polluted rivers and aquifers. \u201cWe especially want to support a lot of renewable projects through solar and wind, and we want to support agriculture too, because having a robust food system is a form of revenue for local farmers,\u201d says executive director Robyn Jackson. \u201cIt also helps with continuing our cultural traditions.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to farming into the future,\u201d says a Navajo activist.",
            "Nihikeya also works closely with the water-rights organization T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed, whose members are collecting native plant seeds to restore riparian habitat across Black Mesa. Some of those native plants, like wolfberry, are edible, which will also help improve food sovereignty and security. \u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to continuing farming into the future,\u201d says T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed executive director Nicole Horseherder.",
            "To house accessions of pinyon and juniper, willow, wolfberry bush, three-leaf sumac, and rabbit brush, Nutlouis is building a seed bank. When put back into the landscape, these plants will help keep the ground moist and mitigate erosion.\n",
            "Nutlouis is working on his master\u2019s degree in sustainable communities at Northern Arizona University, where he studies the Western science that qualifies and quantifies the benefits of traditional practices. But he is also adamant that watershed restoration success is predicated on reforging ancestral kinship connections \u2014 that is, on returning the power to make land-use decisions to clan mothers, who were traditionally Din\u00e9 leaders in this arena. To that end, he\u2019s been meeting with neighbors in one tiny watershed of Burnt Corn Valley after another to discuss how to improve the health of their land, whether for growing corn or just ensuring roads remain intact when it rains. So far, Nutlouis has helped restore 56 fields across the valley, with more NIDS than he can count.",

One of her NIDS study sites saw its water availability extended from three months to four months. \u201cYou can envision how important that is for arid lands,\u201d she says.",

Plankton are at the base of the ocean food chain, feeding fish that feed billions of people. They are responsible for half of the world\u2019s oxygen supply and half of our planet\u2019s annual carbon sink. Miniscule but powerful, their presence can help or hinder ecosystems \u2014 by soaking up greenhouse gas, for example, or by spewing toxins. Where plankton live, how many there are, when they bloom and which species dominate each play a huge role in this delicate balance. And our changing climate is spurring a sea change in all of it.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re headed into an ocean and, for that matter, a world that we\u2019re not going to recognize because it\u2019s changing so fundamentally,\u201d says David Hutchins, a marine microbiologist at the University of Southern California, who has charted plankton\u2019s future.\n",
            "Climate change is hitting our oceans hard, making them warmer and more acidic, while radically altering currents. The outlook for plankton is mixed. Some studies report overall plankton numbers dropping, while others show them rising in some major ocean basins. As the planet warms, the diversity of the menagerie in many spots is increasing, says Clare Ostle, a marine biogeochemist at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. But certain species are losing out, she adds, including big juicy plankton thought to be important for food webs and carbon sequestration. And, in the long term, plankton numbers may plummet as climate change starves them of nutrients.\n",
            "BQScientists are shocked by the knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says one expert.",
            "Scientists are now struggling to work out what the net effect will be. They have some new technologies at their disposal, including a new NASA satellite called PACE \u2014 for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem \u2014 launched this February. And some old ones, including a decades-old program that painstakingly trawls the ocean with filters to scoop up tiny creatures and count them by hand. Yet scientists say they are shocked by the size of our knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "The Ocean Stewardship Coalition this month released a \u201cplankton manifesto\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, highlighting how important plankton are alongside how little we know about them. \u201cThe planetary importance of plankton remains largely ignored,\u201d the group writes, alongside a plea for more research, education, and discussion in international treaties about plankton\u2019s plight.\n",
            "The word \u201cplankton,\u201d from the Greek for \u201cwanderer,\u201d is a catchall for the host of tiny creatures that live in fresh or salty water and drift where the currents take them. That includes plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and things that blur the lines between categories in a way that land-dwelling organisms typically don\u2019t. There are phytoplankton that feed on sunlight and CO2, including glassy diatoms, dinoflagellates with whip-like tendrils, and spherical coccolithophores that are struggling against ocean acidification to build hard calcite shells. Others are zooplankton \u2014 tiny animals including shelled foraminifera, along with fish larvae, tiny worms, and even jellyfish. Some have a lifespan of just days; others, years.",

His modelling, in agreement with other work, predicts that as waters warm, plankton will move polewards at a rate of about 21 miles per decade. \u201cSome changes will be massive, like in the Arctic, where entire communities will be replaced by something new,\u201d he says. Phytoplankton seem better able to cope with gradual warming than zooplankton, Benedetti says, so their habitat range and diversity looks set to increase in most regions. But that\u2019s not necessarily good news: the most productive ocean regions, counterintuitively, have low diversity, Benedetti notes. And more diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher numbers of plankton overall.",
            "In the long term, researchers fear an overall decline in plankton numbers thanks to a dwindling supply of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and iron. Plankton typically rely on nutrients that have been mixed from the ocean bottom up to the surface. But melting polar ice and changing ocean currents are now increasing the density difference between top, fresh waters and deeper, saltier waters, making these layers ever-less-likely to mix. This increased \u201cstratification,\u201d as it is called, is expected to starve ever-more regions of the ocean. While some coastal regions are drowning in too much nitrogen, which runs off agricultural fields, much of the open ocean might become \u201cmore desert-like,\u201d says Hutchins.\n",
            "BQScientists have investigated dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. ",
            "A factor working against this trend is pollution from both the burning of fossil fuels and from wildfires, which can carry nutrients far out into ocean waters. The wildly destructive Australian wildfire season of 2019-2020, for example, poured so much nutritional iron into the water that phytoplankton concentrations doubled between New Zealand and South America, creating an algae bloom bigger than Australia that lasted for months. The biggest surprise was how long the blooms lasted, says Jakob Weis at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, who studied the phenomenon. The amount of carbon soaked up by those organisms is thought to have roughly matched the carbon spewed by the fires \u2014 a helpful factor in the context of climate change. \u201cWe intentionally refrained from framing the blooms as \u2018good news,\u2019 given the devastating impact the wildfires had on the Australian public, wildlife, terrestrial ecosystems, and climate,\u201d says Weis. But the plankton, at least, were \u201chappy.\u201d",
            "Such nutrient influxes could be a big deal, says Hutchins, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where waters are particularly starved of iron. But the long-term impacts are entirely unclear. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s going to balance out some of what\u2019s not mixing up from below, or if it\u2019s going to select for different communities, different species, because it\u2019s chemically different [food],\u201d says Hutchins. Such blooms won\u2019t make a big dent in the big-picture fight against global warming, adds Ostle. \u201cWe\u2019ve burned thousands of years of deposits of oil and gas. The phytoplankton blooms aren\u2019t going to be able to cut it.\u201d\n",

            "Since the 1990s, some small-scale experiments have investigated the idea of intentionally dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. But early tests suggested that such a geoengineering scheme might not be very effective at burying carbon in the seabed for the longterm, while being expensive and difficult to carry out \u2014 not to mention the possibly huge, unknown consequences for ocean life. There have been international moratoria against large-scale commercial fertilization efforts since 2008, but research into the idea continues. Just last month, Ken Buesseler at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and colleagues laid out a research agenda for how to best assess this strategy\u2019s possible risks and benefits. \u201cYou learn a lot from these experiments,\u201d says Benedetti, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t see this as a long-term solution.\u201d",
            "In the face of so much uncertainty, it\u2019s vital for researchers to get on-the-ground data about how plankton are faring. The longest-running program to do this is the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, an effort that has been attaching collection devices onto ocean-crossing ships since the 1930s. The technique is simple: Plankton get scooped out of surface waters and squashed onto a filter like bugs on a car windscreen. The filter rolls up as the ship moves along, creating a scroll-like record of plankton roadkill from across the ship\u2019s track. Those filters are delivered to a lab where they are unspooled and the plankton peered at through a microscope. About a dozen workers at the Marine Biological Association, the effort\u2019s headquarters, have been trained to identify more than 600 different types of tiny creature \u2014 a task they are now trying to bolster with artificial intelligence algorithms.\n",
            "BQIn the Atlantic around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining by around 10 percent per decade. ",
            "The vast majority of the CPR\u2019s data comes from the North Atlantic \u2014 a well-travelled region that happens to play an oversized role in global carbon uptake. Ostle, who heads up the Pacific Branch of the CPR, says the data here shows plankton biomass increasing near the pole and decreasing closer to the tropics, as expected.",
            "Most of the increase is, interestingly, diatoms, says Ostle \u2014 large, round phytoplankton that form juicy food balls for fish and which tend to sink quickly, making them good carbon storage bombs. \u201cIt was a surprise to see this,\u201d says Ostle. It\u2019s an important shift: \u201cDiatoms are really the engines of carbon fixation,\u201d says Hutchins, who estimates they are responsible for about half of phytoplanktons\u2019 total carbon uptake.\n",
            "Ostle suspects the explanation behind the unexpected North Atlantic diatom boom lies with sunlight. The increased ocean stratification that can stop nutrients from mixing upwards has also managed to trap diatoms in surface waters that are bathed in more light; they stay in the growing zone for longer. Eventually, says Ostle, the food disadvantage of increased stratification will likely outweigh the light advantage. But when and how remains uncertain.",

            "The story varies from region to region. In the northeast Atlantic, around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining at rates of around 10 percent per decade. Some researchers have even suggested that the infamous North Sea cod crash in the 1990s, usually attributed to overfishing, was exacerbated by a plankton deficit. In the Arctic Ocean, though, plankton numbers have blossomed, with productivity increasing by more than half between 1998 and 2018, thanks not just to more open water from melting ice but also to increased nutrients, possibly introduced to the Arctic by storms and shifting currents.",
            "There\u2019s less data in the North Pacific and in the subtropics, but both are now starting to show an important shift away from large diatoms towards dinoflagellates, says Ostle. These smaller creatures are less nutritious; fish have to work harder to eat more of them. \u201cThat could have really big implications for the fisheries. We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "Dinoflagellates are also the plankton responsible for bioluminescence \u2014 and, sometimes, for generating biotoxins that lead to shellfish poisoning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting big bioluminescent blooms off of Southern California,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty if you go out for a walk on the beach at night and the waves are all lighting up, but they also have toxins,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they [dinoflagellates] are going to be one of the winners too, in in the future warmer ocean.\u201d",

That should let researchers identify some specific species or groups of plankton, says Cecile Rousseaux, PACE science lead at NASA Goddard. \u201cIt tells us not just total phytoplankton, but who is in there, what type of plankton,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new level of information.\u201d",
            "Meanwhile research continues \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty to unravel. Scientists must figure out not just which plankton species are where but also exactly when, since shifts in bloom timing can also have big knock-on effects for fisheries, says Ostle. And, she adds, the viruses that attack plankton seem to be on the rise as waters warm \u2014 another factor with as-yet unknown consequences.",
            "Thankfully, says Hutchins, plankton have proven to be pretty robust and adaptable over billions of years of Earth\u2019s history \u2014 so the oceanic food chain will persist in one form or another. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to drive ocean life to extinction,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be different dominant species \u2014 and maybe they\u2019re not going to be the ones we wish were there.\u201d",

            "Some 50 miles southwest of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, and strategically located close to a cluster of the island\u2019s top universities, the 3,500-acre Hsinchu Science Park is globally celebrated as the incubator of Taiwan\u2019s most successful technology companies. It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. ",
            "Today Taiwan\u2019s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan\u2019s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. ",
            "It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent.\n",
            "BQBy 2030, Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry will consume twice as much electricity as the whole of New Zealand.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s more than 23 million people consume nearly as much energy per capita as U.S. consumers, but the lion\u2019s share of that consumption \u2014 56 percent \u2014 goes to Taiwan\u2019s industrial sector for companies like TSMC. In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan\u2019s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s government is banking on the continuing success of its technology sector and wants the island to be a leader in A.I. But just one small data center, the Vantage 16MW Data center in Taipei, is expected to require as much energy as some 13,000 households. Nicholas Chen, a lawyer who analyses Taiwan\u2019s climate and energy policies, warns that the collision of Taiwan\u2019s commitments to the clean energy transition and its position in global supply chains as a key partner of multinational companies that have made commitments to net-zero deadlines \u2014 along with the explosive growth in demand \u2014 has all the makings of a crisis.\n",
            "\u201cIn order to plan and operate A.I. data centers, an adequate supply of stable, zero-carbon energy is a precondition,\u201d he said. \u201cA.I. data centers cannot exist without sufficient green energy. Taiwan is the only government talking about A.I. data center rollout without regard to the lack of green energy.\u201d",

            "It is not just a case of building more capacity. Taiwan\u2019s energy dilemma is a combination of national security, climate, and political challenges. The island depends on imported fossil fuel for around 90 percent of its energy and lives under the growing threat of blockade, quarantine, or invasion from China. In addition, for political reasons, the government has pledged to close its nuclear sector by 2025.",
            "Taiwan regularly attends U.N. climate meetings, though never as a participant. Excluded at China\u2019s insistence from membership in the United Nations, Taiwan asserts its presence on the margins, convening side events, and adopting the Paris Agreement targets of peak emissions before 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. Its major companies, TSMC included, have signed up to RE100, a corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged to achieve net zero production. But right now, there is a wide gap between aspiration and performance. ",
            "Angelica Oung, a journalist and founder of the Clean Energy Transition Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for a rapid energy transition, has studied Taiwan\u2019s energy sector for years. When we met in a restaurant in Taipei, she cheerfully ordered an implausibly large number of dishes that crowded onto the small table as we talked. Oung described two major blackouts \u2014 one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge.\n",
            "BQTaiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, leaving it vulnerable to both price fluctuations and blockade by China. ",
            "Nicholas Chen argues that government is failing to keep up even with existing demand. \u201cIn the past eight years there have been four major power outages,\u201d he said, and \u201cbrownouts are commonplace.\u201d ",
            "The operating margin on the grid \u2014 the buffer between supply and demand \u2014 ought to be 25 percent in a secure system. In Taiwan, Oung explained, there have been several occasions this year when the margin was down to 5 percent. \u201cIt shows that the system is fragile,\u201d she said. ",
            "Taiwan\u2019s current energy mix illustrates the scale of the challenge: Last year, Taiwan\u2019s power sector was 83 percent dependent on fossil fuel: Coal accounted for around 42 percent of generation; natural gas 40 percent; and oil 1 percent. Nuclear supplied 6 percent, and solar, wind, hydro, and biomass together, nearly 10 percent, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, which leaves the island at the mercy both of international price fluctuations and potential blockade by China. The government has sought to shield consumers from rising global prices, but that has resulted in growing debt for the Taiwan Electric Power Company (Taipower), the national provider. In the event of a naval blockade by China, Taiwan could count on about six weeks reserves of coal but not much more than a week of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Given that LNG supplies more than a third of electricity generation, the impacts would be severe. \n",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19557263/embed",
            "The government has announced ambitious energy targets. The 2050 net-zero roadmap released by Taiwan\u2019s National Development Council in 2022 promised to shut down its nuclear sector by 2025. By the same year, the share of coal would have to come down to 30 percent, gas would have to rise to 50 percent, and renewables would have to leap to 20 percent. None of those targets is on track. ",
            "Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. \u201cThe problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don\u2019t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.\u201d Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks.",
            "According to Peter Kurz, a consultant to the technology sector and a long-term resident of Taiwan, there is one renewable resource that the nation has in abundance. \u201cThe Taiwan Strait has a huge wind resource,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the most wind power anywhere in the world available close to a population.\u201d",
            "BQGovernment critics regard the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor as needless self-harm.",
            "Offshore wind is under development, but the government is criticized for imposing burdensome requirements to use Taiwanese products and workers that the country is not well equipped to meet. They reflect the government\u2019s ambition to build a native industry at the same time as addressing its energy problem. But critics point out that Taiwan lacks the specialist industrial skills that producing turbines demands, and the requirements lead to higher costs and delays.",
            "Despite the attraction of Taiwan\u2019s west coast with its relatively shallow waters, there are other constraints, such as limited harbor space. There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan\u2019s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters from China\u2019s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable.",
            "Government critics regard one current policy as needless self-harm: the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor by next year and achieve a \u201cnuclear free homeland.\u201d It is a pledge made by the current ruling party, the Democratic People\u2019s Party (DPP) and, as the deadline approaches, it is a policy increasingly being questioned. Taiwan\u2019s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978. The DPP came into existence in 1986, the year of the Chernobyl disaster, and its decision to adopt a no-nuclear policy was reinforced by the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan in 2011.",

            "Of Taiwan\u2019s six nuclear reactors, three are now shut down, two have not been brought online, and the one functioning unit is due to close next year. The shuttered reactors have not yet been decommissioned, possibly because, in addition to its other difficulties, Taiwan has run out of waste storage capacity: The fuel rods remain in place because there is nowhere else to put them. As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change. Voters added to the confusion in 2021 when they opposed the completion of the two uncommissioned plants.",
            "On the 13th floor of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei, the deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s energy administration, Stephen Wu, chose his words carefully. \u201cThere is a debate going on in our parliament,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the public has demanded a reduction of nuclear power and also a reduction in carbon emissions. So there is some discussion about whether the [shuttered] nuclear plants will somehow function again when conditions are ready.\u201d",
            "BQIf Taiwan does not accelerate clean energy deployment, companies will be obliged to leave the island, an analyst warns.",
            "Wu acknowledged that Taiwan was nudging against the limits of its current supply and that new entrants to Taiwan\u2019s science and technology parks have to be carefully screened for their energy needs. But he took an optimistic view of Taiwan\u2019s capacity to sustain A.I. development. \u201cWe assess energy consumption of companies to ensure the development of these companies complies with environmental protection,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Singapore, data centers are highly efficient. We will learn from Singapore.\u201d",
            "Critics of the government\u2019s energy policy are not reassured. Chen has an alarming message: If Taiwan does not radically accelerate its clean energy development, he warns, companies will be obliged to leave the island. They will seek zero-carbon operating environments to comply with the net-zero requirements of partners such as Amazon, Meta, and Google, and to avoid carbon-based trade barriers such as the European Union\u2019s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. ",
            "\u201cWind and solar are not scalable sources of zero-carbon energy,\u201d he said. \u201cNuclear energy is the only scalable, zero-carbon source of energy. But the current laws state that foreign investment in nuclear energy must be capped at 50 percent, with the remaining 50 percent owned by Taipower. Given that Taipower is broke, how could a private investor want to partner with them and invest in Taiwan?\u201d",

            "Chen argues that Taiwan should encourage private nuclear development and avoid the burdensome regulation that, he says, is hampering wind development.",
            "For Kurz, Taiwan\u2019s energy security dilemma requires an imaginative leap. \u201cCables [carrying offshore wind energy] are vulnerable but replaceable,\u201d he says. \u201cCentralized nuclear is vulnerable to other risks, such as earthquakes.\u201d One solution, he believes, lies in small modular nuclear reactors that could even be moored offshore and linked with undersea cables. It is a solution that he believes the Taiwan\u2019s ruling party might come around to.",
            "There is a further security question to add to Taiwan\u2019s complex challenges. The island\u2019s circumstances are unique: It is a functioning democracy, a technological powerhouse, and a de facto independent country that China regards as a breakaway province to be recovered \u2014 if necessary, by force. The fact that its technology industry is essential for global production of everything from electric vehicles to ballistic missiles has counted as a security plus for Taiwan in its increasingly tense stand-off with China. It is not in the interest of China or the United States to see semiconductor manufacturers damaged or destroyed. Such companies, in security jargon, are collectively labelled Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a shield the government is keen to maintain. That the sector depends inescapably on Taiwan\u2019s energy security renders the search for a solution all the more urgent."

            "They call it the Doomsday Glacier. A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geoengineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change.",
            "Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral \u2014 eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",
            "BQGlaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century.",
            "Meanwhile, some of his collaborators, fearing the logistical complications of such a task, are pondering an even more mind-bending idea. They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can\u2019t wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t mitigate our way out of this,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe need other tools.\u201d\n",
            "Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls.\n",
            "Back in 1978, glaciologist John Mercer, of Ohio State University, warned of a \u201cmajor disaster \u2013 a rapid five-meter rise in sea level, caused by deglaciation of West Antarctica\u201d \u2014 should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise. Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "Ice-sheet modeling last year by Kaitlin Naughten of the British Antarctic Survey concurred. \u201cThe opportunity to preserve the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in its present-day state has probably passed,\u201d she concluded, \u201cand policymakers should be prepared for several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.\u201d",
            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",
            "BQSome experts are confident that giant undersea curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean.",

            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.

The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",

Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "Down on the south end of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, oil rigs have plumbed the earth like flocks of blackened drinking birds for more than a century. Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

            "Researchers at NREL had been thinking about something like GeoTES for years, but they needed funding and land to make it a reality, which led them to partner with a Kern County-based energy investment firm, Premier Resource Management, in Bakersfield. In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea. By early this year, when California officially announced a ban on new permits for hydraulic fracking, they were fully focused on a way to give the old wells new life \u2014 as a battery, of sorts.\n",
            "BQTo survive a downturn in oil and gas, Kern County aims to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub.",
            "In its heyday in the mid-1980s, Kern County produced 256 million barrels of oil a year, and it remains the seventh-largest oil producing county in the U.S. Despite the industry\u2019s harm \u2014 more people per capita die from chronic lower respiratory disease here than anywhere else in California \u2014 drilling still pumps $13 billion a year into the local economy. Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",

            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",

The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts.

In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",

According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this.

The conflagration killed 1.3 million Joshua trees, including most of those on Cima Dome, one of the largest and densest Joshua tree woodlands in the world.\n",
            "Then in 2023, the York Fire swept through and burned a large section of adjacent Joshua tree forest, killing another million or so trees. The destruction on Cima Dome \u2014 which is higher in elevation and cooler than the surrounding desert \u2014 came as an especially severe blow to the National Park Service and conservationists who had considered it a stronghold for the eastern Joshua tree and a key to the species\u2019 future.\n",

Grasses such as red brome and Mediterranean split grass are highly flammable, and in wet years they grow in profusion and create more intense and far more widespread fires.",
            "There is also concern that the invasion of exotic species, in combination with climate change and the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen \u2014 which wafts in from the smoggy Los Angeles basin and stimulates the growth of flammable grasses \u2014 will keep the post-fire Joshua woodlands from reestablishing themselves. Instead, those areas could convert to a non-native grassland with low biodiversity.",

The federal government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, rejected federal endangered species protection for both subspecies, most recently in 2023.",
            "One reason for the lack of protection is that there is currently no shortage of Joshua trees \u2014 the threat is based on projections of future loss.

Nonetheless, Cummings argues that they are both deserving of protection because the forecasts of the future look bleak. \u201cWe know they are on an extinction trajectory, given the threat of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf climate change is frozen at current levels, we [still] lose half their range.\u201d Temperatures, of course, are not expected to remain steady.",

In Joshua Tree National Park, managers are clearing grasses in refugia, for example, to remove fuel and create fire breaks between trees.",

You\u2019ve got to move the yucca moth pollinator. You\u2019ve got to monitor. All of the research we\u2019ve seen so far suggests it\u2019s not a viable option at this moment in time.

So Joshua trees as a species are not going to go extinct, but areas of the Mojave Desert will become more ecologically depauperate if they lose the Joshua tree \u2014 unless we can reverse the climate change issue.\u201d "

Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years. The population numbers continue to go down; soon we risk going underneath the survival threshold of the species.\u201d"

All seven sea turtle species are currently endangered or threatened, notes Christine Figgener, a German-born conservation biologist who has been working in Costa Rica for the past 16 years. ",
            "The number of nesting females on the beaches she studies is down more than 80 percent from when she first arrived there, Figgener said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. It\u2019s part of a global decline driven by a perfect storm of threats including plastics in the ocean, chemical pollution, industrial fishing, unregulated coastal development, and climate change.",
            "Figgener, 40, gained international attention when a video that she took of a sea turtle with a plastic straw lodged in its nostril went viral. The video helped launch a movement to eliminate plastic straws, which led to bans in Seattle and other cities around the world. But she says that\u2019s only a start. \u201cOur world, our oceans are much too complex to say that if we just stop eating fish or using plastic straws or what have you, sea turtles will be safe,\u201d she said.",

I\u2019d never seen a sea turtle nesting before. It is this ancient creature larger than I am that goes through a life program that they have been following for millions of years. I quickly fell in love with sea turtles and felt guilt, in a way, too. I mean they have been around for such an incredibly long period of time. Here they are on the brink of extinction because of us humans. I just felt \u2014 that cannot happen, at least not in my lifetime.",

We also have a massive problem with erosion [of beaches where turtles nest] due to rising sea levels.",
            "Nesting season is just now beginning here on the Caribbean coast. We are seeing one or two females nesting a night. When I first began my work here [in 2007] we were seeing 800 leatherback females nesting in a season. Now we are down to 50 to 150 on our beach. That downward trend is happening all over the world.\n",
            "e360: You excavate sea turtle eggs and rebury them. Why?",
            "Figgener: We do this because poachers would see the tracks in the sand of the nesting females and find the eggs if we left them where they were. Or in some cases the ocean would wash them away if they were buried too low down on the beach. So what we do is we put a little bag under the female while she is laying the eggs and we take the eggs to a more secure place to rebury them. We are careful to leave no track, so the poachers won\u2019t know where they are.",

This one male had something strange in his nose. We thought at first it might be a barnacle or a tube worm. But when we started pulling it out and snipped off a little piece, it became clear that it was plastic straw.",

            "Once, I watched this female leatherback turtle on our beach trying to lay her eggs. She was pressing and pressing and nothing came. Eventually I felt with my hands in her cloaca, and there was something funny in there. I tugged on it, and it came out, a plastic trash bag. She had ingested it, and she was lucky enough that it went through the entire intestinal tract. After I removed the bag, she was finally able to lay her eggs.\n",

We also have the problem of so-called ghost nets, nets that were lost or dumped and abandoned. Once a turtle gets entangled in a ghost net, they drag this big weight behind them. In some cases, they are not able to move at all. It also leads to many nasty cuts, amputations, and limb loss in sea turtles. Even a single fishing line wrapped around a flipper can cut off blood flow.",

In green turtles there is a type of cancer called fibropapillomatosis, which creates cauliflower-shaped tumors on soft tissue, like the eyes and the skin, and is basically triggered by fertilizer runoff. This runoff also creates dead zones in the ocean and toxic red tides where the turtles will feed on the algae blooms and eventually die.",

            "Figgener: A lot of things came together in the favor of the Kemp ridleys. Back in the late 70s and 80s there were only a few hundred nesting females left in the Gulf of Mexico. These turtles often ended up in the nets of shrimp trawlers. In response, the U.S. mandated a turtle excluding device attached to the nets which reduced bycatch by about 90 percent.",

            "Some eggs were transported from Mexico to Texas where [a nesting colony was re-established at Padre Island National Seashore.] And there was a \u201chead start program\u201d in the U.S. in which eggs were incubated in a controlled environment and then grown until they were the size of a plate and no longer so vulnerable to predation as tiny baby sea turtles are when they are born. These turtles were then released into the Gulf.",

If we know enough about the ecology of the species, where they feed, where they mate and so on, it could happen. We can come up with successful strategies to save them.

We always have students from outside Costa Rica, and tourists. I think that passion that makes people travel all that way to see a nesting sea turtle definitely changes something in the mindset of the people who live here. It also shows them that you can earn more money with a live turtle than by eating the meat or selling the eggs.\n",

By the end of his probe into the supply chain of JBS, the world\u2019s largest meat processing and packing company, Marcel Gomes reckons he and his team at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based nonprofit Rep\u00f3rter Brasil knew more about the origins of the beef it supplies from the Amazon to the world\u2019s hamburger chains and supermarkets than the company itself. ",
            "With grassroots support from labor unions and Indigenous communities, he had mapped the complex networks of cattle farms responsible for illegal deforestation. He then tracked the often-illicit beef through JBS\u2019s slaughterhouses and packing plants to the freezers, shelves, and customer trays of retail outlets and fast-food restaurants around the world. When his sleuths were done, the fingerprints of forest destruction were plain to see. Six of Europe\u2019s biggest retail chains reacted by halting purchases of JBS beef. \n",
            "That investigation just won Gomes, 45, a Goldman Environment Prize. But sadly, he says in an interview with Yale Environment 360, when he went to San Francisco last month to pick up the prize, stores there still had tainted beef on their shelves. \n",

            "Marcel Gomes: Well, Brazil is the world\u2019s biggest beef exporter. My country has more than 200 million cattle, and ranching is the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, where more than 40 percent of the cattle are raised. JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company. It exports leather \u2014 for instance to Germany, where it makes car seats \u2014 and biodiesel made from beef tallow. ",

So, at Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which was founded in 2008, we began to collect this public data on everything related to environmental, social, and labor issues. We started to cross-check the data so we could trace supply chains right from the ranch to consumers.",
            "Then we put this information together with data on areas where ranchers had been fined for environmental violations such as deforestation, and where there were reports of modern slavery and forced or child labor. We also used satellite images to identify which farms had seen deforestation each year, and we tapped into data on the transport of cattle from those farms to the slaughterhouses receiving the cattle.",

So, in 2021, we hired researchers in Europe and the U.S., as well as Brazil, to visit stores to find Brazilian beef and take pictures of the seals and export tracking numbers. Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from. For us it was very important to go to the supermarkets and take pictures, and to have that clear evidence.",
            "Then we connected both ends of the supply chain, and called everybody \u2014 the supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, the traders, JBS, the public health authorities, everyone \u2014 to tell them what we had found and ask for them to respond. Several supermarket chains in Europe believed our findings straight away and announced boycotts just as our report was published. They included Sainsbury\u2019s in the U.K., Carrefour in Belgium, and Auchan in France. Later, others joined them.\n",

They know the routes the trucks take, the names of people we can interview, and the workers who can tell inspectors about slavery. Indigenous communities especially know about the environmental impact they are suffering from the deforestation.",

            "Gomes: Yes. It is common to move cattle from farm to farm in Brazil, often three or four times. There can be legitimate reasons for doing this, because cattle raising is quite a specialized business. But it can also cover up a \u201cdirty\u201d trail.",
            "In theory there are rules to prevent the trading of cattle from illegal to legal areas. But in practice it is very easy to do, especially when you have several members of a family doing the same business. One brother can move cattle to the land of another brother, with no paperwork. Also, you can change the boundaries of your own land, for instance, by turning one ranch into two, one clean and the other dirty. Then you can just trade with companies like JBS from the clean part. \n",
            "That \u201claundering\u201d works because JBS and most of the other meat processors only keep a record of their direct supplier, the last step in the chain. So a lot of what happens before that is hidden.",

            "Raindrops. Blood. Snowmelt. Ashes. Hope. Pesticides. Ink. (When the Mongols plundered Baghdad in 1258 A.D., they tossed so many books from the city\u2019s libraries into the Tigris that the currents ran black with ink.) Dreams. Stories. Time.",
            "The photographer Murat Yazar understands this. He knows that rivers are the biographers of landscape. That they cradle within their currents a swirling distillation of every incident and anecdote that has transpired in the inhabited landscapes they course through. And few rivers carry a headier and more sobering brew of history \u2014 tales of human woe and triumph \u2014 than the Tigris and Euphrates, the fabled waterways that pour through the heartlands of Eurasian civilization, through the Fertile Crescent, from their chilly headwaters in the mountains of Turkey through vast watersheds in Syria, Kuwait, and Iran, to finally empty into Persian Gulf at the sweltering marshland shores of Iraq.",
            "Ten years ago, I walked with Yazar along the banks of Tigris at the antique settlement of Hasankeyf in Turkey. A local shepherd named \u00c7oban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf, once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels \u2014 a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory \u2014 were soon to be erased.",

            "Yazar\u2019s perspective is always local. He is an ethnic Kurd from \u015eanl\u0131urfa, Turkey, and the son of generations of shepherds; for him the human connections to this landscape of his childhood are sacred. The construction of hundreds of dams, canals, weirs, and diversion projects big and small are changing his homeland literally beyond recognition. Turkish authorities insist that the millions of tons of poured concrete for these river developments are essential for agricultural self-sufficiency, for irrigation, and the hydropower needed to help reduce the country\u2019s dependency on foreign energy.\n",
            "But Yazar captures a pastoral Mesopotamia \u2014 \u201cthe land between two rivers\u201d \u2014 being rapidly transformed by inundation, relocated villages, extensive mining projects, deteriorating water quality, and drastic climate change. The two life-giving rivers that long sustained the region\u2019s varied cultures are being throttled.",
            "While working on this project in Iraq near the Turkish border this summer, Murat was arrested by Kurdish security forces, who confiscated his camera and detained him for nine days.",
            "Back when I hiked the banks of the Tigris with Yazar, a frail truce between the Turkish army and Kurdish separatists was coming unraveled. (Immensely destructive military campaigns have since swept the region.) Refugees were flooding into Turkey from war-ruined Syria. And the tamed Tigris and Euphrates squeezed their way through endless pipes and concrete channels to distant Basra, the home of Sinbad the Sailor.\n",

            "*Electric_school_buses_charging_up_in_Oakland,_California,_last_month",
            "About 20 million students in the United States ride to school each day on the familiar yellow bus. The vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 490,000 school buses \u2014 which comprise the nation\u2019s largest public-transportation fleet \u2014 are powered by diesel engines. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning our kids on the way to school,\u201d said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children\u2019s lungs.",
            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",
            "*Children_aboard_an_electric_school_bus_in_Chevy_Chase,_Maryland,_last_February",
            "fCChildren aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February.\nTom Brenner / AP Photo.",
            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19371586/embed",
            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

Yet while other cities, such as Milwaukee and Boston, saw green measures as complements to gray infrastructure, Philadelphia placed rain gardens and bioswales \u2014 vegetated ditches that collect stormwater \u2014 at the center of its strategy. But now, critics say, these innovations are proving inadequate at handling the increase in extreme rainfall events. In fact, the amount of overflow from pipes that combine stormwater with raw sewage has actually increased since the Green Cities program began.\n",
            "BQGray infrastructure can take decades to implement and cost billions of dollars, but many cities don\u2019t have much of a choice.",
            "An average of 14 billion gallons of polluted stormwater have overflowed from Philadelphia\u2019s 164 sewage outfall pipes each year since Green City, Clean Waters began, according to \u201cUnraveling the Facts\u201d a new report from the Restore the River Advocacy Team, a group of water experts and environmentalists that includes the former heads of the interstate Delaware River Basin Commission and the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority, which manages wastewater in the southern New Jersey county.",

But its storage tunnels and tanks have done the most to reduce combined sewer overflows into Lake Michigan and local rivers, said Kevin Shafer, the district\u2019s executive director. He estimated that the system\u2019s gray infrastructure can currently handle two and a half to three inches of rain at a time, while green measures can absorb only about half an inch.",
            "Still, he calls green infrastructure \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d because managing water where it falls protects water bodies from contaminants like bacteria, heavy metals, and trash, and it reduces the risk of basement backups. \u201cYou have to have both,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Despite its limited finances and aging infrastructure, Milwaukee\u2019s sewerage district has set a goal of eliminating combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2035. \u201cWith the changing climate we\u2019re facing,\u201d Shafer has said, \u201cit\u2019s like running uphill, and the hill keeps getting steeper and steeper.\u201d\n",
            "Boston, too, has emphasized gray infrastructure in its efforts to upgrade stormwater management. The city is operating under a long-term control plan \u2014 a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be \u201cfishable and swimmable.\u201d To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",
            "BQAlexandria\u2019s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four.",
            "But according to Max Rome, stormwater program manager for the nonprofit Charles River Watershed Association, the control plan\u2019s current goal may be impossible to meet. In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan.",
            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn\u2019t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.\u201d\n",
            "In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050\u2019s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That\u2019s above the watershed\u2019s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet.\n",
            "Increased rainfall is also affecting Western cities, including Portland, Oregon, which sharply reduced pollution in the downtown section of the Willamette River and Columbia Slough by building three tunnels to hold stormwater flows. The project, which nearly eliminated CSOs, took 20 years to complete, in 2011, and cost $1.4 billion.",

            "The 2.2-mile-long tunnel, completed at a cost of $615 million but not due to begin operating until early 2026, will reduce sewage and stormwater overflows into the Potomac River from 140 million gallons a year, between 2000 and 2016, to 17 million gallons a year, said Justin Carl, chief executive of AlexRenew, the city\u2019s public wastewater treatment authority. Alexandria\u2019s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four.",
            "The project includes some green infrastructure, like bioretention basins and tree wells that filter and retain stormwater runoff.

            "A much larger stormwater project is planned for the nation\u2019s capital, where DC Water, an independent local-government authority, is building an 18-mile network of tunnels to hold 249 million gallons of stormwater and sewage until it can be safely pumped to a treatment plant. When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",
            "Green infrastructure is just a small part of the overall project, costing $98 million out of a total budget of $3.29 billion, Wone said. The agency conducted green-infrastructure pilot projects at two sites and concluded that only one, in Rock Creek Park, was suitable for nature-based solutions because it had low overflow volumes and wasn\u2019t densely developed.\n",

            "Since that landmark study, more than 7,000 papers have come out about microplastics, including one coauthored by Thompson that was published in Science last month and warned that the tiny particles pose a growing biological threat to many species, including humans. The rate of global plastic production has roughly doubled in the last two decades. Without action at a global level, Thompson has written, plastic production could triple by 2060.",

I started asking the question, \u201cWhat are the smallest pieces?\u201d My students went out on the beach, and they brought back samples of sand. When we looked at them with a microscope, we saw pieces that didn\u2019t look like sand, that turned out to be plastic. We discovered that microplastics, including many smaller than the diameter of a human hair, contaminated waters around the U.K.",
            "In a 2004 paper published in Science, we showed that they were biologically available to a range of marine organisms. We also showed, using archived samples, that the abundance of these small fragments, which we named microplastics, had increased significantly since the 1960s. ",

And it wasn\u2019t until our 2004 paper that this really started to attract attention.

We\u2019ve failed to design plastics [for recycling and reuse] for example.

The packets, the bottles, all of those things will fragment over time into smaller and smaller pieces.

And neither did I see it from surface trawl data. But the reason I believe is that we weren\u2019t yet recording the small bits, so we were missing a fraction.

Among these hills, there are sacred sites where we communicated with the ancestors and communed with the forest, which we consider to be the nourishing mother. These lands our are identity. To deprive us of them is to exterminate us.\u201d \n",
            "\nThe African Commission\u2019s ruling is legally significant. It finds that the DRC government has violated 11 articles on human rights in the African Charter, to which it is a signatory. These include the rights of the Batwa to life, property, natural resources, development, health, religion, and culture. And it calls on the government to adopt into law as soon as possible \u201can effective mechanism for the delimitation, demarcation and titling of the territory traditionally occupied by the Batwa and the various natural resources attached to it in accordance with their tradition,\u201d and to annul all laws \u201cprohibiting the presence of the Batwa on ancestral lands and the enjoyment of the fruits of these lands.\u201d",
            "BQThe forced eviction of Indigenous people has often been planned, helped, and funded by Western conservation groups.",
            "The African Union has endorsed the commission\u2019s decision, but it is far from clear how the Congolese government will respond. According to an attorney based in Bukavu, who is part-Batwa and has been following the case closely, the government has all along attempted to thwart the commission\u2019s investigation. \u201cIt has never responded to correspondence addressed to it by the Commission, nor appeared before it, even though it is a signatory member of the African Charter.\u201d (Neither the commission nor the DRC government has responded to requests for comment.)",
            "The attorney, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, says the commission \u201cdoes not have the power to enforce its recommendations,\u201d but two other courts on human and peoples\u2019 rights linked to the African Union do have such powers. \u201cIf the DRC government continues to show bad faith, we will ask them to issue binding decisions,\u201d the attorney says. ",
            "The forced eviction of Indigenous people, such as the Batwa, from their ancestral lands across Africa has been widespread for decades. Usually carried out in the name of conservation, it has in the past often been planned, helped, and funded by Western conservation groups such as the WCS and World Wildlife Fund (WWF). The Batwa of Central Africa have particularly suffered.",

            "Physical violence has been frequent. In 2020, the U.N. Development Programme concluded that WWF had for years funded park guards that it knew inflicted violence on Baka people in the region\u2019s parks. The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization\u2019s work in the region.",
            "The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians \u2014 more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them.",
            "The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month \u2014 signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists \u2014 contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not \u201cdetract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d noting their \u201clands include more than one-third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cThe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park,\u201d says a conservationist.",
            "So the ruling by the African Commission on the land rights of the Batwa in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, an epitome of attempted fortress conservation, is being seen by many as a wider adjudication.",
            "Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas. UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site and calls it \u201cone of the ecologically richest regions of Africa.\u201d",
            "But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

            "Many armed groups stayed on after the civil wars, setting up crude mining operations for coltan (used in cellphones and personal computers), cassiterite (tin ore), and gold. Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",
            "BQ\u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that \u201cpark guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.\u201d",
            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas. The result, he says, is \u201cthousands of hectares of deforestation,\u201d visible in satellite images.",

            "Simpson accuses human rights lobbyists of having an \u201coverly idealized image of the Batwa as ecologically noble savages.\u201d Even so, he says the Batwa are minor players in a wider economy of ecological destruction. The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides \u201cideal hideouts\u201d for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is \u201cthe only feasible form of enforcement.\u201d",
            "But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",
            "\u201cDoes the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

If built, it will be one of the largest LNG export terminals in the country and, according to a Sierra Club estimate, annually produce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to those of more than 42 million cars.",

            "Roishetta Ozane: In 2020, I\u2019d ended up homeless with my six children after losing everything in Hurricanes Laura and Delta. I realized that I lived in a community that was surrounded by billion-dollar industries that had very little resources for people who looked like me. I got on Facebook and asked, \u201cWho needs help?\u201d So many people needed food. They needed water. People were newly homeless.",
            "I was looking at the connections between industrial pollution, the storms that were happening across Louisiana and Texas, and the proposed industry coming along the Gulf Coast. I was beginning to recognize how all of this was connected when I heard about these 20 proposed LNG terminals. My first question was, \u201cWhere are they going to go?\u201d I had this overwhelming feeling that they were going to push out more Black communities. I didn\u2019t want that to happen, so I wanted to educate people.",

            "Ozane: I don\u2019t have any federal funding. I get a few small grants from organizations, but a lot of the funding comes from crowdsourcing from across the U.S. I assist people with food, shelter, water, clothing, paying their utility bills, paying their rent. But then they come to our community outreach meetings, they protest. [In late June] I was able to organize over 200 people from Texas and Louisiana to march with over 1,000 people down Wall Street to tell banks to stop funding environmental racism in our communities. I can\u2019t talk to a person in my community about CP2 coming when they can\u2019t feed their families, when they can\u2019t pay their rent.

            "Ozane: I\u2019m originally from Mississippi. When we first came to Louisiana in 2003, I immediately knew that those industries were bad because we could see the fires and the smoke. The air smelled like rotten eggs one day and like Clorox the next. It made me sick. One of my sisters who worked at a petrochemical plant ended up being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. Her job was to watch the flare to see how big or small it would be, but she didn\u2019t know what was coming out of that thing.\n",
            "Three of my children have eczema, and two have asthma. My son was recently diagnosed with epilepsy. He started having seizures last year, at the age of 17. He had his first seizure while driving between two facilities that had flares going. Those flares are loud, they are bright, and those are seizure-triggering things. It was also a couple days after the explosion at [a local refinery]. I tried to get answers, but everybody I talked to said that the chemicals released from these facilities disappear out of your blood quickly.\n",

            "Ozane: There have been studies done by Tulane and LSU, but the studies I\u2019ve seen have been paid for by industry and are biased. The state of Louisiana has said that even though cancer rates are going up, there is no way to say that they\u2019re going up because industry has grown. Louisiana is third in the nation for cancer rates. People hear about Cancer Alley, not understanding that the entire state of Louisiana is a cancer state. I live about three and a half hours from Cancer Alley, and my community is surrounded by more than a dozen petrochemical and gas facilities and three LNG facilities.\n",

And shipping it across the ocean means more tanker traffic and dredging, more pollution, more pollution of our seafood. It\u2019s all for export, while driving up our energy costs here.

The Vessel Project fought coal in Westlake, Louisiana, and right behind coal came LNG. And right behind LNG, now, you have [new] petrochemical plants.
