            "These zebrafish are a \u201clab rat\u201d of the aquatic world. A new study finds they can yawn \u2014 especially after witnessing others of their kind yawning.",
            "You know that feeling. You see someone yawn and all of a sudden you, too, feel the urge to yawn. It turns out that\u2019s not unique to people, or even mammals. At least one type of fish will do this, too.",
            "Contagious yawning has been witnessed in several warm-blooded creatures. Besides us, these include chimps, lions and wolves. But here \u201cis the first time this has been demonstrated in [a cold-blooded] species,\u201d says Elisabetta Palagi. She works at the University of Pisa in Italy. As a comparative ethologist, she studies the behaviors of animals, often in the wild. Much of her work has focused on contagious behaviors \u2014 including yawning \u2014 in primates, such as monkeys and apes.",
            "In a new study, she and her team were curious to confirm whether fish yawn \u2014 and if it\u2019s contagious in them, too. People with freshwater aquariums often keep zebrafish (Danio rerio). That\u2019s the species Palagi\u2019s team chose for this work.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The scientists started by observing and filming 18 zebrafish in the lab. The fish usually breathe by quickly opening and closing their mouths. But sometimes they opened their mouths slowly. They also stretched it widely \u2014 then snapped it closed. This seemed to mimic what scientists usually describe in other animals that are yawning (including us).",
            "The researchers turned up many differences between a fish\u2019s normal breathing and a yawn. For instance, the fish opened their mouth wider during a yawn than when simply breathing. And about half the time, a yawning fish also stretched its body. This is \u201cvery interesting,\u201d Palagi says, and something \u201cwe absolutely did not expect to find.\u201d (Yawning people also tend to stretch their bodies about half of the time, she notes.)",

            "fCWhen opening their mouths to breathe, zebrafish tend to keep a straight, horizontal posture, as in the upper image, When yawning, their mouths open wider and the often arch their back, bringing their tails lower (bottom image), the researchers find. ",
            "Palagi and her team then trained an AI model to recognize those traits they had linked to yawning. Afterward, the researchers gave the AI many screenshots taken from videos of fish. In short order, that AI could distinguish between a yawn and normal breathing, in much the same way her group did.",
            "Next, the researchers showed zebrafish two types of videos. In one, a zebrafish yawned. In the other type, the fish just breathed normally. Palagi\u2019s group showed these videos to many fish and many times to each individual. Then they analyzed how the creatures responded.",
            "The fish were more than twice as likely to yawn when watching a video of another zebrafish yawning than when they were just breathing. This suggests yawning is contagious, the researchers now conclude.",
            "Zebrafish tend to swim in large groups, moving fast and changing direction as one. In the lab, when a fish responded to the video of a yawn, it also tended to change the direction in which it was swimming. In the wild, such a directional change in response to yawning might help zebrafish coordinate their movements, the researchers suspect.\u00a0",
            "Palagi\u2019s team shared its findings April 7 in Communications Biology.",
            "fCThis slowed-down video shows a zebrafish yawning, then turning to swim in a different direction.",
            "\u201cThis reads to me like the beginning of something \u2014 but nothing massively conclusive,\u201d says Cait Newport. She\u2019s a biologist who studies fish behavior at Oxford University in England. She did not take part in the new study.",
            "While she thinks these observations offer a \u201cgood start,\u201d it\u2019s still unclear why the fish would yawn together, she says. The directional change reported in fish that watched a video, she adds, is not enough to conclude that fish in the wild would use yawning to coordinate their movements. But it\u2019s a plausible hypothesis, she says.",
            "Noam Miller is a comparative psychologist. He works at Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. He finds the Italian group\u2019s study \u201cvery interesting\u201d and \u201csurprising.\u201d Still, he adds, there are many things left to learn.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen contagious yawning in a lot of mammals and birds \u2014 and then we have this one fish study,\u201d says Miller. \u201cWe need to fill in a lot of these gaps\u201d on whether fish would yawn \u2014 and do it contagiously \u2014 for the same reasons those warm-blooded animals do.",
            "Why animals yawn is still an open question, Palagi says. But she and her team think zebrafish could be a perfect animal to study yawning and why it\u2019s contagious. In fact, they plan to do just that. \u201cThis study opens the floodgates for many more [studies] to come.\u201d",

Some whales migrate thousands of miles, peeing out nutrients along the way, new data show. It\u2019s yet another way they help keep ocean ecosystems healthy.",
            "\u201cI think of whales like gardeners,\u201d says Joe Roman. He\u2019s a marine biologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington. His work has shown how whales often move nutrients from deeper water (where many dine) to near the surface (where they poop).",
            "But whales don\u2019t just swim up and down. They can migrate long distances between oceans. In fact, some marine giants migrate further than any other mammals on Earth.",
            "For instance, several whale species feed and fatten up in northern, nutrient-rich waters. This may be off the coasts of Alaska or Iceland. Later, they\u2019ll travel thousands of miles south to their winter breeding grounds in Hawaii or the Caribbean. Here, in these warmer and nutrient-poor waters, they\u2019ll give birth.",
            "During their long migration and breeding season, these whales don\u2019t eat. Or poop. They live off their blubber. And as they break down that fat for energy, extra water and nutrients are discarded in their pee.",

            "The researchers focused on gray, humpback and right whales. These toothless behemoths dine on tiny plankton, krill and small fish. (They filter this prey from the water using long, bristly, comb-like plates of baleen in their mouths.) To figure out how many whales there are and where they travel, the scientists looked up historic accounts. Then they compared it to data on whale sightings that people have been posting on websites.",
            "To estimate the nutrients being moved by these whales, they started with a focus on the animals\u2019 urine.",
            "Whales are too large to study in captivity. So the researchers lacked data on how much nitrogen \u2014 a major nutrient \u2014 they shed in pee. To gauge this, they turned to another, smaller marine mammal that fasts before breeding: elephant seals.",

            "In all, they now calculate, these three types of whales bring nearly 4,000 metric tons of nitrogen per year to their breeding grounds around Hawaii. That\u2019s more than can be found in 2 million large bags of garden fertilizer! If true, this estimate means visiting whales may be doubling the available nitrogen while they\u2019re there.",
            "That extra nitrogen feeds phytoplankton at the base of the ocean food chain. As they grow, these tiny algae and bacteria absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. And that can help slow climate change. ",

            "\u201cThe surprising thing was how much nitrogen whales moved in urine,\u201d Roman says. Whale pee was the largest source of this nutrient in their breeding waters. And before commercial whaling cut populations, migrating whales may have moved three times as much.",

            "Maxwell and Condon\u2019s team decided to track groundwater\u2019s flow beneath most of continental North America. They started with where this water reemerges in streams. Then, working backward, they figured out where it must have first seeped into the Earth.",
            "To do this, they built a computer model. It simulated North America\u2019s underground layers of rock to depths of 392 meters (1,200 feet). Next, they divided the continent into little blocks. Each was one kilometer long by one kilometer wide.",
            "Then they asked the model to calculate how much water would likely flow through each block. That would depend on the shape and thickness of Earth\u2019s underground layers and the space between the rocks.",
            "Each block is like a Lego brick, Maxwell says. Once they calculated water\u2019s flow in each one, they stacked them together \u2014 85 million of them.",
            "Then they added simulated water droplets to the computer model. The model \u201cpushes\u201d these droplets around based on how water would flow through the layers of below ground rock. And the scientists tracked everywhere they would go.",
            "\u201cThink of a video game: Where would the little ball go? It\u2019ll be pushed by the velocity this way,\u201d says Condon. \u00a0Then, \u201cwhere would it go next?\u201d",
            "Water often travels more than 97 kilometers (60 miles), the model showed. That wouldn\u2019t be far if water was streaming across the surface, says Maxwell. But it was far longer than it had been expected to flow below ground.",
            "Most water stays below the surface for five to 10 years, the model found. But buried aquifers (underground layers of water-filled rock) also exist. Water can collect in them for 100,000 to 1 million years.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/zyHtkDCwQUw?feature=oembed",
            "Rain and snow seep into the Earth, forming streams of groundwater that travel long distances below the surface.",
            "Knowing how far water travels and for how long helps determine impacts to water. How? \u201cIf you have pollution underground, you need to understand where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Maxwell explains.",
            "Consider, for instance, the nitrate fertilizers that farmers apply to soils. In large amounts, nitrates can harm people and aquatic life. Rain can wash these chemicals into groundwater. From there, they can potentially travel far from the farms on which they had been used. That can pollute water once thought to be free of such chemicals.",
            "Models might also point to where water being pumped from the ground at one site (for drinking or irrigation) had been on its way to hydrate a distant wetland. Knowing this, says Claudia Faunt, managers might then make sure they leave enough water in the ground to sustain that wetland \u2014 and the ecosystem it supports. Faunt didn\u2019t take part in the new study. But as a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in San Diego, Calif., she understands these issues.\u00a0",
            "\u201cEverything\u2019s connected,\u201d Maxwell says. By knowing how one watershed may be linked to others, you can understand how the system works as a whole, he explains. And that could be key to managing Earth\u2019s life-giving resource. \u00a0"

            "The particles that prompted this aurora likely arrived with the shock front of a CME. That\u2019s short for\u00a0coronal mass ejection. CMEs are large clouds of plasma and magnetic fields blasted into space from the sun. Sometimes, they careen toward planets. When they do, CMEs can paint auroras in Earth\u2019s skies too.",

            "A quasi-satellite orbits the sun with its planet. The object circles the planet while orbiting the sun. If you were to watch from space, the object would appear to loop around Earth as both objects travel around the sun. Those loops around Earth are usually oval-shaped, not circular. This stretched-out orbit can take the object far from its planet.",
            "Earth has several quasi-satellites. Cardea is one. This asteroid is less than 300 meters (985 feet) in diameter. Astronomers predict that in about 600 years, Cardea will likely be flung out of orbit. Kamo\u02bboalewa is another example. Astronomers believe this small asteroid is a fragment of the moon. In May 2025, the China National Space Administration launched a mission to collect samples from the object.",

            "Some flowers attract pollinators by emanating the smell of death. Examples include plants in the Eurya (left, E. japonica pictured), Asarum (A. simile, middle) and Symplocarpus (S. renifolius, right) groups. New research suggests all of these use the same genetic trick to achieve their awful stink.",
            "Not all plants attract pollinators by smelling sweet. Some stink like rotting meat or even dung. Those odors can attract flies that will pollinate them. This stench is much like the smell that comes from bacteria feasting on rotting corpses. How plants make such a foul smell has been a mystery \u2014 until now.",
            "Scientists in Japan looked at DNA in three unrelated groups of stinky plants. All had all evolved the same trick to produce this reeking scent. It involved\u00a0tweaking one gene. (Genes are bits of DNA related to certain traits.)",
            "The team shared its findings May 8 in\u00a0Science.",
            "First, the stinky plants all made an extra copy of a gene called\u00a0SBP1. This gene makes an enzyme. It helps break down a chemical called methanethiol (Meth-an-ETH-ee-awl). This molecule is already fairly smelly. It can build up in the mouths of some people who don\u2019t regularly brush their teeth. An oral condition can develop called halitosis, in which someone\u2019s breath becomes really stinky.",
            "The extra copy of SBP1 in the stinky plants is altered, or mutated. The affected gene now makes its enzyme with a few different amino acids in it. In some plants, three amino acids in this enzyme have been changed. Those plants include a type of wild ginger and the East Asian eurya shrub. In the Asian skunk cabbage, meanwhile, only two amino acids are changed.",
            "But those tiny changes have big impacts. The altered SBP1 enzyme no longer breaks down methanethiol. Instead, it links two of these molecules into dimethyl disulfide. That chemical is to blame for the much more putrid scent of rotten meat. It\u2019s also one of the chemicals responsible for the intense reek of the corpse flower (although the main ones there are putrescine and dimethyl trisulfide).",
            "*A_cartoon_of_a_fly_in_the_upper_left_corner_with_a_speech_bubble_showing_a_fork_and_knife_and_a_thou",
            "fCSome plants lure flies for pollination by smelling like rotting flesh. To do this, they make a chemical called dimethyl disulfide. This comic shows how these plants may fool hungry carrion flies by making the chemical, which stinks like garlic or rotting fish.",
            "What benefit do plants get from making the foul-smelling molecule? They may attract more flies to pollinate them.",
            "Gene duplication \u2014 like these plants did with SBP1 \u2014 is pretty common. It has happened in the evolution of most life-forms, including\u00a0humans.",
            "Flawed extra copies of genes become the sources of new traits in many species. The reason is that copies of genes can mutate without harming the original gene. This allows species to try out new traits without losing their old ones.",

            "Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth\u2019s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.",
            "Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",
            "Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth\u2019s inner structure. They\u2019ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists \u2014 \u00a0including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago \u2014 have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth\u2019s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",

            "This solid metal ball has a radius of 1,220 kilometers (758 miles), or about three-quarters that of the moon. It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

            "Earth\u2019s crust is like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. It is extremely thin, cold\u00a0and brittle compared to what lies below it. The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

In stories, a ghost may whisper or groan, cause things to move or fall, mess with electronics \u2014 even appear as a shadowy, blurry or see-through figure.",

One night, a big thud prompted her to grab her camera. This was the first picture she took. Other photos she took on that and later nights showed nothing unusual. Does this story make it seem like ghosts exist? Or is the glowing figure a flash of light that the camera accidentally captured?",

Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",
            "On ghost-hunting TV shows, people use scientific equipment to attempt to record or measure spirit activity. And numerous creepy photos and videos make it seem like ghosts exist. However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",
            "Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager.",
            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",

            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",

But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed.

Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",

            "Modern-day fireworks are high-tech versions of those ancient Chinese devices. Today\u2019s shells typically include some sort of fuel, often gunpowder. They also contain a chemical called an oxidizer. This helps the fuel burn more quickly. The shells also contain chemicals whose recipes include metals. Those metal-based compounds play a big part in determining the color of fireworks, explains Phil Grucci. He\u2019s the owner of Fireworks by Grucci in Bellwood, N.Y. His family business has been operating for almost 170 years.",
            "As a shell\u2019s fuel explodes, it releases a sudden burst of heat. That energy, in turn, excites electrons orbiting metal atoms packed along with the fuel, Grucci explains. Excited electrons jump to a higher orbital. Soon, they\u2019ll drop back to their original orbits again. At this point, the metal atoms emit a characteristic color of light.",
            "Different chemicals produce different hues. For example, chemicals that contain barium give off a greenish light. Copper yields a blue light. This can be easily seen in an experiment that\u2019s often a staple of high-school chemistry classes, says Grucci. A small wire is dipped into a powder and then thrust into a small flame. The color of the flame changes with the elements contained in the powder.",
            "To come up with a new color for a firework, members of Grucci\u2019s team, as well as the chemists they work with at other companies, do a version of that wire test. Now, however, these tests take place in bigger, better-funded labs.",

Also, as Chinese inventors long ago noted, slow-burning gunpowder doesn\u2019t explode. Instead, it gives off gases that can provide thrust for a rocket if they\u2019re forced through a nozzle.",

            "To design a fireworks shell that rises to a certain height before it blows up, there\u2019s a lot of math and lab work to be done. For instance: How quickly does 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of a particular mixture of gunpowder burn? What volume of gas does it give off? (Those things can be measured in the lab.) How much weight can that lift? (That can be measured in a field test.) Together, those data can help engineers figure out how much gunpowder will be needed to send a 10-kilogram (22-pound) shell, say, up 500 meters (1,640 feet) into the air.",
            "On larger scales, engineering challenges can be just as daunting. Consider the world-record-size shell that Grucci\u2019s company recently developed. The projectile measured about 1.5 meters (5 feet) across and weighed a whopping 1,000 kilograms (1.1 U.S. tons). It was fired from a tube and rose to a height of more than 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) before it burst. When the shell exploded, its colorful display measured more than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) across.",
            "One challenge, says Grucci, was fine-tuning the strength of the shell\u2019s outer casing, which was made of many layers of paper. For one thing, the casing had to be strong enough to survive the launch, he notes. (When the shell left its launch tube, it was traveling at a speed of 122 meters [400 feet] per second.) But the shell\u2019s outer casing couldn\u2019t be too\u00a0strong or the shell wouldn\u2019t burst open properly when it reached peak height, says Grucci. The engineers used computer software to estimate how shell casings of various thicknesses might stand up to the stresses of launch and explosion. At the same time, a different team was designing the steel tube needed to launch the shell. It ended up being 7 meters (23 feet) long. Designing and building it took his teams more than 10 months.",
            "\u201cDesigning that shell was quite an interesting journey,\u201d says Grucci. Near the end of the process, \u201call our math lined up,\u201d he notes. And the team\u2019s lab tests suggested that the shell would work, he adds. \u201cBut at some point in time you\u2019ve just gotta build it and launch it.\u201d",

            "Many challenges remain to be tackled, says Grucci. He\u2019d like to be able to reduce the amount of smoke that each shell produces. This might involve tweaking the ratio of fuel to oxidizer inside the shell. That, in turn, might lead to more complete burning of the chemicals inside the rockets. And needing smaller amounts of ingredients could greatly reduce overall costs. But there\u2019s another reason to go smokeless, he notes. Smoke emitted by shells designed to burst at low altitude can obscure the view of fireworks exploding higher up.",
            "Plus, Grucci would like to make his fireworks more ecofriendly. Smoke itself can be a problem, polluting the air. And many of today\u2019s shell casings are no longer bamboo, but plastic. As the shells explode, they send a rain of little plastic bits falling all over the ground. \u201cGreener\u201d fireworks, he says, might house the rocket\u2019s ingredients in polymers\u00a0that are biodegradable. That way, the debris that falls to the ground might naturally break down over time.",
            "A company that puts on only one or two fireworks shows per year probably wouldn\u2019t earn much money. So it pays to diversify beyond staging shows on the 4th of July and New Year\u2019s Eve. And many companies have done just that.",
            "Among them is Pyrotecnico, based in New Castle, Pa. It stages some 3,000 shows across the United States each year, notes owner Stephen Vitale. The majority of those are small community celebrations. But the company also has staged events that range from a Super Bowl halftime spectacular to weddings (where, Vitale says, \u201cOur fireworks are the icing on the cake\u201d).",
            "Fireworks are \u201cobviously a visual business,\u201d says Vitale. But shows, particularly the large ones, have really evolved in recent years. \u201cAbout 50 percent of the shows we do are choreographed with a musical soundtrack,\u201d he explains. \u201cWith music, crowds get more emotionally involved in the show.\u201d",

            "Making sure the soundtrack lines up with the bursting fireworks takes a lot of effort \u2014 and a lot of creativity. For each minute that a fireworks show lasts, his designers spend somewhere between 2 and 3 hours ahead of time getting the details right. They typically design the show using computer software. That software started out as an off-the-shelf program. Team members then tweaked the software to add new features. For instance, designers have to take into account how high a shell will fly, as well as how long it takes to reach that height and then burst to light the night sky.",
            "In a sense, Vitale says, a fireworks show is like staging a play. \u201cIn the first scene, you grab the audience\u2019s attention. After starting out strong, you program in a series of \u2018Wow!\u2019 moments,\u201d he points out. \u201cThen, you end with a bang!\u201d",
            "Designing the succession of bursts in a computer allows planners to visualize how a potential show will look. It also gives the company a way to preview the show. Designers can view via computer what the show would look like from any location in the area and from any angle. The team can then tweak the display as needed.",
            "The opportunity to be creative attracts a lot of people to the field, says Vitale. \u201cPeople get to be their own designer and choreographer, or direct their own play or movie,\u201d he notes.

In the United States, these technicians usually are certified by local or state authorities. To be certified in California, for example, the technicians must go through a training program, take a detailed test and have two years of job experience.",
            "Besides being trained in safety, the technicians have to be handy with tools and keenly creative. These are the workers who turn the designers\u2019 visions into a reality. Some design and assemble the circuits that control when shells get fired. Others design and build the brackets that hold fireworks at a particular angle so that the shells will fly off and burst at the proper locations and heights. Yet other technicians may have to hang off the sides of skyscrapers and bridges to install brackets and wiring.",
            "More than 50 people helped set up the fireworks show that lit up the Brooklyn Bridge, notes Souza. It took two weeks to set up a show that was over in less than half an hour.",
            "Like all fireworks firms, Souza\u2019s company has to abide by state and local environmental rules. One recent challenge has been a need to reduce their use of chemicals called perchlorates\u00a0(Per-KLOR-aytes). If some of those oxidizers are left over when a shell explodes, they can drop into waterways or onto soil and affect animals and plants living or growing there. Not only that, they can be harmful to human health. Among other problems, they can reduce the production of hormones in the thyroid gland. \u00a0",
            "So, there\u2019s plenty of challenges for people to address, both in the near term and into the future. The fireworks industry relies on many types of experts, says Grucci. In the end, one of the biggest challenges may be meeting customer expectations.

Fruits \u2014 such as bananas \u2014 have natural, light-filtering chemicals that may lead to eco-friendlier sunscreens.",
            "Columbus, Ohio \u2014 Bananas grow best in full sun. To protect their sensitive skins from damaging ultraviolet rays, banana peels produce a natural sunscreen. A teen has now peeled back the secrets of this natural sunblock. What she\u2019s found could lead to more eco-friendly sunscreens for all of us.",

            "fCTaylor Maguire investigated how banana peels might lead to more eco-friendly sunscreens.",
            "\u201cMy mom always raised me to pay attention to the ingredients in my cosmetics,\u201d says Taylor Maguire, 15. She prefers \u201corganic products over synthetic ones.\u201d That led this sophomore at Garden City High School in New York to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in my sunscreen?\u201d",
            "These products protect our skin against blistering solar rays. But their use comes at a price. Some of sunscreen\u2019s chemicals may cause cancer, Taylor notes. And when these chemicals wash into our environment, they can hurt animals. For example, some mineral sunscreens interfere with the ability of freshwater animals to navigate. High enough exposures, she says, can kill some organisms.",
            "So, Taylor looked for alternatives to mineral-based sunscreens.\u00a0",
            "Bananas can naturally filter out much of the sun\u2019s more damaging rays. Could their natural sunblock replace mineral sunscreens? Taylor investigated. And what she found out won her a spot here in May at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF.",
            "Bananas tend to grow in a \u201cUV-intense environment,\u201d Taylor says. UV \u2014 short for ultraviolet \u2014 is a band of light wavelengths. This high-energy light is invisible to the human eye. But it causes most of the sun\u2019s damage to our skin. For a sunscreen to work, it must protect against certain UV rays.",
            "Taylor had reasoned that bananas \u201cmust have their own mechanism.\u201d After all, they grow near the equator. That\u2019s where UV exposures are strongest.",
            "Plants typically make flavonoids \u2014 pigments that come in a rainbow of colors \u2014 as a defense against the sun\u2019s UV. Taylor wondered if banana flavonoids might work to protect our skin from UV, too.",
            "She wasn\u2019t sure exactly which bananas flavonoids to use. Taylor heated, froze and blended the outer layer of a banana peel. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s exposed to the sunlight,\u201d she explains. Any UV-filtering chemicals likely lie there.",
            "Breaking open the cells released many of their chemicals. From this soup she made two extracts. One of these contained only components that would dissolve in water. That was her aqueous extract. The other contained only chemicals that wouldn\u2019t dissolve in water. That was her nonpolar extract. Nonpolar chemicals dissolve in oil rather than water.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A sunscreen must absorb UV light before it reaches your skin. And the more it absorbs, the better. To test how well each extract could do that, Taylor turned to a light-measuring tool. Called a spectrophotometer, it measures how much of any color of light a liquid absorbs.",
            "The tool confirmed that both of her banana extracts absorbed UV light. But the nonpolar one went a step further. It absorbed the full range of UV wavelengths \u2014 and especially the most damaging ones. They belong to a part of the UV spectrum called UV-A.",
            "Would banana-based sunscreens also be safe for the environment? After all, Taylor says, typical drug-store sunscreens can harm aquatic life. To find out, she recruited planarians (Girardia tigrina) as her \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d Planarians are a type of flatworm that live in water. They\u2019re often used in drug-safety studies, Taylor explains. A chemical that harms these worms might also pose a risk to other aquatic animals.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!4",
            "fCTaylor created two banana-extract solutions \u2014 one nonpolar and one aqueous. She also created mineral-sunscreen solutions for comparison. Spectrophotometry allowed her to test wavelengths of light absorbed by each sample. She also used a microscope to observe planarians\u2019 locomotion \u2014 or movement \u2014 when exposed to UV light.",
            "The plan was to put planarians into dishes with different extracts and expose them to strong UV light for 10 minutes. If the worm\u2019s movement slowed or stopped, she took that to mean the light damaged them. Her five test solutions included her two extracts, a drugstore sunscreen solution, plain water and glycerol.",
            "Why glycerol? The nonpolar extract and sunscreen solution both contained this thick liquid. Taylor tested glycerol by itself to check if it caused problems on its own.",
            "And it did. \u201cThe nonpolar banana, the glycerol and the mineral sunscreen [appeared] fatal\u201d to the worms, she found. \u201cThey stopped moving.\u201d",
            "That \u201cwas surprising,\u201d Taylor says. Glycerol \u201cis actually an ingredient found in a lot of sunscreens,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not known to hurt people. But she\u2019s \u201cpretty sure\u201d it killed her planarians.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!5",
            "fCTaylor used these peels to create her banana extracts.",
            "In a later test, Taylor would notice that glycerol damaged planarians\u2019 skin \u2014 even with no UV exposure. Glycerol is used in many products. Taylor\u2019s work now suggests it might pose risks to aquatic life.",
            "But planarians survived just fine in the aqueous extract. And these outperformed the water-only group \u2014 the only other ones left alive, the teen says.",
            "Taylor confirmed this later when she stained those same planarians. She used a special dye. It stains damaged tissue so that it glows under her microscope\u2019s UV light. Basically, the more glow, the more damage there is.",
            "The three glycerol-exposed groups exhibited the most damage. The aqueous extract group showed the least. Where damage did show up, Taylor says, it looked \u201cspotty.\u201d That probably means a worm \u201cwas not fully coated.\u201d",
            "The next step is figuring out exactly what chemical provided the aqueous extract\u2019s UV protection. Identifying that, she says, could allow for a new class of eco-friendly, banana-based sunscreens.",
            "Regeneron ISEF is a program created and run by the Society of Science (which also publishes this magazine). Taylor was among 1,657 students \u2014 from 62 nations or territories \u2014 competing at the 75th annual ISEF. They shared in nearly $9 million in prizes."

In this way, it altered the fish\u2019s path. There\u2019s little evidence that narwhals normally eat much char. And winter, not summer, is their big dining season. So this video seems to show the whale and fish investigating one another.",

The third group experienced rapid finger motion, but all the fingers moved at once. Two other groups didn\u2019t use the robo-hand. One of these continued to practice the tricky pattern on their own. The final group just rested.",

These connections could help explain why the training improved the musicians\u2019 speed in their left hands, even though they only wore the device on their right.",
            "Doctors and researchers already use robotic devices similar to this one in therapy, notes Hatsopoulos. For example, a stroke often impairs movement on one side of the body. Using a robot to move an arm can help a patient get back their former range of motion.",

            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

The last eruption occurred about 600,000 years ago. Geologists think this one was massive. It emptied the caldera\u2019s magma chamber. Without magma to support it, the ground caved in.

            "In the past, machines have displayed 3-D objects by moving a flat screen up and down. Each 2-D slice of the object would be projected onto the screen at different heights. When the screen moves extremely quickly, those slices blur together. As a result, they look like one solid shape.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s like a real 3-D object. You can see it from all directions,\u201d says Elodie Bouzbib. She studies human-computer interactions at the Public University of Navarre. That\u2019s in Pamplona, Spain.",
            "One problem with past 3-D displays was that users couldn\u2019t touch the fast-moving screen without hurting their hand or damaging the device. To interact with the visuals they had to use a keyboard, 3-D mouse or some other indirect technique.",

            "The team tested strips of different materials to see which might work best. Some, like Spandex, stretched out too easily. Others, like plastic lanyards, hurt to touch when they whipped up and down. Still others, such as silicone, reflected too much light to clearly display projected images.",
            "In the end, strips of elastic \u2014 like those used in the waistbands of stretchy pants \u2014 won out. \u201cThey were a good compromise between all the properties,\u201d Bouzbib says. Two cameras tracked users\u2019 fingers within the display. This let the graphics respond to pinching, swiping, spinning and other gestures.",

You can touch those displays too, he points out. But it\u2019s hard to use levitation to make images bigger than about one centimeter (0.4 inch) across.",
            "The elastic-band display is 19 centimeters (7.5 inches) wide and 8 centimeters (3 inches) deep. That\u2019s about the size of a square Tupperware container. \u201cNow, people can start to experiment and play around with it,\u201d Fushimi says.

            "\u201cIf you want to make it bigger, it\u2019s probably going to face issues,\u201d Fushimi says of the elastic-band setup. \u201cImagine it room-sized. Then you can no longer reach through the display.\u201d In other words, it wouldn\u2019t work for building something like a Star Trek holodeck. But Fushimi could imagine it being scaled up to a desktop-sized device.",

            "These modular units start as floating, hexagon-shaped cells. Once deployed in the water, they can link together to make large ocean habitats.

No longer. The reef is now bleached white and dead.",
            "Dying coral is \u201cnot just a story that we can hear from newsletters or books,\u201d Ja Young says. For her, the problem can\u2019t be ignored. So she and Jiho teamed up to build a fleet of robotic apartment complexes for baby coral. It would provide them homes. And being mobile, they can move when storms threaten.",
            "Their work earned these juniors at Saipan International School a place here, last month, as finalists at the 75th annual Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF. Society for Science \u2014 which also publishes this magazine \u2014 created ISEF and still runs it. This year\u2019s 1,657 finalists came from 62 nations or territories. Together, they took home nearly $9 million in prizes.",

            "For this project, \u201cWe created everything,\u201d says Ja Young. \u201cWe 3-D printed everything.\u201d They chose materials that will break down in the ocean over time. That way, they won\u2019t pollute the environment if individual units separate and get lost.",
            "The duo tested their cells\u2019 ability to link up in a borrowed swimming pool in Korea, says Ja Young. \u201cAnd then we borrowed this wave-creating machine in order to make sure [their habitat won\u2019t] just float away.\u201d",
            "Their system consists of two types of cells. The first offers a safe harbor for coral larvae. They can attach to these \u201ccoral cells\u201d and grow. The second are power cells. These similarly shaped units can drive the coral-housing units. Each power cell \u201chas a propeller,\u201d Ja Young points out, and runs on solar energy. So power cells can motor coral cells to the perfect nursery location. Once they arrive, these cells can link together. A tether connects them to the ocean floor. This ensures they won\u2019t drift away.",

            "Their solution was to build an escape plan into their housing units. For example, Ja Young says, \u201cThere could be a typhoon coming.\u201d The undersea waves kicked up by such a storm could destroy the cells. \u201cWe cannot make the house not blow away,\u201d she says. But \u201cwe can make it run away.\u201d",
            "Their coral-housing units not only can move, but also decide when it\u2019s time to move.",

            "He linked the cells to the internet so they can receive ocean data. These include temperature readings and other weather updates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They use open-source data, which are freely available for all to use.",
            "Their system\u2019s motorized cells use these data to make decisions. If a dangerous storm looms, these cells will know. They can turn on their propellers and head for safer waters. An \u201calgorithm and the website itself can also designate a destination,\u201d says Ja Young.",
            "Even if people do nothing, these cells can execute an escape. Thanks to clever programming, the cells can pick their own destination. They also can calculate the best route. This escape feature sets their technology apart from other coral-transplant systems, says Jiho. Few such technologies can flee danger. And those that do need a lot of human help. Human labor makes them \u201cless efficient in both cost and time,\u201d Jiho says.",
            "Each cell costs about $120 to make, says Ja Young. That\u2019s far less than similar technologies. Most, he says, cost about \u201ca thousand times more.\u201d",

            "She\u2019d clearly suffered a major allergic reaction \u2014 but to what? She was 61 years old and didn\u2019t know of anything she was allergic to. So she went to an allergist who combed through her history for clues to what happened.",
            "One hint: Raley had recently had another bout of hives. That one erupted in the middle of the night \u2014 a sign that it had been a delayed reaction to something. And both times, the hives had occurred after she\u2019d cooked red meat: beef and pork.",
            "\u201cI have no idea if it\u2019s related,\u201d Raley finally told the allergist, but \u201ctwo months ago, I got bitten by a tick.\u201d",

Raley, however, had been bitten while hiking near her home in Olympia, Wash. Lone star ticks are found only east of the Rocky Mountains \u2014 thousands of kilometers (miles) away.",

More than eight in every 10 of them recalled being bitten by ticks before showing these symptoms. That raised scientists\u2019 suspicions that tick bites may have triggered the allergies.",

When these ticks bite, the sugar molecule and other compounds can get into someone\u2019s body. There, they can somehow make the immune systems go haywire.",
            "The next exposure to alpha-gal may trigger an allergic reaction in these people. Red meats and other animal products (such as milk and gelatin) are rich in alpha-gal. So those foods could incite that bad reaction.",

            "The delayed and often mysterious nature of a patient\u2019s stomach issues can make alpha-gal syndrome hard to diagnose, says Sarah McGill. As a gastroenterologist, she specializes in the digestive system. She works at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill.",
            "In the past, doctors hadn\u2019t considered food allergies when seeing adult patients with chronic digestive problems, she says. Why? Most food allergies develop when people are young. \u201cBut alpha-gal syndrome is very unique,\u201d she says. \u201cAdults can get it suddenly.\u201d And there\u2019s no cure \u2014 though some people may eventually be able to eat red meat again without issue.\u00a0",
            "Another problem: Many doctors and nurses have never heard of alpha-gal syndrome.",
            "In one U.S. survey of healthcare providers,\u00a0more than four in every 10 had not heard of the condition. Among those who had, about one in three didn\u2019t know how it was acquired.

Patients were sometimes told their symptoms were in their head, McGill says. \u201cI see that same pattern happening with alpha-gal syndrome.\u201d",
            "Increasing awareness among doctors and nurses could speed up diagnosis, Salzer says. That in turn could help patients feel better faster.",
            "It\u2019s hard to know just how many patients we\u2019re talking about. While alpha-gal syndrome appears fairly rare, exact numbers are hard to pin down. Salzer was part of a team that tallied about\u00a0110,000 suspected cases in the United States from 2010 to 2022. But this might be an undercount. As many as 450,000 people might have been affected during this time, those researchers say.",

            "For Oltean, that means avoiding tick bites. She knows that can be difficult, especially during tick season. Ticks are generally seeking blood meals from early spring to late fall, depending on where you live.",
            "After being outdoors, many people scan their bodies to ensure they\u2019re not carrying any ticks. Quickly finding and removing those tiny arachnids can keep them from spreading diseases. That\u2019s the case for Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A tick must latch onto someone\u2019s body for hours or days to transmit the bacteria that cause those illnesses.",
            "\u201cThat does not seem to be the case with alpha-gal syndrome,\u201d Oltean says. There are no bacteria being transmitted. Tick saliva is thought to cause the allergy. So it\u2019s possible that a single bite from a tick \u2014 even one yanked away at once \u2014 could spark the condition.\u00a0",
            "Suspected cases of alpha-gal syndrome cluster mostly in the southern, midwestern and mid-Atlantic United States. This map shows cases from 2017 to 2022. Cases are shown per 1 million people in the population per year. Areas with larger case counts are shown in dark blue.",

            "In cities that no longer add fluoride to drinking water, children experience more tooth decay, studies show.",
            "Warren Loeppky has been a kids\u2019 dentist for 20 years. Over the last decade, he\u2019s been seeing more tooth decay in his young patients. Not only is it more common, he says, but also more aggressive and severe. Many kids have so much damage that he has to put them under general anesthesia to repair their teeth.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s always sad seeing a young child in pain,\u201d Loeppky says. \u201cDental decay is very preventable. It breaks your heart to see these young kids that aren\u2019t able to eat.\u201d",
            "Many things can foster tooth decay. Diet and genetics can both play a role, Loeppky notes. Still, he believes part of the problem stems from a decision made in Calgary, where he works. In 2011, this Canadian city stopped adding fluoride to its drinking water.",
            "The decision \u201cwas surprising to the general public,\u201d says Juliet Guichon. But it was \u201cshocking and alarming to dentists, to pediatricians, to anesthesiologists and others in the healthcare field,\u201d she says. They \u201cknew what it would mean\u201d for children\u2019s health. Guichon is a legal and ethics scholar at the University of Calgary. She formed a group that pushed for putting fluoride back in the city\u2019s tap water.",
            "Fluoride is a mineral. Soil, water and many foods naturally contain low levels of it. It offers a safe and effective way to prevent tooth decay, studies have shown. It recruits other minerals, such as calcium and phosphate, to teeth. They strengthen a tooth\u2019s enamel, which fends off the acid made by mouth bacteria. Dental health can have a big effect on someone\u2019s overall health. That\u2019s why fluoride is added to toothpaste and other oral-care products.",

            "fCStudies have shown that fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and helps prevent tooth decay. This is why it\u2019s found in toothpaste, mouthwash and many other oral-care products.",
            "Many people also get fluoride from tap water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that communities add 0.7 milligrams of it for every liter of water. It\u2019s up to state and local governments to decide if they want to follow that guidance. In 2022, the CDC reported that nearly two in every three Americans received fluoridated water.",
            "But this water treatment practice is coming under new scrutiny.",
            "In March, Utah became the first state to ban water fluoridation. Florida followed suit in May. Many cities and towns across the country are considering it. And on April 7, one federal official said he would tell the CDC to stop recommending this water treatment.",
            "To understand the impacts of such a move, some researchers have studied public health effects in places that no longer add fluoride to water. Calgary is one such city. Juneau, Alaska, is another. It stopped this water treatment in 2007.",
            "The data may offer a cautionary tale for other cities and towns. Science News spoke with researchers and other experts in both cities. They described what can happen when local governments opt to stop adding fluoride to drinking water.",
            "Lindsay McLaren says she never expected to end up studying fluoride. At the University of Calgary, she studies how public policies can affect people\u2019s health. She hadn\u2019t thought much about fluoridation \u2014 until 2011. That\u2019s when the Calgary City Council decided to stop adding fluoride to the city\u2019s water.",
            "The move gave McLaren an idea for a study. She\u2019d look at how the dental health of local children fared once fluoride was gone.",
            "She recruited dental hygienists to inspect the mouths of second-graders. Some went to schools in Calgary. Others went to schools in Edmonton. It\u2019s a city in the same province that\u2019s roughly the same size. And it still added fluoride to its water.",
            "In Calgary, the team surveyed second-graders about seven years after water fluoridation had ended. So these kids likely had never been exposed to fluoride in their drinking water. Of 2,649 children, 65 percent had tooth decay. That\u2019s nearly two in every three. In Edmonton, 55 percent of the 2,600 surveyed children had tooth decay.",
            "On a population level, that difference is \u201cquite large,\u201d McLaren says.",
            "\u201cCompared to Edmonton kids, Calgary kids were now considerably worse as far as dental health goes,\u201d McLaren says. Her team looked at other factors, such as diet, social measures and family income. But none of these, she says, could explain the differences between dental health in the two cities\u2019 kids.",
            "And the number of kids with decay wasn\u2019t the only difference. More kids treated for tooth decay-related problems had to be placed under general anesthesia in Calgary than in Edmonton. That finding comes from an April 2024 study in the Canadian Journal of Public Health. It suggests the decay in these kids may have been more severe or extensive. From 2018 to 2019, 32 out of every 10,000 children in Calgary were put under general anesthesia to treat tooth decay. In Edmonton, it was roughly half as many.",
            "The findings don\u2019t surprise local dentists, says Bruce Yaholnitsky. He specializes in gum disease and other mouth issues in Calgary. \u201cThis is just obvious to us. But you need to have proper science to prove, in some cases, the obvious.\u201d",

He claimed the evidence about the safety of low levels of fluoride was not conclusive. That left the commission\u2019s members split at 3\u20133.",

            "The team compared dental claims made before and after the city stopped using fluoride. They found a big effect on children under age 6. In 2003, when fluoride was still present, these kids had an average of 1.5 procedures to treat tooth decay. In 2012, five years after fluoride use stopped, this number had risen to 2.5 treatments per child.",

            "One reason why that statement was controversial: That dose is more than double what the CDC recommends adding to water.",
            "And authors of this review couldn\u2019t tell if lower levels \u2014 like those found in treated U.S. drinking water \u2014 affect kids\u2019 IQ. Plus, that correlation is not causation. Seeing a lowered IQ does not prove that higher levels of fluoride caused it. Indeed, that warning is noted on the program\u2019s website.",
            "Meyer cautions against making decisions \u201cbased on weak or misrepresented evidence.\u201d Choosing to stop adding fluoride, she says, \u201cis not a precaution, it\u2019s negligence.\u201d",
            "Juneau still doesn\u2019t add fluoride to its water. But in 2021, 62 percent of Calgary residents voted to bring it back. That\u2019s more than voted in 1989 to first put fluoride in Calgary\u2019s water. Legal scholar Guichon says McLaren\u2019s study helped get people to vote for it.",
            "\u201cMore people voted to reinstate fluoride than voted for the mayor. So that\u2019s a success,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cBut in America, we are entering a dark time.\u201d"
