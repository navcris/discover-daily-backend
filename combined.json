            "Sleeping in on the weekends \u2014 as long as it\u2019s not for more than two hours \u2014 may improve mental health in teens.",
            "For many teens, Saturday mornings are a time to snooze. After a week of getting up early, the weekend brings a chance to catch up on much-needed slumber. And sleeping in on the weekend may reduce anxiety, a new study finds \u2014 as long as teens don\u2019t tack on more than two extra hours of shut-eye.",
            "It might seem like a good idea to get as much sleep as possible on the weekend. Sleep is essential for a fully functioning brain and body \u2014 especially for adolescents. And 75 percent of American teens don\u2019t get the recommended eight to 10 hours per night. School, homework and other weekday activities require them to rise early. Teens\u2019 circadian rhythm also makes it difficult to fall asleep before 11 p.m.",
            "Yet past research has hinted that too much sleep on the weekend can lead to health issues. Those studies had found a possible connection between catch-up sleep and depression. But the link hadn\u2019t been carefully studied. What\u2019s more, no one had looked at another major aspect of mental health \u2014 anxiety \u2014 in relation to sleep.",
            "That got Sojeong Kim curious. Kim is a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Oregon in Eugene. She set out to investigate how catch-up sleep might be related to anxiety.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Kim used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. This study has \u00a0been following thousands of kids and teens from across the United States to learn how their brains develop over time.",
            "For her study, Kim focused on data collected from teens when they were 12 to 15 years old. That\u2019s around the age that people start having trouble getting enough sleep, she explains. It\u2019s \u201charder for teens to fall asleep early and wake up in the morning.\u201d",
            "The data included sleep and activity patterns for nearly 1,900 young people. These data came from a Fitbit each participant wore during the study. Participants had also filled out questionnaires about their feelings of anxiety and depression. Kim studied those, too.",
            "Teens who slept in on weekends reported the lowest symptoms of anxiety, but only if they got less than two hours of extra shut-eye. Teens who didn\u2019t sleep in \u2014 or lost sleep on the weekend \u2014 reported higher anxiety levels. Those who slept more than two additional hours had the highest anxiety symptoms of all.",
            "Anxious teens experienced neck tension \u2014 a common sign of stress. They also reported excessive worries, fears and guilt.",
            "Kim shared her findings at the SLEEP 2025 conference in Seattle, Wash., on June 11.",
            "\u201cThe results show a possible link between sleeping a little more on weekends and feeling less anxious,\u201d says Christopher Depner. \u201cBut we still need more research to know for sure.\u201d Depner, who was not involved in the work, studies sleep and circadian rhythms at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
            "One limit of the new research is that it was an observational study, Depner says. An observational study is one where researchers simply observe something happening in the world. They don\u2019t set up an experiment and control variables to test a hypothesis about how it works.",
            "\u201cThe scientists just watched how people sleep without asking them to try any new sleep habits or treatments,\u201d Depner points out. Having people follow different sleep schedules and then measuring their mental health could help clarify how one affects the other.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "If there is a link between just the right amount of catch-up sleep and anxiety \u2014 why? What would make someone who gets more than two hours of extra sleep more anxious?",
            "Kim suspects that having big swings between weekday and weekend sleep schedules creates what scientists call social jet lag.",
            "Like jet lag triggered by traveling between time zones, social jet lag causes grogginess and a foggy brain. It happens when our body\u2019s clock is out of sync with our sleep cycle. Switching from too little sleep to too much is a known trigger. Although Kim\u2019s study didn\u2019t investigate this as a cause, she suspects it\u2019s part of the problem.",
            "Kim didn\u2019t find a clear link between catch-up sleep and symptoms of depression. That might be due to the age group Kim studied. \u201cUsually, depressive symptoms onset later in adolescence,\u201d she says. Anxiety, on the other hand, tends to start when teens are younger. Kim\u2019s next step is to study weekend catch-up sleep among older teens.",
            "For now, she wants teens to know there can be benefits to catch-up sleep. \u201cGetting a little extra sleep on weekends might help [you] feel less anxious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not too much, because it can give you the opposite effect.\u201d"

            "In colder regions in the fall, many kinds of trees no longer make food energy with their leaves. As the leaves lose their green pigments, other pigments become visible, providing a beautiful autumn show.",
            "Objective: Separate the different pigments in tree leaves",
            "Areas of science: Chemistry, Plants",
            "Time required: 1\u20132 days",
            "Key concepts: plant pigments, paper chromatography, leaves",
            "Credits: Teisha Rowland, PhD, Science Buddies; Svenja Lohner, PhD, Science Buddies",
            "Have you ever wondered why leaves change from green to an amazing array of yellow, orange and red hues during the fall?",
            "Leaves get their brilliant colors from pigments made up of various color-creating molecules. During the warm, sunny months, plants use their leaves to turn sunlight into food energy, a process called photosynthesis. This primarily uses a pigment that reflects green light, which gives the leaves their characteristic color. In autumn, when colder, shorter days arrive, many kinds of trees no longer make food energy with their leaves and, consequently, no longer need the green pigment. The leaves\u2019 other pigments \u2014 some of which were already there during summer \u2014 become visible.",
            "In this science activity, you will uncover these hidden colors by separating plant pigments with a process called paper chromatography. What colors will you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/YxOSHj_kVlA?feature=oembed",
            "In this science activity, let\u2019s use paper chromatography to uncover the hidden pigments lurking in tree leaves.",
            "Because some plant pigments can stain, be careful not to spill your colored solutions when throwing them away.",
            "Even though a plant leaf looks like it is mostly one color, it is actually made up of a mixture of pigment molecules. In this activity, a scientific technique called\u00a0paper chromatography\u00a0was used to separate the individual color pigments. You should see different colors at different locations as you go along one of the paper towel strips, and the order in which the colors appear should be roughly the same among the different color solutions you tested.",
            "What are the different bands of color on the test strips? These are the different pigments in the leaves. The ones you may see on your paper towel strips are: green chlorophyll, yellow xanthophylls, orange carotenoids and red anthocyanins. Pigments travel along the paper strip based on their interactions with the paper strip and the isopropyl alcohol solution. Pigments that are more attracted to the paper strip than the isopropyl alcohol stay near the bottom of the strip, where the solution was first \u201cpainted\u201d onto the pencil line. Pigments that are more attracted to the alcohol than the paper strip usually travel farther up the strip. Because the color of the leaf depends on the mixture of pigments in it, different colored leaves will display different colors on their paper towel strips. For example, very green leaves may not have any red colors (anthocyanins) on their strips.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/TtAENPSThI4?feature=oembed",
            "Want to know more about paper chromatography? Science Buddies explains.",
            "There are many types of pigments in plant leaves. Chlorophyll makes them look green and helps carry out photosynthesis during warm, sunny months. As fall arrives and the green, food-making color fades, other pigments such as yellow, orange and red ones become more visible.",
            "Xanthophylls are yellow pigments, and carotenoids give leaves an orange color. Photosynthesis also uses these pigments during the summer, but chlorophyll, a stronger pigment, overpowers them. These pigments take more time to break down than chlorophyll does, so you see them become visible in fall leaves. They are also found in carrots, daffodils, bananas and other plants that have these vibrant colors.",
            "There are also anthocyanins, intense red pigments that are not made during the summer, only appearing with the final group of the fall colors. These molecules also give the red hue to apples, cranberries, strawberries and more.",
            "Although a leaf is a mixture of these pigments, you can separate the colors using a method called\u00a0paper chromatography. In this method, a mixture (such as your pigment mixture) is applied onto a chromatography paper. The paper strip is dipped into a liquid, called the solvent or mobile phase. The liquid will start traveling up the paper strip and carry all the components within the mixture (such as your different color pigments) along through the chromatography paper. While traveling up the paper, each component interacts with the paper and the solvent differently depending on its chemical properties. Some of them are more attracted to the paper, whereas others prefer to stay in the mobile phase. As a result, each individual component travels along the paper at a different speed. This is how with paper chromatography a colorful mixture of pigment molecules can be separated into each individual pigment component.",
            "You can learn more about paper chromatography in the video above. The video gives an overview of what paper chromatography is, shows how it is done, explains the separation processes involved and also provides tips and tricks for troubleshooting your experiment.",

            "With their humanlike digestive tracts, vampires would probably starve in real life. That\u2019s because our bodies evolved to rely on a wide array of foods that includes vegetables, meat and grains. ",
            "Vampires have been stalking the human imagination for centuries. These fictional creatures take many forms, including the famous Count Dracula and Morbius of the Marvel Universe. But most share one feature: long, razor-sharp teeth. These fangs help vampires bite the necks of victims to feast on their blood.",
            "Many real bloodthirsty creatures exist in nature. Vampire bats are perhaps the most famous. Mosquitoes and ticks also make the list, as do some spiders and moths. But it would be hard to turn a human body \u2014 even an undead one \u2014 into a blood-drinking monster.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe can\u2019t survive the way vampires do,\u201d says David Begun. This paleoanthropologist studies how apes, including humans, evolved. He works at the University of Toronto in Canada. In real life, no primates survive on blood, Begun notes. To do so, vampires would need to rework both the mouths and guts that humans inherited from our plant-eating ancestors.",
            "In popular media, vampires puncture skin using knifelike upper canine teeth. Humans occasionally use their canines to tear food, too. But any vampire would probably struggle to reliably break skin. \u201cOur canines are completely unsuited to piercing anything,\u201d says Begun. \u201cThey look more like incisors, our front teeth.\u201d",
            "Human canines have slowly shrunk over time. Like many primates today \u2014 including our close cousins, chimpanzees and gorillas \u2014 our ancestors once sported large, pointed canines. These impressive teeth would have even sharpened themselves by rubbing against neighboring molars.",
            "But anthropologists suspect that these flashy teeth weren\u2019t primarily for eating. Instead, ancient apes probably used them to intimidate rivals and defend themselves. Over time, these teeth grew smaller as our ancestors evolved to live in cooperative groups. Less fighting between males left little need for such large canines.",
            "Vampires would have to revert to big canines, says Begun. Those teeth would also need to be much sharper, more like the teeth of the only real blood-drinking mammals: vampire bats.\u00a0",
            "These blood sippers use their two front incisors to create tiny incisions in their prey. Unlike human teeth, these incisors don\u2019t have enamel. This allows them to remain permanently sharp and to not wear down over time. \u201cNo primate has such sharp canines that would allow that kind of thing to happen,\u201d says Begun.\u00a0",
            "*A_close-up_image_shows_a_common_vampire_bat_face_The_bat_sports_brown_fur,_pointed_ears_and_small_bl",
            "fCUnlike their fictional counterparts, vampire bats (such as the one seen here) don\u2019t suck blood. Instead, these nocturnal predators use their upper incisors to pierce skin. Saliva containing anticoagulants then enters the wound, which prevents blood from clotting. The small bats then use their tongues to lap up the oozing blood. ",
            "Even movies that show vampires growing sharp canines at will would be unrealistic. If taken care of, our permanent teeth don\u2019t change much over the course of our lives. Instead, the size, number and shape of our teeth are all preset by our genes.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cThere are rodents that have continuously growing incisors,\u201d says Begun. Beavers, squirrels and rats are a few examples. \u201cBut they can\u2019t do it at will.\u201d In fact, these rodents must grind their teeth or gnaw on hard items such as wood and bone to keep them short. If left unchecked, overgrown incisors can interfere with eating, injure their mouths and even grow through their skulls.",
            "Finding ways to draw blood from victims isn\u2019t the only hurdle real-life vampires would face. They\u2019d also need to be able to digest it \u2014 and use that food as fuel for their undead activities.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Blood isn\u2019t particularly nutritious. Low in calories, it\u2019s mostly made up of water and protein. Because of their humanlike guts, any vampire would probably suffer from malnutrition or even poisoning.\u202f",
            "\u201cHumans can\u2019t survive on blood alone,\u201d says Begun. \u201cWe need a lot more diversity of nutrients, of vitamins and minerals, that aren\u2019t present in blood.\u201d\u00a0",
            "That\u2019s because we inherited our digestive systems from a long line of omnivores, or animals that eat both plants and other animals. Like today\u2019s chimpanzees, our ape ancestors would\u2019ve likely eaten mostly plants with an occasional helping of meat, says Begun. Long, coiled intestines probably helped them break down tough plants. And bacteria in their guts likely helped further digest this food and absorb nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "By about 2.5 million years ago, our ancestors started eating more meat. Later, humans started cooking with fire. That made digesting foods such as meat and tough plants much easier. Even more recently, people began growing starches such as grains to eat.\u00a0",
            "This led to tweaks in our digestive tracts. We started producing extra enzymes that could break down starches. Meat and other easy-to-digest foods could be broken down in shorter intestines. This resulted in bodies best suited to eating many different foods, says Begun.\u00a0",
            "Even vegans who don\u2019t eat any animal products must have a varied diet. \u201cThey can\u2019t just eat lettuce all day long,\u201d Begun says. \u201cThey have to have beans. They have to have rice. They have to have complete proteins.\u201d ",
            "While low in most nutrients, blood does contain lots of iron.\u00a0Red blood cells hold about 70 percent of the iron in our bodies, where it helps carry oxygen to organs. But consuming too much iron can be toxic to humans, who have no way to digest or excrete large amounts of it. This iron overload can damage body organs, the nervous system and even cause death.",
            "Unlike humans, vampire bats have evolved ways to digest blood. Research suggests that vampire bats lost a gene that blocks intestinal cells from absorbing too much iron. Those gut cells are also short-lived and regularly shed. This lets the bats quickly absorb lots of iron and discard it through their waste. Meanwhile, their gut bacteria help break down proteins. These microbes may also produce extra vitamins not found in blood.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Scientists are still trying to understand why vampire bats started feeding on blood. Some suspect the habit arose from bats that fed on parasites such as ticks. Perhaps the bats eventually started feeding on the blood oozing from wounds left behind when they scarfed down these pests.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Whatever led bats to their taste for blood, it\u2019s clear humans weren\u2019t shaped by those same evolutionary pressures. And changing how a real species eats usually requires tens of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution. That\u2019s a lot more involved than the single bite needed to make a fictional vampire.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Still, this reality shouldn\u2019t stop movie-goers from enjoying vampires, Begun says. \u201cIt\u2019s still OK to enjoy a vampire movie or a vampire TV show, even if it\u2019s not actually feasible.\u201d"

            "The chemical is known as DEHP. That\u2019s short for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. It\u2019s a member of a family of chemicals used widely in our daily lives. Indeed, all of us carry trace levels of DEHP and other phthalates (THAA-laytz) in our bodies.",
            "These chemicals are often added to plastics to make them softer and more flexible. DEHP, a very common member of this family, shows up in a huge range of everyday products, such as shower curtains, raincoats, toys, car upholstery and shoes. It\u2019s also in food packaging and medical supplies (including blood bags).",

            "See the broad range of products that contain DEHP and the many health effects that have been linked to this phthalate.",
            "Leonardo\u00a0Trasande and his team at New York University\u2019s medical school in New York City probed for a possible link between DEHP and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The leading cause of death worldwide, CVD includes all diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Among them: clogged arteries (a source of heart attacks), stroke, heart failure and more.",
            "To start, the NYU team gathered estimates on DEHP exposures across the globe. These data came from 216 studies published between 2000 and 2023. The studies measured, in people\u2019s bodies, amounts of chemicals made when DEHP breaks down. Called metabolites, such chemicals indicate how much DEHP people were exposed to.",
            "Next, the team looked at how CVD deaths and DEHP exposures had changed over the years. They compared DEHP data from 2008 with death rates from CVD 10 years later among people 55 to 64 years old. From this, they calculated what share of those deaths globally seemed to trace to this phthalate.",
            "More than 2.6 million CVD deaths were recorded for this age group in 2018. The new study links 13.5 percent of them to this plasticizer.",
            "The new data do not prove DEHP caused all of these deaths. The NYU team only found a link between the two. That\u2019s a correlation \u2014 not proof yet that it caused these deaths. However, if the link is shown to be causal, that would be quite troubling: It would come to more than one in every eight CVD deaths worldwide.",
            "Another caution: People encounter a mix of phthalates daily. In the new study, however, \u201cour model was not able to take this into account,\u201d says Sara Hyman of the NYU team. The group\u2019s analysis also didn\u2019t account for other factors that might play a role in heart disease, such as diet, exercise or other medical conditions. \u201cMore research is needed,\u201d she says, to also account for these.",

            "Changcheng Zhou is a biomedical scientist at the University of California, Riverside, who studies what causes cardiovascular disease. And he finds the death rate being linked to DEHP \u201cquite alarming.\u201d",
            "That rate varied greatly across the globe. About three in every four of those deaths linked to DEHP occurred in the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific. That might be due to the large and growing plastics industries in those parts of the world, the NYU team suggests.",
            "Future studies could refine these estimates further, the scientists say. Some national health surveys collect data on phthalate exposures. This is true in the United States, Canada and many nations in Europe. Elsewhere, such as in Latin America, Africa and Asia, such national monitoring is lacking, Hyman says. So her team\u2019s estimates of DEHP exposure in those places are based on far fewer people. As such, she notes, links to DEHP in these places might be slightly less precise.",
            "Different phthalates may affect different processes in the body. And they might not operate alone. \u201cYou do need to study the effect of the mixture\u201d of phthalates people encounter regularly, says Mahua Choudhury. She studies environmental risks to our genes at Texas A&M University in College Station. Some phthalates, she notes, could lessen \u2014 or worsen \u2014 the health effects of others.",

            "Phthalates can enter the body when you eat food that had been sold, stored or heated in plastic. We also breathe them in from the air and absorb them through the skin. Once inside the body, they can tinker with hormone action. Previous research has also linked phthalates to diabetes, obesity, pregnancy complications \u2014 and yes, heart disease.",
            "Also quite troubling: One 2020 study linked pregnant moms\u2019 DEHP exposure with mental risks in their children \u2014 such as a lower IQ. Another study linked school-age kids\u2019 exposures to DEHP with a lower IQ \u2014 especially in boys. A more limited IQ risk emerged for dibutyl phthalate (DBP). It\u2019s another plasticizer and solvent. It\u2019s used widely in making PVC plastic, inks, adhesives and cosmetics.",
            "Prenatal exposure to DEHP and DBP also has been linked with lowering a boy\u2019s preference for certain types of play, such as playing with toy guns. It also made boys more likely to engage in gender-neutral types of play \u2014 think puzzles or sports. No such change was seen in girls.",

            "Hail forms high in the clouds during a storm. There, some raindrops freeze solid. As more and more raindrops collide, an icy \u201cstone\u201d grows in size until it\u2019s too heavy to remain aloft.",
            "Particularly large or dense hailstones can damage human-made structures and objects, such as buildings and cars. Zach Lebo knows this firsthand. A meteorologist, he works at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. His parents in Pennsylvania had to replace their home\u2019s roof twice in the last 10 years due to hail damage.",
            "Researchers are hoping to better understand some of the mysteries of hail. One big question is how hail moves through the atmosphere and builds up in size. Some hailstones have measured more than 13 centimeters (5 inches) across. That\u2019s larger than a softball!",
            "fCHail comes in all sizes. It can be tiny bits of ice that melt almost immediately. Or it can be softball-sized chunks that persist for quite a while.",
            "Scientists used to think that hailstones grew by taking a looping path through the atmosphere. Think of their path as upward and downward like a merry-go-round tipped on its side. But such looping motions are actually rare, scientists in China have now shown. They analyzed hailstones collected by citizen scientists.",
            "Since 2016, people had been collecting hailstones across 15 provinces in China. These citizen scientists gathered more than 3,000 of these bits of ice and stored them until people on Qinghong Zhang\u2019s team could retrieve the hail. An atmospheric scientist, Zhang works at Peking University in Beijing. The best place for citizen scientists to store hail is, not surprisingly, a cold place, she says. \u201cThey put the hailstone in their freezer at home.\u201d",
            "Her group analyzed the chemistry of some of that hail. First, they sliced the stones, which allowed them to see layers of ice inside. The researchers then analyzed the specific isotopes of oxygen present in the frozen water within each layer. By matching that chemistry with the properties of the atmosphere at different heights, they could estimate the paths each ice ball had taken through the sky.",
            "Only 1 out of the 27 analyzed hailstones appeared to have moved like a tipped-over merry-go-ground. That was unexpected, says Zhang. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising.\u201d",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Studying the shapes of hailstones also can help reveal how each hailstone forms. Hail is seldom perfectly spherical, says Becky Adams-Selin. She\u2019s a hail scientist who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, and works at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, an environmental consulting company. Some hailstones sport lobes, she notes, and others can have lumps: \u201cYou can get all sorts of weird shapes.\u201d",

            "Over the spring and summer of 2025, Adams-Selin has been part of a team collecting hail samples from across the United States. The researchers have traveled across the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains and the Central Plains. This area includes Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas. And it\u2019s known for producing big storms that regularly spew hail. The project is called ICECHIP (short for In-Situ Collaborative Experiment for the Collection of Hail in the Plains).",
            "ICECHIP instruments measure things such as the air temperature, rainfall and the force with which hail strikes the ground. Adams-Selin also developed a device to store hailstones as the team drives around. \u201cIt\u2019s like a giant funnel that collects hail and funnels it into a battery-powered freezer,\u201d she explains, until they get back to the lab.",
            "Hailstones are a window into the atmosphere, says Liye Li. She\u2019s a meteorologist with the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. It can be hard to directly observe where hail forms, she explains. \u201cWe\u2019re blind to what\u2019s happening inside the clouds.\u201d But hailstones deliver clues about what\u2019s going on high in the sky right into scientists\u2019 hands.",

Trees occur along rivers and streams that may cut through the plains.",

These vast plains provide good pasture for livestock. The region is home to herd animals such as saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) and Przewalski\u2019s horses (Equus przewalskii). Predators \u2014 such as the corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) \u2014 also hunt here, feeding on birds and other small prey.",

As air from the west moves up and over the mountains, water vapor condenses and falls as rain. This leaves the air on the eastern side \u2014 the \u201crain shadow\u201d side \u2014 very dry. This dry air descends to the plains below and cannot support forests. But it does support grasses, which form the steppe.",
            "Grazing herd animals make their home here. The American bison (Bison bison) is one example. Pronghorns (Antilocapra americana) are another. Pronghorns are the fastest land animals in North America. They sprint up to 96 kilometers (60 miles) per hour. That\u2019s fast enough to keep pace with many cars.",
            "Sometimes, humans turn steppes into farmland. Crops that tolerate the dry climate \u2014 such as wheat, barley, and oats \u2014 thrive for a while. However, once the natural grasses get plowed under, the region can become even drier. Soil nutrients can dwindle without natural vegetation to anchor them in place. This can reduce crop production over time.",

Although most are harmless to people, a few strains can cause serious disease. Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",

Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",

It\u2019s in a gene that reduces the odds that a bean pod will break open. For farmers who want to easily harvest whole beans, that\u2019s a useful trait. But it\u2019s not very helpful for wild plants, which rely on their pods bursting to spread seeds.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "All three mutations seen in farmed beans began to spread around 10,000 years ago. That was long before people started farming the plants in Japan.\u00a0",
            "Since these traits are of little help in the wild, Lee says, their early spread may reflect human preferences. Red has long been considered lucky. What\u2019s more, the Jomon people are known to have used red coloring in their pottery.\u00a0",
            "The new findings bolster the idea that the Jomon people were more than foragers. They could have been shaping their perfect red bean, eventually domesticating it between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago. Fossils had already offered some evidence for that, Lee notes. Finally, he notes, there \u201cis evidence from plant genetics, too.\u201d\u00a0",

            "A genome is an organism\u2019s complete set of genetic instructions.",
            "For most living things, genetic instructions come in the form of DNA. This molecule contains the instructions to build and maintain living things. In most living things, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes. Some of the DNA in a chromosome consists of genes. These are segments of DNA that carry instructions for making an organism\u2019s proteins (and a few other molecules).",
            "But genes only make up a fraction of an organism\u2019s genome. Most of the genome is made of non-coding DNA. Non-coding DNA doesn\u2019t contain genes. Scientists once called it \u201cjunk DNA.\u201d That\u2019s because it was believed to have no function. But it turns out that non-coding DNA helps the organism in other ways, such as allowing a cell to use and read the code in its genes.",
            "Most human cells carry one entire genome \u2014 46 chromosomes arranged in 23 pairs. But exceptions exist. Red blood cells are one example. Once mature, red blood cells lack DNA altogether. Egg and sperm cells also do not contain a full genome. These cells carry half a genome \u2014 in humans, that\u2019s 23 chromosomes each. When an egg cell and a sperm cell fuse, they create one new cell with a full genome of 46 chromosomes. A complete human genome contains about 25,000 genes and many non-coding regions.",
            "Some viruses use RNA as their genetic material instead of DNA. Viruses are not alive in the same way as a cell. However, we still refer to their complete RNA instructions as a genome.",
            "Genetic material \u2014 both DNA and RNA \u2014 is made of units called nucleotides. They are represented by the letters A, T, G and C (RNA replaces T with U). DNA\u2019s nucleotides occur in pairs, called base pairs. A human genome consists of about 3 billion of these base pairs. Combinations of these base pairs provide all the instructions for building a living thing.",
            "Genome size varies from one species to another. For example, the Japanese canopy plant\u2019s (Paris japonica) genome is about 50 times bigger than a human\u2019s. A complete set of this plant\u2019s DNA consists of 149 billion base pairs. If we stretched out the DNA from one cell, it would extend about 100 meters (330 feet). In contrast, a human genome would extend only about 2 meters (6.5 feet).",
            "On the other hand, the single-celled green algae called Ostreococcus tauri has a very short genome. It contains only about 12.6 million base pairs. Its DNA \u2014 if stretched out \u2014 would extend only about 8 millimeters (0.3 inch).",

            "A pickleball wrapped in a balloon inspired a new adjustable surface that could one day reduce drag on airplanes, submarines or other vehicles.",
            "Some people see a pickleball and want to smash it. When Anchal Sareen saw some pickleballs lying around a lab a few years ago, she thought about submarines and airplanes. As a mechanical engineer who studies how fluids affect movement, she couldn\u2019t help it. So she went right out, bought a balloon and wrapped it around the pickleball. It became the inspiration for a new surface to speed and steer aircrafts and underwater drones.",
            "The surface has dimples, like a golf ball. But they\u2019re adjustable. Add air and the dimples smooth out. Remove air and the dimples deepen.",
            "In a pair of recent papers, Sareen and her team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor have now shown how dimple depth can alter drag. Drag is the friction-like force that slows things down as they travel through a fluid. They\u2019ve also shown how changing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dimples can help steer an object through air, water or other fluids.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a cool idea,\u201d says Christopher Douglas at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Drag is a big challenge, he says. \u201cAnything you can do to minimize drag is great,\u201d says this mechanical engineer who did not work on the new skin.",
            "*a_grey_3d_printed_sphere_is_lit_from_the_bottom_to_show_the_dimples_",
            "fCThe dimples on this sphere can be made deeper or shallower. Their depth affects drag. Here, the sphere is hanging in a wind tunnel for testing.",
            "Douglas studies fluid flow as a way to improve the systems that propel vehicles. Engineers, he notes, have long been altering surface roughness to reduce drag.",
            "But drag isn\u2019t always a bad thing, he adds.",
            "Fins and rudders guide a ship by increasing drag in one place more than in another. This nudges a ship in a desired direction. And dimples might help here, too, says Sareen. She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",
            "They tested these plastic models in wind tunnels to identify how dimple depth affected drag.",
            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/De2VQYkdztM?feature=oembed",
            "Anchal Sareen and her team explain how they used soft robotic technology to develop dynamic surface dimples \u2014 ones that can change at different flow speeds \u2014 to cut the drag experienced by underwater vehicles. It should also allow them to maneuver without fins and rudders.",
            "They\u2019re also developing tests to see if the design would work in real-world conditions, such as the skin of some vessel sailing through air or water.",
            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",
            "\u201dA lot of people have asked me, \u2018Are you planning to patent this as a golf ball which can stay in the air?'\u201d Sareen laughs and says: Not any time soon."

Today, this fossil is offering insight into a fungus that\u2019s become famous for hijacking its victims\u2019 brains. The ancient insect\u2019s demise suggests such fungi have been\u202finfecting ants twice as long as scientists had thought.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Right before an infected ant dies, it will have a sudden urge to leave its nest and climb up onto a high leaf. There, it will bite down with a death grip. In one final gory moment, the fungus will then explode from the ant\u2019s back.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "That blast releases spores that can now infect the fungus\u2019 next victims.\u00a0",
            "How these fungi infect insects and control their behavior is fairly well known. But little had been known about when this bone-chilling behavior first began. Why? The soft bodies of fungi hardly ever become fossils. Even rarer, the researchers note, is finding a fossil insect with the fungus still inside.\u00a0",

It seems that ancestors of\u202ftoday\u2019s \u201czombie fungi\u201d were already infecting multiple groups of insects back then, says Conrad Labandeira. This paleontologist did not take part in the new study. He works at the National Museum of Natural History. It\u2019s in Washington, D.C.\u00a0",
            "The ant and fly fossils suggest Ophiocordyceps evolved alongside its victims, says Zhuang.\u202fThe oldest fossil ant ever found is 113 million years old. So fungi might have been infecting the ancestors of ants almost since they first appeared.\u00a0",
            "The ant in the newfound fossil was a pupa. During this stage of an ant\u2019s life, it can\u2019t move, Zhuang notes. So the fungus was likely not controlling this ant\u2019s behavior.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Many of us have eaten something that left us sick. \u201cNot only is it terrible in the moment, but it leads us to not eat those foods again,\u201d notes Christopher Zimmerman. He\u2019s a neuroscientist at Princeton University in New Jersey.",

            "Mice usually need an immediate reward or punishment to learn something, notes neuroscientist Richard Palmiter. He works at the University of Washington in Seattle. Even one minute\u2019s delay between cause (say, pulling a lever) and effect (getting a treat) can be too long for mice to learn the two are related.",

            "When an animal eats, POMC neurons kick off a cascade of activity. They send messages to other groups of brain cells that give a sense of feeling full. That feeling tells the animal to stop eating.",
            "When the mice were offered sugar, though, a different pathway out of the POMC lit up. \u201cWe found that the POMC neurons, which tell us how full we are, are also quickly turned on when [mice] see signs of sugar,\u201d says Min\u00e8re.",

Indeed, Ventura\u2019s team reported earlier this year, \u201cThe majority of sunglass lenses in [its new] study inadequately filtered harmful UV radiation, leaving eyes susceptible to long-term injury.\u201d",
            "Knowing that not all sunglasses are the same, we can look at how these different filters work.",

            "Light travels as a jumble of waves. \u201cThink of sunlight as a bunch of waves vibrating in all possible directions,\u201d Ventura says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call unpolarized light.\u201d When sunlight hits an especially reflective surface, though \u2014 such as water or the hood of a car \u2014 much of the light will reflect in just one direction. Usually, it\u2019s horizontal.",
            "The randomly focused light is known as polarization. Polarized light vibrates in just one direction.",
            "Most reflections from horizontal surfaces polarize light. We experience this as glare. However, reflections are not the only way to polarize light. Certain filters can polarize light, too. And these polarizers explain the glare-diminishing effects of some sunglasses.",
            "\u201cVery clever guys in the past thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we intercept the pathway of polarized light [through the lenses of sunglasses]?\u2019\u201d explains Jos\u00e9 Toschi. An optical engineer, he directs research at Suntech Supplies in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. There, he helps design eyewear, including sunglasses.",
            "*an_illustration_showing_how_polarized_lenses_change_block_horizontal_light_waves",
            "fCPolarized lenses allow vertical light waves (here drawn as light green) to pass through while blocking horizontal light waves (here drawn as orange) \u2014 the ones that cause glare.",
            "This approach applies filters to the lenses. These filters contain molecules lined up next to each other. They create a pattern that resembles a picket fence. \u201cTogether, these molecular lines work [to block out glare],\u201d Toschi says.",
            "Here\u2019s how it works. Imagine passing a rope through an opening between two pickets in a fence. Tie one end to a tree. On the other side of the fence, move the free end of the rope up and down. The vertical waves that this creates in the rope can slide through the opening of the fence. Wave the rope from left to right, however, and the waves will become horizontal \u2014 and won\u2019t pass through the fence. The direction of the waves no longer aligns with the openings between the pickets.",
            "This is exactly what happens with polarized sunglasses. The filter\u2019s tiny molecular lines act like the pickets in the fence. When light waves try to pass through the glasses\u2019 lines, only the vertical waves make it through. All horizontal waves \u2014 the glare \u2014 get blocked out.",
            "With that glare now removed, colors appear more vivid and everything looks clearer. The same will not happen with sunglasses that are merely tinted. Their lenses simply reduce how much overall light reaches your eyes.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/1Z6rXEl2agk?feature=oembed",
            "Without polarized sunglasses, we\u2019re unable to see the crocodile hiding in the water; it becomes visible when the water is viewed through polarized sunglasses.",
            "If you\u2019re uncertain whether your tinted sunglasses are polarized, take this simple test.",
            "Look at a screen \u2014 such as the one on a smart phone \u2014 while wearing the glasses. As you tilt your head or the phone, the screen\u2019s color might change or even darken. If it does, congratulations: You\u2019re wearing polarized lenses.",
            "This works because the lens\u2019 filter is \u201cblocking some of the light,\u201d explains Ventura. And how much it blocks will change as you tilt the phone\u2019s screen.",
            "However, Toschi notes, polarizing lenses alone aren\u2019t enough to protect our eyes. The sun\u2019s UV rays can lead to more than short-term discomfort.",
            "For instance, one study in rabbits found that repeated exposure of their eyes\u2019 cornea \u2014 the clear, outermost layer \u2014 to UV rays reduces the amount of antioxidant enzymes. The paper cautions, this \u201cvery probably contributes to the damage of the cornea (and possibly also deeper parts of the eye)\u201d due to highly reactive oxidants.",
            "Protective lenses should also filter out UV light. And that\u2019s not one wavelength but a spectrum of them. They fall into two bands of light known as UV-A and UV-B.",
            "\u201c[Good] lenses should be able to block the whole spectrum,\u201d Toschi says. \u201cSo, when one buys sunglasses, one should demand the UV400 certificate from the vendor.\u201d It confirms that these glasses contain a coating that blocks the entire UV-A and UV-B spectrum \u2014 wavelengths that span from 280 to 400 nanometers.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ME1v5ST0yeQ?feature=oembed",
            "An eye doctor explains the many risks to our eyes from exposure to the sun\u2019s UV rays in all seasons \u2014 even on cloudy days. Not-so-fun fact: Up to 10 percent of skin cancers occur on eyelids \u2014 yet another reason to wear protective glasses. Learn which types of eyewear protect best.",
            "Sunglasses have been used for centuries. But as new technology emerges, so do new designs.",
            "For instance, not all light passes through sunglasses\u2019 lenses on its way to your eyes. Some can come around the sides, Ventura notes. Some glasses are now being designed to prevent sunlight from entering through frame edges.",
            "\u201cBut the research that excites me the most on polarized lenses is nanocoatings,\u201d Ventura says. \u201cThese use ultra-thin layers that block glare, UV, fog and reflections all at once.\u201d",
            "Some of these new lenses are even being sold as \u201csmart.\u201d They can adjust their polarization, for instance, so you get less glare when you\u2019re outdoors but more light when you\u2019re indoors.",

A tau is similar to an electron and carries a negative charge. An anti-tau carries a positive charge. Just like in a typical atom, attraction between opposite charges would hold tauonium together. But unlike other atoms, it would not have strong force.",

This is a type of atom that lacks protons and neutrons. It is made of an electron and a positron. Think of a positron as a positively charged electron. A positron is to an electron what an anti-tau is to a tau. Like tauonium, the pull between opposite charges binds this atom together.",
