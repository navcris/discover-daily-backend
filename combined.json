            "Pluto and its largest moon\u2019s meet-cute may have started with a kiss.",
            "New research shows the dwarf planet and Charon may have paired up in a \u201ckiss-and-capture\u201d collision. That\u2019s when two bodies briefly collide before settling into their current positions.",
            "Pluto and Charon had an instant connection, says Adeene Denton. \u201cThey kiss and they say: \u2018Yeah, this is it. I want to build a system together with you.\u2019 And then they do.\u201d",
            "Denton is a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colo. She was part of the team that shared these results January 6 in Nature Geoscience.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Of Pluto\u2019s five moons, Charon is unusually large. It\u2019s half Pluto\u2019s size and has a little less than one-ninth as much mass. Since the 1990s, planetary scientists have thought that Charon could have formed in a way similar to Earth\u2019s moon. Some impact on Pluto might have splashed out hot, molten material, which then began orbiting around it. Eventually that debris could have come together, forming a large moon.",
            "But, just as with Earth\u2019s moon, details of that possible scenario have been fuzzy. \u201cIt goes: Something hit Pluto,\u201d Denton says. Then \u201cquestion mark, question mark, question mark \u2014 Charon is now there.\u201d",
            "Past computer models of such collisions seemed to yield a system like Pluto and Charon. But those models treated the rocky, icy bodies as fluids. They ignored their material strength. And that would have been a decent assumption for large objects, such as gas giants or galaxies. When something hits them, those do behave like fluids. But Pluto and Charon are ice-wrapped rocks. And, it turns out, you can\u2019t ignore that.",
            "The real Charon-forming collision would have been a lot less splashy, Denton says. So in her team\u2019s models, the researchers included Pluto\u2019s and Charon\u2019s rocky cores and icy mantles and crusts. And then it turned out that the protoplanets had an instant connection.",
            "In the new models, Pluto and Charon joined up and rotated together, with each body remaining basically intact. After about 30 hours of contact, Charon would have separated from Pluto. Then, it likely would have migrated into the orbit it has around Pluto today.",
            "The researchers found that two other pairs of Kuiper Belt objects could also be explained by such \u201ckiss-and-capture\u201d collisions. One is the dwarf planet Eris and its moon Dysnomia. The other is the dwarf planet Orcus and its moon Vanth.",
            "Denton plans to extend her team\u2019s new work to other objects with different masses and makeups. \u201cCan this still work? I\u2019m pretty confident that it does,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d she adds, \u201ckiss-and-capture happened all over the Kuiper Belt in the solar system\u2019s history.\u201d And that, she concludes, would seem \u201cvery romantic.\u201d",

The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, recently spotted the event.\u00a0Astronomers described what they\u2019ve gleaned from those entrails here on January 14 and 15 at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.",
            "\u201cIf this is true, it\u2019s super cool,\u201d says Mercedez L\u00f3pez-Morales of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. She\u2019s an astronomer who was not involved in the new work. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d she says, \u201cyou can study directly what the interior of an exoplanet is made of. That\u2019s exciting.\u201d",
            "The exoplanet \u2014 K2 22b \u2014 was discovered in 2015. It sits scorchingly close to its star, completing an orbit in just nine hours. It\u2019s too small to be seen itself. However, it periodically emits\u00a0clouds of opaque dust. They\u00a0create a cometlike tail that blocks a small share (less than 1 percent) of its host star\u2019s light.",
            "Astronomers soon realized that the dust was probably cooled magma from the exoplanet\u2019s interior. This trail of planetary viscera offered a unique chance to tease out the chemical composition of K2 22b\u2019s mantle. (That\u2019s the material right below a planet\u2019s crust.)",
            "Getting clues to any planet\u2019s mantle, even Earth\u2019s, is challenging, says Jason Wright of Penn State in University Park. He\u2019s an author of the new study. And, he notes, \u201cWhen nature gives you a gift like that, you have to take it.\u201d",
            "Wright was part of a team that observed K2 22b with JWST\u2019s sensitive mid-infrared spectrometer last April. Different minerals in the dust emit particular wavelengths of light. This allowed the team figure out what the exoplanet is made of.",
            "The dust doesn\u2019t seem to be pure iron. That\u2019s what scientists would have expected if the planet was a bare core with no mantle or crust jacketing it. \u201cThere is still meat left on the bones, so to speak,\u201d said astronomer Nick Tusay. He was describing the planet January 14 at the meeting.",
            "Something in the dust emitted light that was hard to link to any specific material, he said. His team first checked to see if the dust grains were magnesium oxide and silicon monoxide. Those are what you\u2019d expect in mantle material. But the emitted light didn\u2019t fit these minerals.",
            "Surprisingly, the dust looks most like nitric oxide and carbon dioxide from vaporized ices, Tusay said. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, what we\u2019re looking at is a snowball disintegrating.\u201d",
            "Those gases are hard to explain for a planet so close to its star. \u201cIt\u2019s just so weird and unexpected,\u201d Tusay said. In an attempt to learn more, he has requested more JWST observing time.",
            "He and his team have also\u00a0reported their results in a paper\u00a0submitted January 14 to arXiv.org. This is a website where new data are stored and can be viewed prior to peer review.",
            "L\u00f3pez-Morales agrees that more observations are needed to confirm the planet\u2019s makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s very preliminary, very promising, definitely needs more data,\u201d she says. Studying a handful of other known disintegrating exoplanets would be interesting, too.",
            "A newly discovered disintegrating planet might be the best place to start. The space-based TESS telescope discovered this new planet in October. It\u2019s emitting a dust cloud so big that it extends halfway around its host star in a horseshoe-shaped tail some 9 million kilometers (5.6 million miles) long. Astronomer Marc Hon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0reported this at the meeting on January 15.",
            "This is the closest disintegrating planet to Earth yet discovered. For that reason, its contents will be even more clear in JWST\u2019s data.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve proved we can do it with K2 22b,\u201d Tusay says. \u201cThis one will be better.\u201d"

            "For James Whitfield, math is not something to dread. In fact, in college he often turned to math problems to relieve stress. He\u2019d relax by solving equations from a textbook his mother gave him. \u201cI enjoyed doing mathematics just for fun,\u201d says Whitfield.",
            "At the time, Whitfield was studying chemistry and math. A quantum chemistry course showed him how to combine his two interests. This branch of chemistry uses quantum mechanics to study how molecules interact. Quantum mechanics is a type of physics that deals with the behavior of matter at atomic and subatomic levels. The work allowed him to put his love of math to use, he says. \u201cThat made going into quantum mechanics a lot of fun.\u201d",
            "That solid background in math let Whitfield explore quantum computing during his Ph.D. Still, few opportunities for practicing quantum computing existed outside of academia at the time. But now that has changed. Today, his team develops new quantum computing tools at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. He\u2019s also working with Amazon Web Services to help deliver training on the Amazon Braket quantum computing service.",
            "Finding ways to boost computing power through quantum mechanics has become \u201cthis worldwide phenomenon,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t go into it expecting that to happen. It was being at the right place at the right time.\u201d In this interview, Whitfield shares his experience and advice with\u202fScience News Explores. (This interview has been edited for content and readability.) \u00a0",
            "The first thing is that there\u2019s a quantum [computing] industry at all. The fact that it\u2019s become a worldwide effort that people are putting time and effort into. Now, quantum computing is happening in government, private industries and academia. It\u2019s really all over the place. \u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s also been amazing to watch how the technology has developed. I think it gives a whole different feel to some of the technologies we use, such as Wi-Fi, the internet and computers. It\u2019s incredible seeing technology that started as just ideas on paper grow into something that\u2019s being implemented. Seeing all those scientific successes and challenges makes it really interesting and fun to be a scientist.\u00a0",
            "When it comes to math, a lot of people get into a situation where they need to pass a course. They start doing poorly, and then they start feeling bad about it. Then they perform even worse, and it becomes this self-fulfilling cycle. They start believing they\u2019re not good at it. \u00a0",
            "Mathematics is very particular and has a lot of rules. It includes a lot of complicated things you have to memorize and work through. But so are other things we like to do for fun. Many people enjoy things that are very close to mathematics. Doing Sudoku puzzles, playing video games or completing crossword puzzles are all in the same vein. They\u2019re just fun puzzles that keep your mind sharp. \u00a0\u00a0How mathematics is taught can also be really problematic. Throwing students into algebra while they\u2019re still figuring out how to add or multiply is not the best approach. Especially for those who won\u2019t use those skills later on. Pushing them to do something very difficult when they\u2019re not prepared makes it a stressful situation. It does a lot to dampen the enjoyment of mathematics. Most people don\u2019t need to do intensive calculus for any particular reason other than for fun. \u00a0\u00a0If you timed or graded people doing Sudoku, it wouldn\u2019t be fun to do either. Sudoku and crossword puzzles are quiet, Sunday afternoon kinds of games. Doing mathematics that way makes it a much richer experience.\u00a0",
            "This may sound hard, but try to enjoy it. Shying away from difficult things isn\u2019t the right way to get through them. When I did sports in high school and college, I sometimes found it very difficult. Waking up early, running, going to competitions \u2014 I chose to do all of those things. You don\u2019t do sports because it\u2019s easy but, rather, because it\u2019s difficult. And I think in many ways, you can think of mathematics in the same way.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Also, try not to be too stressed about it. If you\u2019re interested in science, some math is involved. But you don\u2019t have to be a mathematician. Not loving math doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be involved in science. \u00a0",
            "When it comes to science, there\u2019s a lot of self-drive that needs to be there. You\u2019ve got to have some passion to make it through. It\u2019s really hard to just stumble through a Ph.D. You won\u2019t get much out of it. \u00a0\u00a0A Ph.D. is a very long process. If you don\u2019t want to do five years of study, don\u2019t do it. But if you do, pick something you\u2019re passionate about. But if you want to get a job sooner rather than later, I don\u2019t suggest doing [a Ph.D.]. Instead, try a master\u2019s degree or a certificate program and then learn on the job. That\u2019s because a job market that\u2019s here now can change during the time it takes to finish a Ph.D. \u00a0\u00a0Here in America, there are many routes to getting an education. If you didn\u2019t enjoy your high school classes, there\u2019s community college. If you\u2019re not enjoying community college, there are trade schools and online certificates. Even YouTube can be a fantastic place to learn skills if you watch the right videos. The internet has a wealth of knowledge \u2014 but only if you go to the right places. Otherwise, you end up in things that are not healthy intellectually.\u00a0",
            "I often encourage my students to go down rabbit holes. I try to do that, too. Learn as much as you can about what you find interesting. I spent the past month implementing a theorem from the 1960s just because I thought it would be fun to do. It was something really nice to learn and share with my group. They can then add or take away from it. I get my best ideas by sharing science and having fun exploring.\u00a0"

            "Static electricity is a buildup of electric charge. That buildup can happen when two objects bump or rub against each other. Electrons transfer from one object to the other. The object that receives electrons becomes negatively charged. The object that donates them becomes positively charged.",
            "Objects with opposite charges attract each other. You might have seen this effect if you\u2019ve ever rubbed a balloon against your head. The balloon picks up electrons from your hair \u2014 leaving it positively charged and the balloon negative. As a result, when you pull the balloon away from your head, your hair tends to cling to it. Clothes cling together after tumbling around in the drier for the same reason.",

            "The Pleistocene\u2019s climate shifts are similar to what we might see in the future, says Daniel Fortier. A geomorphologist, he works at the University of Montreal in Canada. There, he studies Earth\u2019s changing features.",

            "The researchers also studied minerals in sediments above the ice. The alignment of magnetic minerals in it had flipped, they realized. This pointed to a time roughly 770,000 years ago when the Earth\u2019s north and south magnetic poles swapped spots. That clue indicates the newfound ice is at least that old. Previous research had dated the fossil forest below the glacier to at least 2.4 million years old. So that\u2019s the maximum age of this ice.",
            "The find, Fortier says, shows how resilient permafrost is. Computer simulations of what the future climate may look like suggest that permafrost will completely thaw in many regions by the end of this century.",
            "But this preserved glacier has persisted through interglacial periods that were warmer than today, he notes. As such, he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think permafrost will disappear so fast. The system is more resilient than we think.\u201d"

            "Afterward, patients were shown 100 more pictures. These included pictures they had seen in the first part of the experiment. There were also pictures they had never seen. The patients were asked to touch the picture they were most familiar with.\u00a0\u00a0",

In picture memory tests, the patients\u2019 memories for images paired with the small jolts improved by 35 to 40 percent. Their memory did not improve for pictures not paired with the zaps.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",
            "*a_wall_with_three_bricks_that_look_like_they_have_faces",
            "fCCan you see the three faces in this image? Most people can easily find them. Most people also realize that they aren\u2019t real faces. They are an example of pareidolia.",
            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo?feature=oembed",
            "This video was part of a famous 1999 study into inattentional blindness. While you watch it, count the number of times people in white shirts pass a basketball.",
            "Partway through the video, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the players. Did you see it? About half of all viewers who count passes while watching the video miss the gorilla completely.",
            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",
            "*a_woman_sitting_on_a_chair_looking_at_a_ghost_twin_image_sitting_in_front_of_a_window",
            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Many students study by reading their notes and textbooks over and over again. Research studies show there are more effective ways to use your valuable study time.",
            "As a teen, Faria Sana often highlighted books with markers. \u201cThe colors were supposed to tell me different things.\u201d Later, she recalls, \u201cI had no idea what those highlighted texts were supposed to mean.\u201d",
            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",
            "Nate Kornell \u201cdefinitely did cram\u201d before big tests when he was a student. He\u2019s a psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",

            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",

            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else.

            "The immune system retains memories of the infections it fights. That helps it know what to do when it encounters familiar germs in the future. But measles wipes clean those memories. The resulting \u201cimmune amnesia\u201d from measles can\u00a0leave people at risk of developing infections from other harmful viruses and bacteria for years, scientists are finding. Pneumonia, ear infections and diarrhea are common side-effects. \u00a0",
            "That makes measles \u201cthe furthest thing from benign,\u201d says Michael Mina. As a pathologist, he studies infectious diseases at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. Measles increases people\u2019s susceptibility to everything else, he says. And that has big costs.",
            "Scientists now have a better picture of how the measles virus mounts its sneak attack. They know which cells are most at risk and how long the immune system seems to suffer. Studies helped fill in the details. They came from tests in lab animals and in human tissues and from comparing children before and after they had measles.",

The amount of virus, or viral load (shown as a beige curve behind the bodies), peaks between 7 and 10 days after infection. Afterward, the body is left with fewer memory immune cells. Source: B.M. Laksono, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands ",
            "This new view may help explain why the measles vaccine seems to have far-reaching effects. The shot prevents deaths \u2014 and from more diseases than just measles, says Rik de Swart. He\u2019s a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. By shielding the immune system from one virus, the vaccine may help keep other disease-causing germs at bay.",
            "After someone with measles coughs or sneezes, their virus can linger in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. Once inside its next victim, that virus attacks immune cells. It targets those in the nose, throat, lungs and eyes. These immune cells have a protein called CD150 on their surface. This protein allows the virus to invade, experiments on lab animals show.",
            "Inside the cells, the virus quickly makes copies of itself. Then it spreads to places packed with other immune cells, such as the bone marrow, the spleen, tonsils and lymph nodes. The measles virus has an \u201cenormously strong\u201d preference for infecting immune cells, says Bert Rima. He is an infectious-disease researcher at Queen\u2019s University Belfast in Northern Ireland.",
            "By looking at preserved human tissue, Rima and his colleagues traced how measles invades the immune system. Eventually, newly made viral particles move to the respiratory tract. From there they can\u00a0be coughed out to sicken more people. The researchers described their findings in the May/June 2018 issue of mSphere.",
            "A severe measles infection usually lasts several weeks. It can sometimes bring ear infections and pneumonia. In rare cases, a deadly brain swelling may also occur. On their own, those are worrisome side-effects, says Anthony Fauci. He is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. But the loss of immune cells also can leave people prone to infections that the immune system would normally fend off.",
            "In 2013, de Swart and colleagues had a chance to study the immune effects of the measles virus in children. These kids were part of a closed-off community of Orthodox Protestants in the Netherlands. Parents in this community refuse to let their kids become vaccinated. As a result, bouts of measles have been common. The community\u2019s last measles outbreak had ended in 2000. So it was just a matter of time before the virus took hold again.",
            "The researchers got permission from parents to take blood samples from healthy children who never had measles. They wanted to study their immune cells. Then, the researchers waited for an outbreak. They would test the kids again after an infection.",
            "And they didn\u2019t have to wait long. An outbreak ripped through the community just as the researchers began collecting blood. Classrooms emptied as sick siblings packed into dark living rooms to protect their sensitive eyes. De Swart\u2019s team had blood samples from before and after 77 of those children came down with measles.",
            "The measles virus targets immune cells called memory B and T cells, de Swart says. These cells remember threats the body has already fought off. They also help the immune system spring into action quickly if those threats return. After the measles outbreak, the numbers of some types of the memory cells dropped in children who had caught the disease. That created an immune amnesia.",
            "De Swart\u2019s team reported its findings November 23, 2018 in Nature Communications.",
            "The immune system might take months, or even years, to bounce back from this memory loss. Researchers, including de Swart and Mina, compared health records of children in the United Kingdom from 1990 to 2014. For up to five years after a bout of measles, children experienced more infections than did those who never had the disease. And children who\u2019d had measles were 15 to 24 percent more likely to receive a prescription for medicine to treat an infection. The findings were reported last November 8 in BMJ Open.\u00a0",

            "Mina and his colleagues found similar results for deaths from nonmeasles infections among children in England, Wales, the United States and Denmark. When measles was rampant, children were more likely to die from other infections, the researchers found. And this added danger from measles stuck around for a long time. Even several years out, measles survivors were more likely to die from other infections than did children who had not gotten measles.",
            "At some point, the immune system can recover its memories. But it\u2019s not clear how. With new methods that can measure these memories, Mina and others hope to figure that out.",

            "Matthew Motta is a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He studies science communication and the public-policy impacts of people rejecting science. Recently, he and others surveyed 1,310 U.S. adults on their knowledge of autism. Some websites wrongly appeal to parents\u2019 fears that childhood vaccines may cause the complex brain condition \u2014 even though study after study has shown that there is no link. Motta\u2019s group also asked how these people felt about government requirements that all children get vaccines.",
            "More than a third of the people surveyed claimed they knew as much or more about the causes of autism than either doctors or scientists. In fact, the opposite was true. People who thought they knew more than the experts generally knew the least about autism. That overconfidence was also strongest among people who oppose vaccines.",

            "\u201cSome people have so little knowledge about a subject that they actually don\u2019t know how much knowledge they lack,\u201d Motta explains.

After all, science is about facts. And someone\u2019s personal beliefs won\u2019t change the facts.",
            "The new findings don\u2019t mean that overconfident people are stupid, Motta says. They may even know a lot about things other than vaccines. And telling people that they\u2019re idiots would never change their minds anyway.",

She rejected mounds of scientific evidence showing that vaccines are safe. \u201cHer only response was: \u2018That\u2019s what they want you to think,\u2019\u201d Lindenberger said at a March 5 congressional hearing in Washington, D.C.",
            "When talking about vaccines with someone, such as a parent, don\u2019t give up, Motta urges teens and tweens. \u201cMake an effort to connect with your parents,\u201d he suggests. \u201cTalk with them on their own terms,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile staying true to the science.\u201d",

            "Measles is extremely contagious. And one number, or rather a range of them, sums up the risk of its spread.",
            "Two diseases have dominated headlines in the past few months. Measles sickened at least 1,044 people\u00a0in the United States between January 1 and June 13. The virus has shown up in 26 U.S. states. And in the African country of Congo, Ebola has\u00a0racked up 2,084 cases\u00a0since August 2018. Of those, 1,405 people have died. This outbreak has also spilled over into neighboring Uganda.",
            "Those numbers are scary. But another number illustrates how contagious a disease is. Really, it\u2019s a range of numbers. It\u2019s called the basic reproduction number, or R0\u00a0(pronounced \u201cR naught\u201d). This ratio describes how easily an infectious disease can spread.",
            "Every infectious disease has a basic reproduction number, or R0. This is the average number of people who would catch the bug from one infected person, in a population where no one is immune to the disease.",
            "Each dot in this graphic represents a person who would catch the disease from an infected person. R0 is usually expressed as a range because the factors that go into this ratio vary depending on the time and place of an outbreak.",
            "*060819_ht_measles_scivis_inline1_730png",
            "fCCredit: T. Tibbits; Sources: P. Fine/Epidemiol. Rev. 1993; S. Hay et al./Philos. T. R. Soc. B 2013; G. Chowell and H. Nishiura/BMC Med. 2014",
            "If one person is sick in an unvaccinated population, R0 estimates how many others that person would infect, on average. Researchers\u00a0can use R0\u00a0to estimate\u00a0how big an outbreak may become. They also would use it to plan a response if terrorists had found some\u00a0way to turn a disease into a\u00a0weapon.",
            "Every infectious event or outbreak has an R0. Three main variables go into calculating it. The first is how long people stay contagious once they\u2019re infected (the number of days, for example). The second is how often an infected person is likely to come into contact with others on a daily basis. And the third variable is the likelihood of infecting those people. In turn, those variables are influenced by other factors. Those include the local environment and the average age of infected people. An\u00a0R0 also can be affected by how closely people live to each other and things such as what public-health resources are available to them.",
            "Within epidemics, R0\u00a0can vary from\u00a0country to country. If there\u2019s more than one way to catch a certain disease, R0 also can vary between the\u00a0transmission routes. That\u2019s why when scientists talk about the R0\u00a0for a disease, they\u2019re usually talking about a range of numbers.",
            "For measles, that range is 12 to 18: One person is likely to sicken 12 to 18 others. That\u2019s high compared to something like Ebola. There, one person may infect another 1.5 to 2.5 people.",
            "That might seem surprising when you consider how many people Ebola has killed. But R0\u00a0measures how contagious something is, not how deadly it is.",
            "Part of what affects this\u00a0R0 is how a disease spreads between people. Measles can travel through the air. Ebola instead spreads through bodily fluids. So the odds of making contact with the Ebola virus is far lower.",
            "David Smith is an epidemiologist, or disease detective, at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cWith measles,\u201d he explains, \u201cif you\u2019re anywhere near someone with the disease, you could get it.\u201d That\u2019s why getting the measles vaccine is so important.",
            "Researchers also can use the R0 to figure out what share of people needs to be vaccinated to prevent a disease from spreading. This is known as herd immunity.",
            "For measles, generally 92 to 95 percent of a population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Because Ebola has a lower R0\u00a0range, it also has a lower herd immunity threshold. Estimates suggest that only 42 to 63 percent of a population would need\u00a0to be vaccinated\u00a0to reach herd immunity against Ebola. Current vaccines are not 100 percent effective against all of Ebola\u2019s various strains. Because of this, some researchers\u00a0argue that the threshold may actually be higher\u00a0\u2014 and that current vaccination efforts won\u2019t get us there.",
            "The R0\u00a0range is not perfect. Researchers\u00a0described\u00a0its flaws in the January 2019\u00a0Emerging Infectious Diseases. For one thing, people don\u2019t always define R0 in the same way. So even researchers may misinterpret what it means. And R0\u00a0can\u2019t tell you how well a vaccine or other control is working while an outbreak is underway. For that you\u2019d need to look at another reproduction number, called R effective or Rt. This number changes during an outbreak.",
            "Using R0 to describe an epidemic \u201cisn\u2019t great,\u201d Smith acknowledges. The number assumes everyone\u2019s immune system is encountering the disease for the first time and there are no vaccines. In an epidemic, that\u2019s rarely true.",
            "Measles\u2019 high R0\u00a0shows why it\u2019s good that there\u2019s a vaccine. Before one became widely available in the 1960s, millions of people got the measles each year \u2014 and hundreds of them died."

When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",

He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often."

            "In geology, avulsion refers to a river or stream changing course over a short period of time. In medicine, avulsion means the tearing or pulling away of tissues in the body.",
            "River avulsions create new channels, or paths that water flows through. This changes the landscape around a river in several ways. In a full river avulsion, all the water in a river reroutes. This leaves behind a dry river channel as water takes a new path.",
            "Partial avulsions change the land differently. In a partial avulsion, the river splits. For example, a single river channel may split into several. If these channels reconnect downstream, this could create a braided river pattern, with several channels weaving together. Over time, this creates many small islands throughout the river.",
            "River avulsions can even help form new land. The Mississippi River Delta is one example. This 3-million-acre (12,000 square kilometers) area of coastal Louisiana stretches into the Gulf of Mexico. (If Louisiana looks like a foot, consider the delta the toe.) As the Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico, it deposits sand and mud.",
            "The landscape near the delta is very flat. This means the river changes its path often. For instance, a flood might wash sediment into a channel, blocking waterflow. The river adjusts, searching for a new, easier route to the ocean. With each avulsion, new mounds of sediment form. This process extends the delta further into the sea.",
            "Medical science uses a second definition for avulsion. In medicine, avulsion describes an injury where body tissues are torn or pulled apart. One kind of avulsion injury is an avulsion fracture. This happens when part of a bone separates from the rest of the bone.",
            "Avulsions can lead to dangerous floods that threaten rural communities.",

Some of those fragments start out as magma \u2014 molten rock from deep within the Earth. When magma leaves the volcano, it becomes lava and begins to cool. Blobs of lava thrown into the air turn into lava bombs. Some of these blobs have solid rock at their cores. Others contain gas bubbles. Still others are molten rock, through and through.",
            "Geologists consider a blob of lava to be a lava bomb if it is at least 6.4 centimeters (2.5 inches) across and rounded. That is, as long as it has no sharp angles. Lava bombs can be mostly round, like basketballs, or elongated, like footballs. Sometimes strings of lava stretch to form ribbon-shaped lava bombs. And lava bombs can get big. The largest one ever recorded was a whopping 6 meters (20 feet) across.",
            "Lava bombs can spend up to 10 seconds soaring through the air before landing. As the lava encounters the cold air of the atmosphere, it cools and hardens from the outside in. Smaller lava bombs can cool completely before landing. Larger ones only harden on the outside. This creates a solid coating that cracks like the crust on a loaf of bread. When the inside of a lava bomb is still hot and squishy when it hits the ground, it can land with a splat \u2014 flattening out like a cow pat.",
            "Most lava bombs land within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of an eruption. But some travel as far as 10 kilometers (6 miles). Of all threats posed by a volcanic eruption, researchers estimate, lava bombs are the most dangerous to people.",

He was part of a team that shared its new findings November 1 in\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
            "Astronomers in China and Japan first noted this supernova in 1181 as a \u201cguest star\u201d in the sky. But modern astronomers didn\u2019t find the remains of that explosion, now called the Pa 30 nebula, until 2013.",
            "When they did find the remnant, it looked weird. The supernova appeared to be a kind called type 1a. This type of stellar explosion involves a white dwarf star\u00a0blowing up and destroying itself in the process. But in the case of Pa 30, part of the star survived.",

            "The system is structured \u201ckind of like a three-layered onion,\u201d Cunningham says. The inner layer is the star. Then there\u2019s a gap of one or two light-years, which ends in a spherical shell of dust. The final layer is the filaments, which emerge from the dust shell.",
            "How the filaments formed remains a mystery. Also unclear is how those spikes have managed to stay in such straight lines for centuries.",
            "Maybe a shock wave from the explosion ricocheted off the wispy material between this star and its neighbors. As the shock wave bounced back toward the white dwarf, it could have sculpted the material into the spikes astronomers see. But future studies will have to confirm or rule out that scenario."

He got the idea to use scent for detecting allergens by just watching an ant in his kitchen home in on sugar from afar. \u201cEven the smallest things can spur good ideas.\u201d",
            "Being completely new to your project area can actually be a good thing, Samvith says.

            "When microbes break down plant materials, such as cellulose, they release carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. The researchers decided to compare the CO2 output of microbes dining on the new microplastic to when they ate cellulose.",
            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year.

            "Polyurethane is sometimes used to coat natural fibers, like wool and cotton, for clothing, Erdle says. Over time, that plastic coating flakes off, \u201cfragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces and never going away.\u201d Having something that can readily be broken down by bacteria, she says, is better than \u201chaving persistent plastic in the environment.\u201d",

            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, CO2 works like a blanket. It traps heat, warming our climate. Humans add a lot of CO2 to the air when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, for energy. Carbon capture can reduce this climate-warming CO2 pollution.",
            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

To his surprise, \u201cher arteries were totally normal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut her heart function was dramatically reduced.\u201d In takotsubo syndrome, the heart vessels are often clear. In fact, most patients do not have classic risk factors for heart problems.\u202f\u00a0",

            "When Needham raised the purchase age for tobacco products, regular cigarettes were the main concern. The law significantly cut smoking among Needham\u2019s high schoolers compared to those living nearby. When older teens were no longer able to legally buy cigarettes, that curbed their own use. It also knocked out a main supply of cigarettes to younger kids.",
            "It\u2019s now possible to buy e-cigarettes illegally online. That makes it harder to restrict sales, Boykan says.",
            "Another approach that has helped is a campaign called The Real Cost. It\u2019s run by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This campaign has boosted awareness of the harms of nicotine, vaping and smoking among teens and tweens, research has shown. It also has made young people less open to tobacco products.",

            "fCElf Bar e-cigarettes are the most popular brand among U.S. teens and tweens who are currently vaping.",
            "In one research trial, more than 1,500 13- to 17-year olds watched videos on vaping. Some were prevention ads by The Real Cost. Those clips centered on health risks or addiction problems related to vaping. Other participants watched neutral videos about vaping.",
            "Teens who watched The Real Cost ads were less curious about vaping than those who watched neutral videos. This Real Cost group also was less open to smoking.",
            "Reports of serious lung injuries and deaths related to vaping have gotten people\u2019s attention as well. Cases of vaping-related injuries peaked in September 2019. By January 2020, almost 2,700 people had been hospitalized for such injuries.",
            "One survey of 11th and 12th graders found these vaping injuries increased their view that vaping was risky.",
            "Nicotine pouches are now the second most popular tobacco product among teens and tweens, the new NYTS reports. Some 480,000 middle and high school students used them in 2024. These small pouches hold a powder containing nicotine, appealing flavorings and other ingredients. When a user places one between their lips or cheeks and their gum, nicotine seeps into their bloodstream through the lining of their mouth.",
            "The number of teens and tweens using nicotine pouches stayed steady from 2023 to 2024. That\u2019s worrying, Boykan says. It seems these pouches are \u201cnot perceived as harmful.\u201d",
            "Vapes that look like a gaming devices or smartphones pose a new risk, too. Some come with games styled after classics like Tetris and Pac-Man. One brand offers a virtual pet that the user feeds by taking puffs, plus a puff-count competition game.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/uNpLRiduF8c?feature=oembed",
            "The new nicotine pouches \u2014 widely used by teens \u2014 try to appear safe by including little more than the addictive agent in tobacco: nicotine. But for a teen\u2019s developing brain, nicotine itself is a risky drug \u2014 one that can have lasting impacts. That\u2019s why some officials hope to make pouch use restricted to adults.",
            "These devices are not legal in the United States. The new devices are \u201ccombining gaming \u2014 which is already a concerning addiction \u2014 and vaping, in a way that is really scary,\u201d Boykan says.",
            "Boykan wants teens and tweens to know that the nicotine in tobacco products poses a \u201creally significant\u201d risk to the adolescent brain. Nicotine can impair brain development, leading to a rewiring that may damage a teen\u2019s ability to think and focus.",
            "When Boykan talks to young people, she asks them about their dreams and goals. A nicotine addiction can get in the way of those plans. \u201cI can point them to videos of kids who had to drop out of college,\u201d She says, \u201cbecause they were so addicted.\u201d"

            "Dandruff makes the scalp itch, but it\u2019s not a dry skin problem. Treating it may call for a change in how often you wash your hair, use of an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo, or even turning to a prescription shampoo. ",
            "Dandruff flakes on your hair or shoulders don\u2019t look good. The itchy scalp that comes with it is no fun, either. In fact, although dandruff shows up on your hair, the condition actually starts with your scalp.",
            "Dandruff is a type of dermatitis (Der-muh-TY-tis), or skin inflammation. One study estimated that half of us will at some point develop this condition. And one key time it may emerge is puberty.",
            "Everyone\u2019s scalp hosts a mix of microbes. This is known as its microbiome (MY-kroh-BY-ohm). Sometimes the normal proportion of some types to others gets messed up. This is known as a dysbiosis (Dis-by-OH-sis). In people with dandruff, certain types of yeast and bacteria are far more common, compared to people with healthy scalps.",
            "Amy McMichael\u00a0and others discussed some of the culprits in a July 2024 report in the Archives of Dermatological Research. She\u2019s a dermatologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Both are in Winston-Salem, N.C.",
            "People often make the mistake of thinking an itchy, scaly scalp is dry, McMichael says. If they add oil, though, they risk making matters worse. Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",
            "Hair-care practices might explain some of the difference, McMichael says. She and others have found differences in how often women of African and European ancestry shampoo their hair. Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",
            "And also use hair conditioners, McMichael advises. \u201cIt actually smooths the outer layer \u2014 the cuticle \u2014 much better than you can get with oil.\u201d Be careful about using hair sprays and gels, she adds. These can dry hair, increasing the risk that strands will break.",
            "In any case, if you notice a hair or scalp problem, talk to your doctor or another health-care expert right away. You might need help for dandruff. Or you might have a more serious skin or hair condition.",
            "\u201cThe earlier that you come in, the better off you are,\u201d McMichael says."
