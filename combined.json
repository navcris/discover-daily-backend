Most of the male\u2019s organs melt away. Only the male\u2019s reproductive structures \u2014 gonads \u2014 remain. The female uses them to fertilize her eggs. The female anglerfish\u2019s body now contains both her cells and the male\u2019s. Thus, she is a natural chimera.",
            "Humans can create chimeras artificially, too. For example, grafting is a technique that involves sealing the cut ends of two separate plants together. Once healed, a successfully grafted plant will grow as one plant. That one plant, however, consists of parts from multiple plants. This allows people to grow one plant with characteristics of two. For example, a botanist may graft a tree known for producing delicious fruit to a root known for resisting disease. The result is a tree with both hardy roots and yummy fruit.",

            "Chonkus\u2019 traits could make it very useful for pulling climate-warming carbon out of the air and storing it in or near the ocean floor. In fact, its cells might be able to absorb a lot more carbon than the ocean\u2019s average cyanobacteria. And since they sink so fast, they could quickly remove carbon from air above the water.",
            "The discovery of Chonkus suggests that ocean-floor seeps that emit lots of carbon dioxide may hold other rare and useful organisms. Maybe even other life forms that could help store carbon in the ocean. When it comes to curbing the worst effects of climate change, such organisms may be tiny but mighty superheroes."

Volcanoes \u2014 on Earth and other planets \u2014 also create ash and lava fragments. These too become regolith. Meteorites crashing into moons, asteroids and planets can blast bedrock into tiny particles as well.",

This is what gives the \u201cRed Planet\u201d its distinctive hue. But the moon\u2019s regolith is made of lots of silicates. These compounds include the element silicon. Heat from meteorite collisions has melted some of these silicates. This has resulted in lunar regolith that consists of tiny pieces of glass.",

He was part of a team that shared its new findings November 1 in\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
            "Astronomers in China and Japan first noted this supernova in 1181 as a \u201cguest star\u201d in the sky. But modern astronomers didn\u2019t find the remains of that explosion, now called the Pa 30 nebula, until 2013.",
            "When they did find the remnant, it looked weird. The supernova appeared to be a kind called type 1a. This type of stellar explosion involves a white dwarf star\u00a0blowing up and destroying itself in the process. But in the case of Pa 30, part of the star survived.",
            "Stranger still, the star was surrounded by spiky filaments. Those tendrils stretch about three light-years in all directions. \u201cThis is really unique,\u201d Cunningham says. \u201cThere\u2019s no other supernova nebula that shows filaments like this.\u201d",
            "He and his colleagues used a telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to look at the nebula. They recorded how fast the filaments are moving relative to Earth. Then they built a 3-D model of those filaments and their motions through space.",
            "The system is structured \u201ckind of like a three-layered onion,\u201d Cunningham says. The inner layer is the star. Then there\u2019s a gap of one or two light-years, which ends in a spherical shell of dust. The final layer is the filaments, which emerge from the dust shell.",
            "How the filaments formed remains a mystery. Also unclear is how those spikes have managed to stay in such straight lines for centuries.",
            "Maybe a shock wave from the explosion ricocheted off the wispy material between this star and its neighbors. As the shock wave bounced back toward the white dwarf, it could have sculpted the material into the spikes astronomers see. But future studies will have to confirm or rule out that scenario."

Mass and weight are both measurements that describe heaviness, but they actually mean very different things. Let\u2019s be specific!",

Your body\u2019s mass is the same when you\u2019re curled up on the sofa or when you stretch as high as you can. And it\u2019s the same when you\u2019re at home or at the beach or at school! But your mass is a little bit more after you\u2019ve eaten breakfast, compared with when you first wake up in the morning. Mass is a fundamental measurement of how much matter an object contains.",

            "Weight is a measurement of the gravitational force on an object. It not only depends on the object\u2019s mass, but also on its location. Therefore, weight is actually a measure of force. In the United States, most people measure weight in pounds.",
            "Let\u2019s say that your body has a mass of 40 kilograms. Your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, on the moon, on Jupiter \u2014 and even floating inside the International Space Station. Your mass is 40 kilograms no matter where you are. But your weight differs from place to place because of differences in how hard gravity at each site pulls on you. On Earth\u2019s surface, 1 kilogram of mass is equivalent to 2.2 pounds of weight. So your 40-kilogram mass on Earth would weigh 40 x 2.2 \u2014 or 88 pounds.",
            "Language can get tricky here. Scientifically, you shouldn\u2019t say, \u201cMy doctor measured my weight as 40 kilograms,\u201d because weight isn\u2019t the same as mass. It would be similarly incorrect to say, \u201cMy doctor measured my mass as 88 pounds.\u201d However, since we all experience the same strength of Earth\u2019s gravity on our mass, in casual language we often use mass and weight interchangeably. In much the same way, most people feel comfortable describing mass in pounds and weight in kilograms.",
            "To avoid this confusion, scientists use a standard unit for force. It\u2019s called the newton (in honor of Isaac Newton). On Earth, 100 newtons of weight (a force) is equal to about 22 pounds. This is a measure of how hard Earth\u2019s gravity pulls on a mass of about 10 kilograms.",

            "The gravity you\u2019d feel on the surface of a planet depends on its density. We say that Earth has the gravitational force of one \u201cG.\u201d The moon is much smaller and less dense than Earth. Its gravity is one-sixth G. Although Jupiter is much, much bigger than Earth, it\u2019s not very dense. So Jupiter\u2019s gravity is 2.5 G.",
            "If your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, your 88-pound weight would drop to 15 pounds on the moon. On Jupiter, you\u2019d weigh 220 pounds. On the International Space Station, floating in orbit, your weight would be zero. But your mass would stay the same \u2014 40 kg \u2014 in all of these places. For that reason, mass is a fundamental property of matter and weight is not.",
            "Rocket launches offer an interesting example of how mass and weight relate. At launch, the rocket is full of fuel, so its mass is greatest. At Earth\u2019s surface, it also feels the maximum pull of gravity. So its weight is heaviest. A few minutes after launch, the rocket has burned through a huge portion of its fuel. This means it has lost mass as that fuel has been transformed into energy. In addition, the rocket is farther from Earth\u2019s surface. Gravity therefore pulls on it with even less force. Both the rocket\u2019s mass and its weight have dropped. The rocket\u2019s engines can now push the rocket even faster than they could at launch. (Next time you watch a rocket launch, notice how huge those launch engines are!)"

            "Kaufman now studies what he calls \u201cpersonal intelligence.\u201d It\u2019s how people\u2019s interests and natural abilities combine to help them work toward their goals. IQ is one such ability. Self-control is another. Both help people focus their attention when they need to, such as at school.",
            "Psychologists lump together a person\u2019s focused attention, self-control and problem-solving into a skill they call executive function. The brain cells behind executive function are known as the executive control network. This network turns on\u00a0when someone is taking an IQ test. Many of the same brain areas are involved in fluid intelligence.",
            "But personal intelligence is more than just executive function. It\u2019s tied to personal goals. If people are working toward some goal, they\u2019ll be interested and focused on what they are doing. They might daydream about a project even while not actively working on it. Although daydreaming may seem like a waste of time to outsiders, it can have major benefits for the person doing it.",
            "When engaged in some task, such as learning, people want to keep at it, Kaufman explains. That means they will push forward, long after they might otherwise have been expected to give up. Engagement also lets a person switch between focused attention and mind wandering.",
            "That daydreaming state can be an important part of intelligence. It is often while the mind is \u201cwandering\u201d that sudden insights or hunches emerge about how something works.",

For a long time, psychologists thought the default mode network was active only when the executive control network rested. In other words, you could not focus on an activity and daydream at the same time.",
            "To see if that was really true, last year Kaufman teamed up with researchers at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro and at the University of Graz in Austria. They scanned the brains of volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. This tool uses a strong magnetic field to record brain activity.",
            "As they scanned the brains of 25 college students, the researchers asked the students to think of as many creative uses as they could for everyday objects. And as students were being as creative as possible, parts of both the default mode network and the executive control network lit up. The two systems weren\u2019t at odds with each other. Rather, Kaufman suspects, the two networks work together to make creativity possible.",
            "\u201cCreativity seems to be a unique state of consciousness,\u201d Kaufman now says. And he thinks it is essential for problem-solving.",
            "Just being intelligent doesn\u2019t mean someone will be successful. And just because someone is less intelligent doesn\u2019t mean that person will fail. That\u2019s one take-home message from the work of people like Angela Duckworth.",

In 2007, she interviewed people from all walks of life. She asked each what they thought made someone successful. Most people believed intelligence and talent were important. But smart people don\u2019t always live up to their potential.",
            "When Duckworth dug deeper, she found that the people who performed best \u2014 those who were promoted over and over, or made a lot of money \u2014 shared a trait independent of intelligence. They had what she now calls grit. Grit has two parts: passion and perseverance. Passion points to a lasting interest in something. People who persevere work through\u00a0challenges to finish a project.",
            "Duckworth developed a set of questions to assess passion and perseverance. She calls it her \u201cgrit scale.\u201d",
            "In one study of people 25 and older, she found that as people age, they become more likely to stick with a project. She also found that grit increases with education. People who had finished college scored higher on the grit scale than did people who quit before graduation. People who went to graduate school after college scored even higher.",
            "She then did another study with college students. Duckworth wanted to see how intelligence and grit affected performance in school. So she compared scores on college-entrance exams (like the SAT), which estimate IQ, to school grades and someone\u2019s score on the grit scale. Students with higher grades tended to have more grit. That\u2019s not surprising. Getting good grades takes both smarts and hard work. But Duckworth also found that intelligence and grit don\u2019t always go hand in hand. On average, students with higher exam scores tended to be less gritty than those who scored lower.",
            "*a_girl_competing_in_a_spelling_bee_standing_on_stage",
            "fCStudents who perform best in the National Spelling Bee are those with grit. Their passion, drive, and persistance pay off and help them succeed against less \u201cgritty\u201d competitors.",
            "But some people counter that this grit may not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Among those people is Marcus Cred\u00e9. He\u2019s a psychologist at Iowa State University in Ames. He recently pooled the results of 88 studies on grit. Together, those studies involved nearly 67,000 people. And grit did not predict success, Cred\u00e9 found.",
            "However, he thinks grit is very similar to conscientiousness. That someone\u2019s ability to set goals, work toward them and think things through before acting. It\u2019s a basic personality trait, Cred\u00e9 notes \u2014 not something that can be changed.",
            "\u201cStudy habits and skills, test anxiety and class attendance are far more strongly related to performance than grit,\u201d Cred\u00e9 concludes. \u201cWe can teach [students] how to study effectively. We can help them with their test anxiety,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can do that with grit.\u201d",
            "In the end, hard work can be just as important to success as IQ. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to struggle and go through setbacks,\u201d Kaufman says. It might not be easy. But over the long haul, toughing it out can lead to great accomplishments."

This alkalization makes chocolate less bitter, she says. But all of that processing means the final piece of chocolate has likely lost many of its initial health-boosting flavanols.",

            "Growing cacao is a good way for farmers to earn money and support their families. But the demand for cacao keeps increasing. That makes it difficult for farmers to grow enough. Diseases also threaten their trees. Cacao-killing diseases would do more than take away a tasty treat \u2014 they also could plunge millions of people into poverty. Scientists are using the Cacao Genome Database in hopes of heading off both of these problems.",

They may even search for genes that allow the trees to grow more quickly.Such genes may already be known to exist in other, better-studied plants. Examples might include soybeans or corn. \u201cWe can find genes in cacao that are similar . . . to some of these,\u201d Guiltinan says. And, he points out, \u201cOften they share a similar function.\u201d",

            "Then they check to see if the new trees make more pods, for example, or resist\u00a0certain diseases. One such disease is called frosty pod. It makes cacao pods turn white and rot on the tree. Another is called witches\u2019 broom. This infection spreads throughout the tree and can eventually kill it. Fungi cause both diseases.",

            "It\u2019s a wonder chocolate exists. Talk about plants that resist help. Cacao trees provide the seeds from which chocolate is made. But those seeds develop only once the trees\u2019 blooms have been pollinated. The trees\u2019 fruit \u2014 known as pods \u2014 are created by dime-sized flowers. And those blooms are difficult. They make pollination barely possible.",
            "Growers of other commercial fruits expect 50 to 60 percent of the flowers on their crop plant to make seeds, notes Emily Kearney. And some cacao trees manage those rates. Kearney knows. She works at the University of California, Berkeley. A biologist there, she focuses on the pollination of cacao. The problem: Pollination rates in these plants tends to be much lower \u2014 as in closer to 15 to 30 percent. But in the South American country of Ecuador, traditional plantings may contain a mix of species. There,\u00a0 Kearney has seen cacao pollination rates of just 3 to 5 percent.",
            "The first sight of a blooming cacao tree (Theobroma cacao) can be \u201cdisconcerting,\u201d she says. That\u2019s because flowers don\u2019t sprout\u00a0from branches as in many other trees. Instead, they emerge directly from the trunk. They burst into little pink-and-white constellations of five-pointed starry blooms. Some trunks, Kearney says, \u201care completely covered with flowers.\u201d",
            "Pretty as they are, these flowers make nothing easy. Each petal curves into a tiny hood. This hood fits down around the plant\u2019s male, pollen-making structure. To reach that pollen, a honeybee would be a useless giant blimp. So tiny flies step up to the task. Each of them is little bigger than a poppy seed. Known as chocolate midges, they are\u00a0part of a\u00a0family called biting midges.",
            "After crawling up into the flowers\u2019 hoods, they do \u2014 something.",
            "But what? The flower offers those midges no nectar to drink. So far, researchers haven\u2019t even shown that some scent lures in the midges. Some biologists have mused that reddish parts of the flower offer nutritious nibbling for the bugs. But Kearney knows of no tests that have confirmed this.",
            "Another hitch to pollination: One cacao pod (resembling a wrinkled, swollen cucumber in shades of brown, purple or orange) requires from 100 to 250 grains of pollen to fertilize its 40 to 60 seeds. Yet midges typically emerge from a flower hood speckled with just a few to maybe 30 grains of the sticky white pollen. (Kearney says those pollen grains look\u00a0like \u201cclumpy sugar.\u201d)",

The female part sticks up in the very center of the flower, like some\u00a0white-bristled paintbrush. Yet pollen is useless for any blooms on\u00a0the tree it came from. That pollen won\u2019t even work for close relatives.",
            "To better understand cacao pollination, Kearney doesn\u2019t suggest looking for answers at cacao farms. She says, \u201cI think it\u2019s the wild individuals that are going to open up the field.\u201d",
            "These trees evolved mostly in the Amazon Basin. There, cacao trees often grow in clusters of siblings that a monkey might have accidentally planted (while sucking pulp from a pod, dropping seeds as it fed).",
            "To Kearney, dot-sized midges seem unlikely to fly the distance from clusters of cacao siblings to unrelated trees where cross-pollination chances would be better. So she wonders: Could the cacao with its elaborate reproductive system have a stealth, strong-flying native pollinator species that has to date escaped scientists\u2019 notice?"

Others come from the tree that provided the pollen. That\u2019s a challenge for researchers who study the genetics of cacao plants. As they try to improve features of these trees from one generation to the next, they don\u2019t want to wait years to learn whether a tree contains good genes for specific traits.",
            "And now they don\u2019t have to. Mark Guiltinan and Siela Maximova are plant biologists at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. Their secret: cloning.",
            "They start with a tree that has the genes they\u2019re interested in. These genes might help the tree resist diseases, for example. Or the genes might help the tree grow faster, or make better-tasting chocolate. (The researchers do not insert genes into the tree \u2014 it is not genetically modified. Rather, they look for genes that developed in them naturally.)",
            "The scientists snip off tiny pieces of a tree\u2019s flowers. They put the pieces in a germ-free solution. Then they add hormones that make each flower piece start growing into a young plant, as if it were a seed.",
            "In this way, the researchers can create thousands of plants from the pieces of a single flower. These new plants are clones. That means they have the exact same genes as their parent tree \u2014 and each other.\u00a0",
            "Identical genes are a blessing and a curse. Those genes may make a cacao tree grow lots of pods or keep it from getting a certain disease. But there are many different cacao diseases. Resistance to one disease may not protect the plant against another of them. Because all of these young plants share the same genes, they are all vulnerable to the same pests and diseases. If someone planted an entire farm or plantation with identical cacao trees, a single infection might later on wipe them all out.",
            "Guiltinan and Maximova are very much aware of the problem. \u201cWe would never recommend a single variety,\u201d Guiltinan says. Instead, he suggests that cacao farmers plant many genetically different types of trees. Each variety would produce many pods and be resistant to at least one disease. This should help ensure a healthy field \u2014 and a crop of delicious cacao."

When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",

            "The good news: No one was hurt. Large tourist ships ventured into that same fjord on the days before and after the tsunami. They were ferrying people on and off a beach with small boats, according to Kristian Svennevig.",
            "\u201cIt was pure luck that no one was there when it happened,\u201d he says. The powerful wave would have easily capsized the small boats and swept the people away.",
            "Svennevig is a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). He\u2019s based in Copenhagen, Denmark. He led a team that investigated the event. They now believe that Earth\u2019s warming climate set off the massive landslide that started it all. They described their findings September 13 in Science.",
            "Aside from those caused by earthquakes and volcanoes, \u201cmost landslides around the world you can tie to climatic factors,\u201d says Svennevig. And as Earth keeps warming, he worries, this dangerous event could be a warning of worse things to come.",
            "Saturday, September 16, 2023, started normally enough. But then at 11:35 a.m., sensors in Asia and North America picked up a sharp seismic signal. They detected waves rippling from a remote part of Greenland\u2019s east coast.",
            "Earthquakes typically cause such vibrations. But explosions, tsunamis and volcanoes can, too. Initially, the source here was unknown.",
            "The next day, tourists on a cruise ship noticed damage to an abandoned research station on east Greenland\u2019s Ella Island. Equipment that was stored on land, including a boat and a truck-size shipping container, had been washed into the sea.",
            "Svennevig heard these reports when he arrived at work Monday morning. Suspecting a tsunami, he looked through recent satellite images of the area. He hoped they would offer clues.",
            "And they did.",
            "For many kilometers along Dickson Fjord, vegetation had been erased from the shorelines. At Ella Island, the plants had vanished to heights as much as four meters (13 feet) above the water. Further west and inland, plants were missing to higher and higher coastal elevations.",
            "A huge wave must have come from the west, Svennevig realized. It would have started out tall and gradually shrunk as it rolled east.",
            "That afternoon, he and several colleagues homed in on its source.",

            "Two satellite photos taken September 15 and 17 showed that a small mountain ridge near the west end of the fjord had vanished.",
            "A frozen glacier had long sat at the foot of this ridge, some 72 kilometers (45 miles) from Ella Island. Somehow, the lower reaches of that glacier had been pulverized.",
            "The collapsed ridge had smashed down onto the glacier below. It released some 25 million cubic meters (880 million cubic feet) of rock and shattered ice. The volume of this debris was equal to 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This rock and ice tumbled off the end of the glacier and into the fjord\u2019s water.",

            "fCA mountain ridge overlooking this glacier in Greenland collapsed into a massive landslide. The tsunami it triggered swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down the fjord. Climate warming set off the disaster by causing the glacier to thin, which destabilized the mountain ridge that it had supported.",
            "The resulting splash threw water 200 meters (650 feet) up the nearby mountain slopes. The wave it triggered was 110 meters (360 feet) tall. It may have sped along the fjord at 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour or more!",
            "But there wasn\u2019t just a single wave.",
            "This explosive event provoked a repeating wave called a seiche (SAYSH). It resembled the back-and-forth sloshing of water in a bathtub. Except here it was way bigger \u2014 echoing through the fjord every 90 seconds for nine straight days.",
            "Though sudden, this catastrophe was caused by changes that have been slowly happening for decades. Earth\u2019s warming climate has shrunk the glacier by Dickson Fjord over time. No one knows how quickly it was losing ice. But other glaciers in this part of Greenland have thinned by as much as 150 meters (490 feet) since 1900. As the glaciers thinned, they laid bare the fragile mountain slopes that their ice had previously supported.",
            "And this appears to be why the ridge at Dickson Fjord collapsed, Svennevig says. It lost that icy support.",
            "He fears such disasters could become more common as Greenland and other Arctic sites warm.",
            "Since 2017, Svennevig has used satellite images to map more than 500 landslides along Greenland\u2019s coasts. Some happened thousands of years ago. Others crumbled as recently as 2021.",
            "In warmer parts of the world, heavy rains often trigger landslides. But a warming of permafrost caused many of the recent ones in Greenland. And here\u2019s how.",
            "As long as the temperature inside a mountain is no warmer than -10\u00b0 Celsius (14\u00b0 Fahrenheit), the ice within it acts as cement. It glues bits of rock together. But if the permafrost warms to around -1 \u00b0C (30 \u00b0F), that ice will change. \u201cIt actually starts to deform, like plastic or Play-Doh,\u201d Svennevig explains. Now individual rock bits no longer stick together. This can allow part of the mountainside to collapse.",
            "Indeed, at the sites of new landslides, he often sees rectangular blocks of frozen rock and gravel within the wreckage. Those house-sized icy blocks slowly thaw and crumble.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Elsewhere, melting ice has caused similar disasters.",
            "In 2016, two mountain glaciers in Tibet suddenly collapsed. Gradual warming weakened the Aru-1 and Aru-2 glaciers until their ice could no longer hold onto the mountain. The debris from this disintegration sent enough snow and ice cascading into a valley to fill 60,000 Olympic swimming pools.",
            "The ice and snow traveled up to eight kilometers (five miles) from its source. Along the way, it killed nine herders and hundreds of livestock.",
            "Melting Himalayan glaciers create a different hazard, too. Vast lakes of meltwater have formed behind huge rock piles at the ends of the glaciers. These lakes can suddenly burst out of their fragile natural dams. The resulting \u201coutburst floods\u201d can gush tens of kilometers down through any valley below, sweeping away people, homes, bridges and animals.\u00a0",
            "But landslide-tsunamis are especially worrisome because they often happen at sites with more people.",
            "In 1936, one roared through Lake Lovatnet in Norway. It swept away two villages, killing 74 people. And in 1958, a wave in Lituya Bay, Alaska, struck three large fishing vessels. One capsized and sank. One was tossed onto a hillside and destroyed. The third was tossed over a narrow strip of land and into deeper water; that boat, its captain and his 10-year-old son somehow survived.",
            "More recently, a 2017 landslide-tsunami flooded a village in western Greenland, killing four.",
            "But the risk of such an event around cruise ships that venture into fjords could prove especially catastrophic.",
            "\u201cThat is something that we definitely think a lot about,\u201d says Katherine Barnhart. She\u2019s a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. She studies landslide and tsunami risks in Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound. Much like Dickson Fjord in Greenland, steep mountains line its narrow, branching bay. And here, too, glaciers are shrinking.",
            "Detailed studies like the one Svennevig just published will help Barnhart accomplish a difficult task: building a computer program that can predict the size of a tsunami that a potential landslide might cause. \u201cBuilding up an inventory of events that have happened is really valuable,\u201d she explains.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/60T9TKuuujs?feature=oembed",
            "Authors of the new study explain how it took dozens of scientists to diagnose the source of an \u201cunusual seismic object, or USO\u201d that traveled around the globe for more than a week. Such events, they explain, can have deadly outcomes.",
            "The latest discovery leads Svennevig to worry that things could become worse. Far worse.",
            "Two years ago, one of his collaborators noticed something strange. At the time, Matthew Owen was a marine geologist at Aarhus University in Denmark. He was building sonar maps of the seafloor in Vaigat strait. It\u2019s a narrow ocean channel off western Greenland. These 3-D seafloor maps were being made to help scientists predict how future tsunamis would move through the water.",
            "As Owen assembled the maps, he noticed several large mounds on the bottom of the channel. Each covered many square kilometers. They looked like the mounds that a landslide would drop \u2014 except much bigger. Strewn along the seafloor were rectangular rocks the size of skyscrapers.",
            "\u201cSome of these individual blocks were bigger than the recent landslides\u201d that killed people, recalls Owen. (He now works at Global Maritime, a company in England that builds off-shore wind-energy farms.)",
            "When Owen showed these maps to Svennevig, they noticed something important. Each mound sat in front of a massive valley carved into the mountains above. Until then, no one had dared to think that those gouged valleys might be due to landslides. \u201cThey were just too big to comprehend,\u201d says Svennevig.",
            "Some were up to 100 times larger than the recent landslides. One had dumped up to 8.4 cubic kilometers (2 cubic miles) of rock onto the seafloor. That\u2019s enough to build 2,800 stacks of rock the size of the Empire State Building.",
            "Those landslides would have triggered enormous waves \u2014 many hundreds of meters high. Even 30 to 100 kilometers (18 to 60 miles) from where they formed, he found, waves had tossed rock and gravel as high as 70 meters (230 feet) up onto the land. At a similar distance, recent tsunamis like the one at Dickson Fjord had risen only about one-twentieth that high.",
            "These gigantic landslides likely happened at the end of the last Ice Age, some 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. That\u2019s when glaciers were retreating. And this rapid change destabilized the mountains.",
            "The Arctic\u2019s present-day warming could set the stage for a repeat of this, says Svennevig. \u201cWe should prepare for a future where these giant landslides can become a reality again.\u201d"

            "Installing a single row of flaps near the rear of an airfoil brought a different benefit. It blocked high-pressure air near the trailing edge of the wing from creeping toward the wing front. That\u2019s key, because low pressure is needed in the front to produce lift, Wissa explains.

They\u2019re combining some classic cooling concepts with new ideas. Their designs suggest how coming generations might build homes that deal with heat without being too costly.",

            "To test how well this design might keep interior spaces cool, Craig\u2019s team built a pair of small model \u201chomes.\u201d One included all the new features. The other modeled features and materials found in most of today\u2019s homes (although with no A/C).",
            "Then they placed four water bottles inside each model. Water absorbs and releases heat well. So these bottles acted as the thermal mass for the structures. Like the thick walls of ancient buildings, this mass absorbs indoor heat. Each model was then left for two days at a sunny desert site in Topanga, Calif. Sensors measured indoor heat and air flow in and out of each \u201chome.\u201d",
            "The new design stayed, on average, 1.6 \u00baC (2.9 \u00baF) cooler inside than the outside air. In contrast, the standard design was 4.3 \u00baC (7.7 \u00baF) warmer, on average, than the air outside.",
            "These results were good, but indoor temperatures kept going up and down, like a roller coaster. They varied by up to 6.8 \u00baC (12 \u00baF) over the day.",
            "To fix that, the team added two more water bottles to each home. This greater thermal mass helped indoor temps remain more stable. And the test home now drew in twice as much fresh air and expelled twice as much stale air as before.",
            "The average indoor temp was now 3.9 \u00baC (7.0 \u00baF) cooler than outside. It was 8.9 \u00baC (16 \u00baF) cooler than air in the standard-home model!",

            "The Columbia team developed a new \u201call-season\u201d design to make its house more effective and comfortable year-round. The angles of pleats on its zigzag siding can be varied, depending on the season. They could be adjusted to maximize cooling in summer and warming in winter.",

They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",

            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",

The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",

It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes.

            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, CO2 works like a blanket. It traps heat, warming our climate. Humans add a lot of CO2 to the air when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, for energy. Carbon capture can reduce this climate-warming CO2 pollution.",
            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"

            "Dandruff makes the scalp itch, but it\u2019s not a dry skin problem. Treating it may call for a change in how often you wash your hair, use of an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo, or even turning to a prescription shampoo. ",
            "Dandruff flakes on your hair or shoulders don\u2019t look good. The itchy scalp that comes with it is no fun, either. In fact, although dandruff shows up on your hair, the condition actually starts with your scalp.",
            "Dandruff is a type of dermatitis (Der-muh-TY-tis), or skin inflammation. One study estimated that half of us will at some point develop this condition. And one key time it may emerge is puberty.",
            "Everyone\u2019s scalp hosts a mix of microbes. This is known as its microbiome (MY-kroh-BY-ohm). Sometimes the normal proportion of some types to others gets messed up. This is known as a dysbiosis (Dis-by-OH-sis). In people with dandruff, certain types of yeast and bacteria are far more common, compared to people with healthy scalps.",
            "Amy McMichael\u00a0and others discussed some of the culprits in a July 2024 report in the Archives of Dermatological Research. She\u2019s a dermatologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Both are in Winston-Salem, N.C.",
            "People often make the mistake of thinking an itchy, scaly scalp is dry, McMichael says. If they add oil, though, they risk making matters worse. Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",
            "Hair-care practices might explain some of the difference, McMichael says. She and others have found differences in how often women of African and European ancestry shampoo their hair. Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",
            "And also use hair conditioners, McMichael advises. \u201cIt actually smooths the outer layer \u2014 the cuticle \u2014 much better than you can get with oil.\u201d Be careful about using hair sprays and gels, she adds. These can dry hair, increasing the risk that strands will break.",
            "In any case, if you notice a hair or scalp problem, talk to your doctor or another health-care expert right away. You might need help for dandruff. Or you might have a more serious skin or hair condition.",
            "\u201cThe earlier that you come in, the better off you are,\u201d McMichael says."
