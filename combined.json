            "Yogurt-making dates to around 7,000 years ago. The process starts with warm milk. Then people add safe, healthy bacteria to acidify and thicken the liquid. They keep the mixture warm for several hours, giving it time to ferment.",

His team started by injecting cells with a special goo called a photoresist. When hit with light from a laser, the photoresist hardens. Human\u2019s team focused the laser to a tiny area. By moving the where it was focused, they created small but incredibly detailed structures. Afterward, they let the leftover photoresist dissolve.",

            "To boost the cells\u2019 odds of survival, Humar\u2019s team combed through existing photoresists. They chose one that seemed fairly cell-friendly. And upon 3-D printing, some cells not only survived but went about their business as if nothing had happened. Some cells even divided. These cells split in two, passing on a 3-D-printed inheritance to one of the daughter cells.",
            "Humar\u2019s team shared its results in a study posted June 16 at arXiv.org. It has not yet been peer-reviewed by other scientists. Humar has declined to comment on the new work while his team\u2019s paper is waiting formal publication in a peer-reviewed journal.",

            "In addition to the elephant and barcodes, the researchers 3-D printed a micro-laser. It consists of a tiny sphere. When illuminated, it traps and amplifies light inside it. Micro-lasers could also be used to track cells. Subtle variations in the sphere size change the light the laser emits. So each cell could have a distinct light signature.",

So the large trees and darting squirrels he saw while hiking in New Hampshire, last year, awed him. \u201cThat was very new to me.\u201d That hike is now crystallized in Lin\u2019s memory. So, oddly, are the more familiar chickens he saw on his way to that hike.",
            "Lin is a brain and behavior expert at Boston University in Massachusetts. His latest research helps explain why both those chickens and squirrels have lodged in his memory.",
            "Events that pack an emotional punch help people remember moments they would otherwise forget, that research shows. Lin is part of a team that shared these findings September 24 in Science Advances.",
            "The brain seems to tie together related objects and events. That\u2019s probably why Lin remembers ordinary farm animals along with what he saw as super cool squirrels.",
            "Understanding what people remember \u2014 and forget \u2014 could help students retain information. And, Lin adds, it might also help therapists better treat trauma patients.",

            "Pairing a weak memory with a strong one can make the weaker one stick, too. Known as tag and capture, this theory has been around since the 1990s. Researchers suspected everyday memories could create temporary marks \u2014 or tags \u2014 on neurons. These tags would disappear, however, within a few hours. Think of them like Post-it notes that can easily fall off.",
            "If, however, a more powerful memory comes along shortly afterward, the weaker memory might be saved.",
            "Here\u2019s how it was thought to work. The powerful memory triggers a rush of proteins in the hippocampus and linked areas of the brain. These are areas where memories form. Tagged neurons would capture those proteins. And just like adding a strong glue to the Post-it note, they\u2019d make the weak memories stick to the powerful ones.",
            "Lin and his team decided to test that idea.",
            "They asked more than 100 people to observe sequences of images on a computer. Sometimes people saw animals (such as aardvarks, hamsters or sea stars). Other times they saw everyday tools. Participants initially just viewed these images \u2014 dozens of them. Next, they viewed similar images. This time, they\u2019d be rewarded for labeling them as animals or tools.",
            "About half the participants, for instance, might receive 900 points for identifying a hamster as an animal and 1 point for identifying a hammer as a tool. The other half received the opposite rewards: maybe 900 points for the hammer and 1 point for the hamster.",
            "The next day, the team gave their participants a pop quiz on images they\u2019d seen the day before. And, it turns out, both reward size and type of image sometimes affected what these people remembered.",
            "Receiving a big reward for identifying animals enhanced someone\u2019s memories of animals. Those who received a small reward remembered about 45 percent of the animals they\u2019d seen in the first round. Participants remembered more \u2014 about 50 percent \u2014 if they\u2019d received a large reward for labeling the animals earlier.",
            "This memory boost didn\u2019t work for tools, though. Big rewards didn\u2019t help people remember the tools they\u2019d seen earlier. Lin suspects that\u2019s because people formed strong memories of the tools from the beginning, so adding a reward didn\u2019t provide much more of a benefit.",
            "Rewards for animals also didn\u2019t help people remember which tools they\u2019d seen. It seems the brain links memories within a category, not across different categories.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Everyday memories are known to be temporary, says Joseph Dunsmoor. This cognitive neuroscientist works at the University of Texas at Austin where he has done similar research. This new study, he notes, is one of the first to show the brain is more likely to recall weak memories when they relate to some other, strong memory. \u201cThe thing that occurred in the past suddenly takes on more meaning,\u201d he concludes.",
            "Lin\u2019s team also showed that people were better at forming new memories after receiving a big reward. After a big event, the brain is alert. It\u2019s open to new information. So now, Lin says, new memories are more likely to stick around.",
            "Sorting out what\u2019s going on in the brain while memories form will take more time.",
            "In the meantime, therapists could use these findings to help people enhance the everyday memories that occurred before a trauma. This might dull the pain of what came after, Lin says. Teachers might also use the findings to help students retain more of what they learn. For instance, Lin suggests, if Susie surprisingly jumps up and down in a math word problem, perhaps the class should jump up and down, too."

That\u2019s about one-one hundredth of an inch long. A bioengineer, Lahiji works at Cursus Bio. It\u2019s a drug company in Seoul, South Korea.

            "Hyaluronic (HY-uh-lu-RON-ik) acid \u2014 a chemical that plumps up our skin \u2014 gives structural support to the microneedles. Those tiny needles then deliver antibacterial compounds right where they\u2019re needed. Inflammation-fighting chemicals also cool redness and swelling.",

In contrast, \u00c7elik notes, patches would deliver a drug to a broader area \u2014 \u201cnot a single point.\u201d He believes that will lead to a better immune response than a typical shot.",

But his team is working on ways that microneedles could deliver such drugs. One type would deliver medicines targeted at diabetes and obesity. His group described it in 2024 in Advanced Materials.",
            "Governments regulate what new medical products can be used in their countries. These rules ensure those products are safe. In the United States, for instance, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, writes those rules. Right now, no such rules exist for microneedle patches, \u00c7elik notes. That makes them a headache for companies to develop and bring to pharmacies. \u201cEveryone is waiting for\u201d those guidelines, he says.",

            "Locking microneedles might help open the door for patch delivery of other medications. Why? When it comes to prescription drugs, how much a patch dispenses really matters, explains \u00c7elik. The FDA would require a patch to deliver a set dose \u2014 not more, not less. Patches typically lack such consistency.",
            "For example, a patch may deliver 40 percent of the drug one time. The next, it might deliver only 8 percent, notes \u00c7elik. A microneedle patch for prescription medicines, he says, must deliver the same amount of drug \u201ceach and every time.\u201d",
            "By anchoring the new patches in place, the new microneedles should mean that \u201cevery time, they will deliver approximately 80 percent of the drug,\u201d \u00c7elik says. At least, he adds, \u201cThat\u2019s what [its makers now] claim.\u201d",

            "Our moon doesn\u2019t remain at a constant distance from Earth. That\u2019s because it orbits Earth in the shape of an ellipse \u2014 like a squashed oval. Sometimes the moon\u2019s orbit takes it farther away. Sometimes it draws the moon closer. When the moon swings closer to Earth, it can appear larger than usual. Sometimes this event coincides with phases of the moon that amplify the effect.",

This point \u2014 when the moon\u2019s orbit is closest to Earth \u2014 is called perigee. When it\u2019s so close to Earth, the moon\u2019s disk is about 14 percent larger in the sky than normal.",
            "The moon makes no light of its own. What we call moonlight is actually sunlight reflecting off the moon\u2019s surface. A full moon is when the side of the moon facing Earth is completely lit up. It looks like a full circle, or disk. When a supermoon occurs during a full moon, astronomers call it a full supermoon. With the moon\u2019s fully illuminated disk looking supersized, it really stands out in the night sky.",

            "Scientists had predicted this, based on general relativity. That\u2019s a theory of gravity. It describes how mass bends spacetime (which then gives rise to gravity). Gravitational waves stretch and squeeze spacetime as they pass by. General relativity also predicts that extremely compact objects \u2014 black holes \u2014 can form. Around them, spacetime will bend so much that nothing can escape.",

A physicist at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., she worked on the new study. \u201cThe frequencies that an object makes when you strike it are unique to it,\u201d she says. For a bell, those frequencies correspond to different pitches, or sounds. The bell\u2019s size and shape determine what sounds it will make when struck.",

            "LIGO\u2019s measurements matched something called a Kerr black hole. That\u2019s the prediction for how a spinning black hole should behave.

It states that the surface area of a black hole can grow over time \u2014 but not shrink. The newly formed black hole had a surface area larger than the sum of the two original ones. That agrees with this rule.",

He didn\u2019t work on the new tech. But it could someday be used in environmental, industrial and security-monitoring applications, he says.",
            "This is hardly the first attempt to make a microphone that works with light. Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone, built one back in 1880. He called it a photophone. It carried sound on a beam of light.",
            "Sound travels as air transfers vibrations from one molecule to the next \u2014 until they reach our eardrums. When sound waves hit objects, such as a leaf or sheet of glass, they vibrate those surfaces, too. The movements are too tiny for us to see. Still, they can be measured.",
            "That\u2019s what the photophone did. It directed a speaker\u2019s voice onto the back of a flexible mirror. As someone spoke, the sounds disturbed the air. Those disturbances, in turn, made the mirror flex back and forth. This alternately transformed the mirror\u2019s surface into concave and convex shapes. And that flexing changed how light reflected off it.",

Such photoelectric sensors are called pixels.\u201d",
            "Cameras usually have a lot of these sensors arranged on a flat surface. The light intensity at those sensors gets combined and displayed as an image.",
            "Single-pixel imaging, in contrast, uses just one sensor. It collects data for an image by making measurements as it scans a scene. Then computers assemble all these data to reconstruct an image.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",

            "\u201cThis method enables sound detection using everyday items, like paper cards and leaves, under natural lighting,\u201d Yao says. What\u2019s more, it creates a relatively small amount of data. That makes it easy to download for storage or to upload to the internet.",
            "The device can pick up vibrations from faint audio. But right now this only works in a laboratory.",
            "Yao\u2019s group is also working to make its device more sensitive and accurate. So far, it can capture sound from about a half meter (1.6 feet) away. The scientists hope to increase that distance. They also aim to make the microphone smaller and more portable \u2014 \u201ca device that ordinary people can carry around conveniently.\u201d",
            "The researchers suspect one application could be listening for a human pulse and heart rate. The team is fine-tuning the microphone\u2019s ability to measure a pulse, Yao says.",
            "Detecting sound in environments that are noisy or have a lot of movement remains a key challenge, Yao says. That will take more advanced computer algorithms, along with improved hardware and extensive field testing. But if they succeed, he says, this tech could prove \u201cstable, practical and widely applicable in real-world scenarios.\u201d"

            "Light pollution makes birds work overtime.",
            "Streetlamps, buildings and other human-made sources pollute the night with artificial light. This extra brightness can lead to birds singing nearly an hour longer per day, researchers have found. That number comes from a new study of nearly 600 bird species around the world.",
            "How much the singing increased took the researchers by surprise. \u201cWe expected some behavioral adjustment to the lights at night,\u201d says Neil Gilbert. But \u201cwe didn\u2019t anticipate that it would be this impactful.\u201d Gilbert is an ecologist at the Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. He studies how human actions impact wildlife behavior.\u00a0",
            "Past research has shown that artificial light has a big impact on wildlife. Birds that migrate at night can become disoriented by the lights. This can cause them to crash into buildings, leading to injuries and even death.",
            "The cycle between day and night also plays a part in controlling behavior and hormones in some birds. Artificial lights can mess with these natural rhythms. That can change when birds sleep, breed and migrate. Some studies have shown that certain bird species become active earlier in the day in light-polluted areas.",
            "Gilbert and his colleague Brent Pease wanted to know how light affects birds on a much larger scale. Pease is a wildlife ecologist at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. The duo used data from BirdWeather. In this global citizen science project, volunteers record bird sounds. Machine learning analyzes each sound to identify the species.",
            "Gilbert and Pease filtered the dataset for 4.4 million bird calls. They then looked at the daily start and end times of 583 bird species\u2019 songs. And they compared those times to the local light-pollution levels.",

            "Light\u2019s effects were especially noticeable for species with larger eyes. This may be because such birds are more sensitive to light. One of these species is the killdeer (Charadrius vociferus). It\u2019s a shorebird found across much of North America.",
            "The effect of light pollution was also greater during the breeding season. This is when birds naturally start singing earlier, during darker morning hours. If they live in light-polluted areas, artificial lights might fool them into thinking it\u2019s later than it is. This can encourage them to sing even earlier.",
            "It\u2019s still unclear whether this extra singing is harmful to birds. It might disrupt their sleep, says Gilbert. But the birds might make up for that by sleeping during the day. Extra time awake may even be helpful. It could give birds more time to find food to feed their young.For Pease, the findings show just how much people can impact wildlife without meaning to. \u201cWe cast [lights] more or less mindlessly into the night,\u201d Pease says. Yet these lights \u201care having widespread and often subtle effects on the lives of animals all around us.\u201d"

A fresh campfire may blaze yellow, giving off lots of smoke and soot. A gas stove might burn blue, smokeless and super-duper hot. And floating fuel can ignite calmly spinning blue whirls.",
            "Scientists discovered blue whirls by accident in 2016. They had been studying another kind of flame called a fire whirl. These flames look like swirling yellow tornadoes.",
            "The team set up conditions to make fire whirls in the lab by burning fuel floating on water. This first creates what is called a pool fire. That\u2019s when the floating fuel vaporizes first, and then that vapor burns. A pool fire often changes into a yellow fire column called a fire whirl.",
            "But to the researchers\u2019 surprise, some fire whirls suddenly changed. Chaotic, yellow fire tornadoes swirled into calm blue flames. In 2020, scientists mapped the structure of blue whirls. Four smaller flames come together to create this storm of fire perfection.",

            "If you were asked to choose a healthy snack, what would it be? Perhaps you\u2019d opt for a tangy mango or cup of tart Greek yogurt topped with berries. Maybe crunchy broccoli florets with hummus comes to mind. These are all packed with nutrients \u2014 chemical substances that help our bodies function. Among those nutrients are traces of vitamins.",
            "Food scientists group vitamins and minerals together as micronutrients. That\u2019s because living things need these to survive \u2014 but only in tiny amounts. While both vitamins and minerals are essential, chemically they\u2019re quite different.",
            "Dietary minerals are elements that appear in soil and water. Calcium and iron are examples. Vitamins, in contrast, are molecules \u2014 made of several elements. Vitamins are also organic, meaning they contain the element carbon. ",
            "Our bodies can\u2019t make minerals or most vitamins. That\u2019s why we must get them from what we eat.Altogether, we need 13 vitamins to stay healthy. Eight are known as B vitamins. Rounding out the list are vitamins A, C, D, E and K. These all play essential roles in keeping our organs, tissues and cells working.",
            "Some, such as the B vitamins, help the body break down and release energy from food. Vitamin K allows our blood to clot. Vitamin A is important for our lungs, skin and eyes.Vitamin D is a pro-hormone. The kidneys turn it into a fully active hormone. And it\u2019s quite versatile. This hormone plays a pivotal role in building strong bones and muscles and protecting the body from diseases, including some cancers. This vitamin also helps fight infections.",
            "Other vitamins \u2014 such as C and E \u2014 are antioxidants. They help protect against unstable molecules. At high levels, such molecules, called radicals, can damage cells and DNA.",
            "Vitamin C also supports your immune system in various ways. For instance, it helps keep immune cells healthy. But vitamin C also helps create collagen. A protein, collagen serves as a building block for many tissues, including our skin and the lining of our respiratory system. Those organs act as early lines of defense against incoming germs, explains Evangeline Mantzioris. She directs nutrition and food science at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.By keeping these systems healthy, vitamins help our bodies fight germs, limiting their chance of causing serious disease.",
            "Clearly, Mantzioris says, vitamins don\u2019t just target one specific body function or organ. They make sure our bodies as a whole work as they should.",

            "Fat-soluble vitamins \u2014 A, D, E and K \u2014 tend to show up in fatty foods. In fact, that fat helps our bodies better absorb these nutrients. Our liver and body will store any extra of these vitamins that we might consume until they\u2019re needed later. \u201cEven if we\u2019re really lean, we still have a little bit of a fat stored in our body,\u201d says Mantzioris. ",

            "Vitamin D is special. Known as the sunshine vitamin, our skin starts a process of making it by using the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light. Today, most people lack ideal amounts. One reason: Covering up the body too much when in the sun. Sunscreen helps protect against skin cancers but limits vitamin D production. So does spending most of the daylight hours indoors. Darkly pigmented skin and very heavy cloud cover can limit exposure to the UV light that kick-starts vitamin D production. So can living at high latitudes, where a steep path through the atmosphere can filter out much of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light.\u00a0",

            "But for most of us who eat a balanced diet and get enough sunlight, these products are unnecessary. Instead, focus on eating a healthy diet that includes plenty of produce. Notes Mantzioris, \u201cWe didn\u2019t evolve on supplements. We evolved on whole food.\u201d ",

            "Whole foods contain more than just vitamins. For instance, oranges are an excellent source of vitamin C. But these and other types of fresh produce also contain hundreds of other nutrients that aren\u2019t found in artificial supplements, Mantzioris points out. These include plant compounds called phytonutrients. Such compounds give many fruits and veggies their vibrant colors. Scientists suspect they also boost health and fight disease. And new ones are still being discovered. ",
            "Supplements can be useful, though. People with certain medical conditions may need help getting enough of some vitamins. And it\u2019s hard to reach the recommended amount of vitamin D through food alone. Vitamin D supplements may help those with heavily pigmented skin or whose skin doesn\u2019t get access to enough of the sun\u2019s UV rays.But these supplements should only be taken after talking with your doctor, says Mantzioris. One reason: Mixing vitamin supplements with certain medications can be risky. ",
            "Some vitamins, such as A, can be toxic when taken in high amounts. But poisoning is highly unlikely to happen when they\u2019re consumed as part of a balanced diet. Most people who consume too many vitamins do so by taking supplements.Taking too many supplements also risks flooding the body with more nutrients than it can handle. Fat-soluble vitamins can build up in our fat stores over time, leading to dangerous side effects. Even overdosing on some water-soluble vitamins can pose problems.Cases of poisoning from water-soluble vitamin B6, for instance, are on the rise in Australia, notes Mantzioris. In addition to supplements, this nutrient is often added to energy drinks, weight-loss shakes and certain food products. One symptom of too much B6 is nerve damage. It often starts as a tingling in the fingers and toes. \u201cIf it\u2019s not caught in time, it can cause permanent damage,\u201d Mantzioris says.Instead of splurging on supplements, Mantzioris recommends that people looking to stay healthy should focus on a food-first approach. \u201cPeople spend a lot of money on these [vitamin supplements] \u2014 and mostly without a lot of gain,\u201d says Mantzioris. \u201cI would rather spend the money on having really yummy food.\u201d",

            "People have long known that some birds line their nests with fur. For many years, scientists thought birds used hair that mammals had shed into the environment. Mammals shed hair regularly, leaving individual hairs behind as they travel. During a seasonal molt, some mammals drop the hair they shed in clumps, making it easy for birds to collect. ",
            "But some birds don\u2019t wait around for their furry companions to molt. They don\u2019t search for a carcass to raid, either. Instead, they go straight to the source, plucking fur directly from the live mammal\u2019s body.",

            "Kleptotrichy is more common in temperate regions where nights can get cold. It happens less often in the tropics and subtropics. The regional difference suggests that the hair helps to keep eggs and nestlings warm at night. Or perhaps the mammal smell helps discourage predators from attacking the nest.",

            "Some breaks in bones need a little help to mend. So surgeons sometimes take a bit of bone from elsewhere in the body to make a patch called a graft. Or they can use a synthetic \u2014 human-made \u2014 material that mimics bone.",

            "The idea was to design a printing system that could be easily used in operating rooms, says Jung Seung Lee. He\u2019s a biomedical engineer at Sungkyunkwan University. That\u2019s in Seoul, South Korea. Compared with regular bone grafts, he says, this system can save time, cost and complex procedures.",
            "The printing device holds sticks of a specially made \u201cbioink.\u201d It\u2019s safe to use in the body. It consists of two compounds commonly used for 3-D printing implants. One, hydroxyapatite, is a mineral found in bones. The other is a body-safe plastic called polycaprolactone, or PCL. That\u2019s included to support new bone as it grows. In an implant, it \u201cgradually degrades in our body over months,\u201d Lee says. Over time, newly grown bone will fill in as the graft breaks down.",
            "The ratio of the two compounds in the bioink determines the material\u2019s strength and stiffness. So the researchers can tailor the mixture for each use. They also added antibiotics into the bioink to prevent infections.",

            "So the researchers modified their glue gun to work at lower temperatures. They also adjusted the tip for better control. Thanks to the low melting point of PCL, the bioink can be applied at about 60\u00b0 Celsius (140\u00b0 Fahrenheit). It cools to body temperature within 40 seconds. The whole process takes just a few minutes.",
            "Lee\u2019s team tested the printer and bioink on broken leg bones in rabbits. Another set of rabbits got a material called bone cement, which is used to attach implants to bones. The rabbits that got the bioink had better healing and regrowth of bone tissue. And the animals showed no signs of infection during the 12 weeks after surgery. The team shared its results September 5 in Device.",
            "For now, the printer is still a proof-of-concept for people. Lee aims to develop it into a multi-use printing system. For instance, it might apply chemicals that promote healing during surgeries. But first, researchers will have to do more studies to make sure the technology is safe. They\u2019ll also need to figure out how to disinfect the device between uses.",
            "There may be other limitations. \u201cThe high temperature of the extruded material is likely to stress or kill the cells,\u201d says Deborah Mason. She\u2019s a molecular and cell biologist at Cardiff University in Wales. She wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Lee\u2019s team is working to modify the tip of the device.

            "But there is a long way to go for that to happen, she says. The printer would need to work with other tools that surgeons use. Those include imaging technologies and robotic devices used during surgeries. That would take the new device beyond just a \u201cdefect-filler,\u201d she says. Someday, it could be a \u201cbone printer pen\u201d useful for many types of surgeries.",

            "But if the chill doesn\u2019t matter, why do people get sick more in winter?",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve spent the past 13 years looking into this question,\u201d says Linsey Marr. As a civil and environmental engineer, Marr studies viruses in the air. She works at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. \u201cThe deeper we go, the more I realize we don\u2019t know [and] the more there is to figure out.\u201d",

            "Winter\u2019s shorter days may make people more prone to infection, he says. Less sunlight means people\u2019s bodies make less vitamin D. That vitamin helps the immune system fight off disease. But that\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle.",
            "Scientists are also studying other things that make winter a sickening season.",
            "By making me come inside, grandma may have actually increased the risk that I\u2019d get sick.",
            "Some viruses spread more when people spend more time indoors. Examples include colds, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. In places that have four distinct seasons, these viruses cause more illness in winter. They also spread more during rainy seasons in tropical zones. COVID-19 spreads more easily indoors than outside, too.",
            "Here are four reasons why winter is cold and flu season. #winter #sick #virus #science #learnitontiktok",
            "Why? These infections are caused by viruses that travel in small droplets. Such droplets are a type of aerosol. They can be released into the air when sick people exhale.",
            "\u201cOutdoors, you\u2019re in the ultimate well-ventilated space,\u201d says David Fisman. He is an epidemiologist in Canada. He works at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Viruses exhaled outdoors quickly mix with clean air, he explains. This dilution makes it harder for the viruses to reach people.",
            "But inside, aerosols \u2014 including any viruses \u2014 can build up. \u201cThe air you breathe in is often air that other people have breathed out,\u201d Fisman says. Being close to contagious people could increase your chance of getting sick.\u00a0",
            "But being inside can\u2019t be the whole reason people tend to get sick in winter, says Benjamin Bleier. He is a doctor who specializes in sinus and nasal disorders. He works at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cIn modern society, we\u2019re indoors all year round,\u201d he says. So to drive the seasonal pattern, he says, something else must be going on. Bleier thinks people must become more prone to infection in winter. And the amount of virus circulating must go up, he says.",
            "Some viruses thrive in winter. The reason may not be cold temperatures but low humidity (low levels of moisture in air).",
            "Take flu viruses and SARS-CoV-2. That\u2019s the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Those viruses survive best when the relative humidity falls below about 40 percent. Marr and other researchers made that discovery.",
            "Viruses are sensitive to humidity because they aren\u2019t usually floating around naked, Marr explains. They are encased in droplets of fluid (think spit or snot) \u2014 which can dry up in low humidity. Those droplets also have bits of mucus, proteins, salt and other substances in them. Those other components may determine if the virus survives drying.",
            "When the humidity is higher, droplets dry slowly. Such slow drying concentrates salt and other things in the droplets that can harm a virus. That kills viruses such as influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. Marr and her colleagues reported that finding last July in a paper posted on bioRxiv.org. (Studies posted there have not yet been vetted by other scientists.)",
            "Meanwhile, in low humidity, droplets dry fast. That flash-drying in parched air preserves viruses. \u201cIf the air is very dry, the water quickly evaporates. Everything is dried down, and it\u2019s almost like things are frozen in place,\u201d Marr says.",
            "Viruses often travel through the air inside airborne droplets, or aerosols. When the air is dry, aerosols dry quickly (left). This drying encloses viruses in a layer of crystals that look like feathers (as this microscope image shows). That flash-drying protects viruses, although scientists don\u2019t know exactly how. At medium levels of humidity, crystals form inside liquid droplets (middle). Those crystals may inactivate viruses, not protect them. At high humidity levels (right), aerosols remain liquid. This also allows viruses to survive better than at mid-level humidity.",

            "Drier, smaller aerosols also are more buoyant than large droplets. So, those aerosols can hang in the air longer. That ups the chance someone will be able to breathe them in, Fisman says.",
            "What\u2019s more, dry air can tear down some of our defenses against viruses. Dry air can trigger the death of some cells lining the airways. That could leave cracks where viruses can invade. Scientists know this from studies in lab animals.",
            "Mucus in the airways can trap viruses and help protect against infection. That mucus carries germs out of the body through a runny nose or hacked-up phlegm. But breathing cold, dry air can slow the system that moves mucus out of the body. That slowdown may give viruses time to break out of the mucus trap and invade cells, Fisman says.",
            "Temperature changes can also impact the immune system \u2014 an important defense against disease.",
            "Normally, the immune system employs a trick to help ward off viruses. Bleier is part of a team that recently discovered this trick. Cells in the nose are studded with surface proteins that can detect viruses. Other cells in the body also have virus sensors. When one of these sensor proteins sees a virus coming, it signals the cell to release tiny bubbles. Those bubbles \u2014 called extracellular vesicles \u2014 work as decoys. Viruses may go after them instead of infecting real cells.",
            "The virus that docks with one of the bubbles is in for a surprise. Inside the vesicles are virus-killing bits of genetic material. They\u2019re called microRNAs. One type of microRNA in the bubbles is known as miR-17. It can kill multiple types of cold-causing viruses. Bleier\u2019s team shared those findings December 6, 2022, in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.",
            "Cold temps may impede the body\u2019s ability to make such virus-killing decoy bubbles. Bleier\u2019s team grew human nasal cells in lab dishes at 37\u00b0 Celsius (98.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That is our typical body temperature. The researchers measured how many bubbles the cells released. Then, the scientists lowered the thermostat to 32\u00b0 C (89.6\u00b0 F). Cells released about 42 percent fewer bubbles at the cooler temperature. What\u2019s more, those vesicles carried fewer virus-killing weapons. Vesicles can pack in about 24 percent more microRNA at body temperature than when it is cooler.",
            "The body\u2019s immune system uses a clever trick to keep viruses from infecting cells in the nose. When the body detects viruses (black and gray spheres), cells in the nose release bubbles (blue circles). These bubbles are called extracellular vesicles. The bubbles sport proteins (red, blue and black shapes on blue circles) like ones found on nasal cells. This makes them effective decoys: Viruses may go after the bubbles instead of infecting real cells. But when it gets cold (right), cells release fewer bubbles. This makes it easier for viruses to find and infect real nasal cells.",

Rather than dropping, the leaves of a marcescent tree hang on until wind or another force knocks them down.",

Their lime green leaves turn orangey-gold. Then they cling to their branch tip and rattle in the cold wind all winter long. Eventually, a strong force \u2014 such as wind \u2014 may break them off.

The unappetizing dead leaves of marcescent trees may deter deer from snacking. Another theory is that dead leaf clusters provide a physical barrier that the deer must chew through to reach the juicy new growth underneath.",

But many of the routines might be more harmful than helpful, a new study shows. The majority of the regimens shown are costly, have harmful ingredients and lack sunscreen. Most don\u2019t offer benefits for young skin. And they may lead to skin damage.",
            "This study suggests that young people are getting a lot of health information from TikTok instead of more reliable sources such as doctors, parents or skincare specialists, says Nusheen Ameenuddin. She\u2019s a pediatrician at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.",

            "To start, Hales and a colleague each made TikTok accounts. They reported that they were 13 years old. Then they scrolled through their \u201cFor You\u201d pages until they had seen 100 skincare routine videos. As they watched, the researchers noted information on the content creators, the products and the cost of each regimen.",

Because the creators\u2019 ages weren\u2019t specified, the team assigned age ranges based on appearance and context clues.

            "A post shared by Science News Explores (@sn.explores)",
            "More than half of the products had fragrance. Many scents are contact allergens. That means they can cause an allergic reaction when they come in contact with skin. They are one of the most common things people develop a skin allergy to, says Hales.",
            "Plus, the 25 most-viewed videos had an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients. These can cause an itching, burning, tingling or prickling sensation.",
            "The most common of these ingredients were alpha-hydroxy acids. These chemicals exfoliate skin, removing surface layers. They\u2019re common in anti-aging products because they can smooth fine lines and wrinkles and improve skin texture. They\u2019re also used in some products to prevent acne. But they can irritate and damage young skin.",
            "Creators used products with alpha-hydroxy acids an average of three times per video and as many as seven times in one regimen. This is harmful because the chemical becomes more irritating the more you layer it.",
            "Alpha-hydroxy acids also increase the skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends staying out of the sun and using sunscreen with these products. But on average, only 26 percent of the TikTok videos included any type of sun protection. So these regimens would boost the risk of sunburn and other sun damage.",
            "Though not part of the study, pediatrician Molly O\u2019Shea was distressed by the findings. \u201cThe majority of the products that were being shown and demonstrated weren\u2019t designed for young skin,\u201d says O\u2019Shea. She practices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.",
            "Many of the products had abrasive features, such as retinols, scrubs and beads, that can damage the skin. These types of products are usually meant for people whose skin has begun to show signs of aging, says O\u2019Shea. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, using products that are designed for older skin can actually damage your skin.\u201d",

            "The products seemed to be used as status symbols, says Hales. \u201cThat may make someone feel bad if they don\u2019t have the money or they\u2019re not in a position to be able to afford that kind of skincare routine.\u201d Studies have shown that comparing yourself to others who seem \u201cbetter\u201d can have big drawbacks, especially for teens. \u201cIt can have a harmful effect on your self-image,\u201d says Hales.",
            "The study didn\u2019t look at who was consuming this content, says Hales. But this type of media could pose a risk of adverse mental health outcomes for kids and teens who view it, she notes.",
            "The team also paid attention to skin tone. In the United States, beauty standards traditionally have been linked to ideals of whiteness. The researchers wanted to see if the videos idealized white skin.",
            "The majority of content creators they viewed had light skin. But since TikTok\u2019s feed is driven by an algorithm, the researchers don\u2019t know how well what they saw reflects the whole platform. The early videos they saw and engaged with may have prompted more videos from creators with light skin to appear in their feed.",
            "Some popular terms used in these videos, such as \u201cglowy,\u201d could be seen as coded racial language, they note. While \u201cglowy\u201d is not as overt as \u201cwhite\u201d or \u201clight,\u201d when something glows, it gets brighter and lighter, says Hales.",
            "Next, the team would love to study more videos by non-white creators. \u201cHow much content is there from darker-skinned content creators?\u201d asks Hales. \u201cAre the messages and beauty ideals more affirming?

At that point, she advises teens to talk to their doctor. \u201cPediatricians are usually very equipped to manage mild to moderate acne,\u201d says Hales. If it\u2019s anything more severe, she recommends seeing a dermatologist.",

Second, read the labels of the products you\u2019re using and see what kind of active ingredients they have. Third, look for fragrance-free products, since fragrance is the most common cause of skin allergy.",
            "Hales sees no harm in spending money on safe products that you put on from time to time because it feels luxurious or you enjoy it. But know that you don\u2019t need elaborate skincare routines to take care of your skin. \u201cIn most cases,\u201d she says, \u201cthose products are probably making the skin less healthy, rather than more healthy.\u201d"

Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",
            "To find out, scientists will have to just keep listening. Once they have a robust library of sounds, they may be able to tell most microbes apart. That because microbial sounds are very specific, Harel says. It\u2019s like listening for a friend\u2019s voice in a loud place. Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",

            "Bianca Aridjis-Olivos, a graduate student in his lab, set up air-monitoring equipment atop the university\u2019s meteorology building. It\u2019s surrounded by grand oak trees. It seemed a good location. It\u2019s high above passing cars and other expected pollution sources.",
            "The instruments she used are \u201clike a super-sensitive nose,\u201d she notes. By changing how they operate, she could alter \u201cwhat scents the nose could detect.\u201d Besides ozone, they could pick up nitrogen oxides from combustion (including gasoline-powered vehicles).",
            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

            "Learn why isoprene \u2014 a chemical released by trees (and lots of other plants) \u2014 can make air pollution worse. It\u2019s the second most widely emitted volatile organic chemical (after methane) in the world. The chemistry explained here underlies the data reported in the new study.",
            "Once all her equipment was ready, Aridjis-Olivos waited for the next heat wave.",
            "It hit in August 2024. From August 5 to September 3, she sampled different gases and particles from the air 24 hours a day.",
            "As the temps rose each day, so did levels of ozone, oxygenated volatile organic chemicals (some of which are toxic to human airways) and acid-rich nanoparticles. Ozone levels, in particular, climbed as the heat rose. Then they stayed high throughout the hottest part of the day. That in itself was no surprise. Trees ramp up isoprene release during heat waves. Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",
            "The surprise was just how high the ozone levels climbed. If you just looked at the levels of other pollutants, like the nitrogen oxides from cars, you might think the air was safe to breathe.",
            "And while a heat wave feels miserable, says Zhang, \u201cexposure to both extreme heat and high ozone can be very dangerous.\u201d",
            "This research shows how \u201cclimate change is making air pollution harder to control,\u201d says Russ Dickerson. An atmospheric chemist, he works at the University of Maryland in College Park. Air pollution is a leading cause of death, he notes. The World Health Organization reports that today 99 percent of people worldwide are exposed to air unhealthy enough to pose a risk to our lungs.",
            "Clearly, trees play a role here. But chopping them down would be the wrong conclusion, he adds. \u201cTrees are generally good. But when you mix them with car and truck exhaust, bad things happen.\u201d",

An atmospheric scientist, she works at Howard University in Washington, D.C. With such computer models, she says, \u201cWe can better predict bad-air days during heat waves.\u201d And that should help protect people\u2019s health.",
            "Data from this study are not limited to modeling sites like College Station, Aridjis-Olivos says. Being \u201csurrounded by vegetation, but also some industry and traffic,\u201d this region is similar to what\u2019s found many places, including in many developing nations.",

            "If you can\u2019t avoid a heat wave, how can you protect yourself from air pollution that may come with it? Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible. Remember to check your local air quality index when making plans, Yarber says. \u201cKids are especially sensitive to air pollution,\u201d she notes, \u201cbecause their lungs are still growing.\u201d",
            "At home, Dickerson recommends getting a low-cost HEPA filter from a hardware store. For breathing \u201ccleaner air \u2014 averaged over a day \u2014 put a HEPA filter in your bedroom,\u201d he says. As an alternative, you can even duct-tape five furnace filters together. Then direct air through it with an electric fan. Remember to keep the windows closed.",
            "There are also ways to improve outdoor air quality. For instance, communities can work to limit becoming \u201cheat islands.\u201d Two obvious ways: Increase shaded area, and limit how much heat-absorbing concrete they have.",
            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change? Planting trees.",

And it can be a truly impressive spectacle.",
            "Hail forms high in the clouds during a storm. There, some raindrops freeze solid. As more and more raindrops collide, an icy \u201cstone\u201d grows in size until it\u2019s too heavy to remain aloft.",

            "Researchers are hoping to better understand some of the mysteries of hail. One big question is how hail moves through the atmosphere and builds up in size. Some hailstones have measured more than 13 centimeters (5 inches) across. That\u2019s larger than a softball!",

But such looping motions are actually rare, scientists in China have now shown. They analyzed hailstones collected by citizen scientists.",
            "Since 2016, people had been collecting hailstones across 15 provinces in China. These citizen scientists gathered more than 3,000 of these bits of ice and stored them until people on Qinghong Zhang\u2019s team could retrieve the hail.

The researchers then analyzed the specific isotopes of oxygen present in the frozen water within each layer. By matching that chemistry with the properties of the atmosphere at different heights, they could estimate the paths each ice ball had taken through the sky.",
