            "Scientists have for the first time observed quantum entanglement \u2014 a state in which particles intermingle, losing their individuality so they can no longer be described separately \u2014 between quarks. The feat, achieved at CERN, Europe\u2019s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, could open the door to further probes of quantum information in particles at high energies.",
            "Entanglement has been measured in particles such as electrons and photons for decades, but it is a delicate phenomenon and easiest to measure in low-energy, or \u2018quiet\u2019, environments, such as in the ultracold refrigerators that house quantum computers. Particle collisions, such as those between protons at CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider, are comparatively noisy and high-energy, making it much harder to measure entanglement from their debris \u2014 like listening for a whisper at a rock concert.",
            "\n\nUpgraded LHC begins epic run to search for new physics\n",
            "To observe entanglement at the LHC, physicists working on the ATLAS detector analysed about one million pairs of top and anti-top quarks \u2014 the heaviest of all known fundamental particles and their antimatter counterparts. They found statistically overwhelming evidence for entanglement, which they announced in September last year, and describe in detail today in Nature1. Physicists working on the LHC\u2019s other main detector, CMS, also confirmed the entanglement observation in a report posted to the preprint server arXiv in June2.",
            "\u201cIt is really interesting because it\u2019s the first time you can study entanglement at the highest possible energies obtained with the LHC,\u201d says Giulia Negro, a particle physicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who worked on the CMS analysis.",
            "Scientists have had no doubt that top-quark pairs can be entangled. The standard model of particle physics \u2014 the current best theory of fundamental particles and forces through which they interact \u2014 is built atop quantum mechanics, which describes entanglement. But the latest measurement is nonetheless valuable, researchers say.",
            "\u201cYou don\u2019t really expect to break quantum mechanics, right?\u201d, says Juan Aguilar-Saavedra, a theoretical physicist at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Madrid. \u201cHaving an expected result must not prevent you from measuring things that are important.\u201d",
            "h2Transient tops",
            "During a coffee break years ago, Yoav Afik, an experimental physicist now at the University of Chicago in Illinois, and Juan Mu\u00f1oz de Nova, a condensed-matter physicist now at Complutense University of Madrid, wondered if it was possible to observe entanglement at a collider. Their chat turned into a paper3 that laid out a path to measure entanglement using top quarks.",
            "Pairs of top and anti-top quarks created in the aftermath of a proton collision live infinitesimally short lives \u2014 lasting 10\u221225 seconds. Then they decay into longer-lived particles.",
            "\n\n\u2018The standard model is not dead\u2019: ultra-precise particle measurement thrills physicists\n",
            "Previous studies4 had found that during their short lives, top quarks can have correlated \u2018spin\u2019, a quantum property similar to angular momentum. Afik and Mu\u00f1oz de Nova\u2019s realization was that this measurement could be extended to show that top-quark spins were not somewhat correlated, but truly entangled. They defined a parameter, D, to describe the degree of correlation. If D was less than \u22121/3, the top quarks would be entangled.",
            "Part of what eventually made Afik and Mu\u00f1oz de Nova\u2019s proposal work is the top quarks\u2019 short lifetime. \u201cYou could never do this with lighter quarks,\u201d says James Howarth, an experimental physicist at the University of Glasgow, UK, who was part of the ATLAS analysis along with Afik and Mu\u00f1oz de Nova. Quarks truly dislike being separated, so after a mere 10\u221224 seconds, they start mixing with each other to form hadrons such as protons and neutrons. But a top quark decays quickly enough that it doesn\u2019t have time to \u2018hadronize\u2019 and lose its spin information through mixing, Howarth says. Instead, all of that information \u201cgets transferred to its decay particles\u201d, he adds. This meant that the researchers could measure the properties of decay products to work backwards and infer the properties, including spin, of the parent top quarks.",
            "After making an experimental measurement of the top-quark spins, the teams compared their results with theoretical predictions. But the models of top-quark production and decays didn\u2019t match the detector measurements.",
            "Researchers at both ATLAS and CMS grappled with the uncertainties in different ways. The CMS team, for example, found that adding \u2018toponium\u2019 \u2014 a hypothesized state in which a top and anti-top quark are bound together \u2014 to its analyses helped theory and experiment to agree better.",
            "In the end, both experiments easily met the \u22121/3 entanglement limit, with ATLAS measuring D to be \u22120.537 and CMS measuring \u22120.480.",
            "h2Topping off",
            "The success in observing entanglement in top quarks could improve researchers\u2019 understanding of top-quark physics and pave the way for future high-energy tests of entanglement. Other particles, such as the Higgs boson, could even be used to perform a Bell test, an even more rigorous probe of entanglement.",
            "The top-quark experiment might shift thinking among physicists, Afik says. \u201cAt the beginning it was a bit hard to convince the community\u201d that the study was worth the time, he says. After all, entanglement is a bedrock of quantum mechanics and has been verified time and again.",
            "But the fact that entanglement hasn\u2019t been rigorously explored at high energies is justification enough for Afik and the phenomenon\u2019s other aficionados. \u201cPeople have realized that you can now start to use hadron colliders and other types of colliders for doing these tests,\u201d Howarth says.",

            "\u201cWhat happens with China\u2019s emissions in the next year and next decade is absolutely decisive for the success of the global climate effort,\u201d says Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst who has tracked China\u2019s emissions trends for more than a decade and is a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, a think-tank based in Washington DC.",
            "\u201cOnce China\u2019s emissions peak, it\u2019s likely that global emissions will also reach their peak,\u201d says Dave Jones, an electricity analyst at Ember, a London-based think-tank.",
            "But some researchers say that current peak predictions have big uncertainties owing to various factors, such as the future path of China\u2019s economy. And although reaching the peak will be a major climate milestone, China's emissions must continue to fall to net zero, which could be challenging, say some researchers.",
            "h2Early peak",
            "China reports its greenhouse-gas emissions to the United Nations through a national communication on climate change every four years and a separate report every two years. But those statistics have a major lag, and China\u2019s latest ones were for 2018.",
            "Assessments by Myllyvirta suggest that China\u2019s emissions have been declining since March. This points to a possible 2023 peak, he says, but only if China\u2019s clean-energy production can stick to last year\u2019s record-breaking growth rate in 2024 and its energy consumption drops to its pre-pandemic level. China installed a staggering 217 gigawatts of solar-power capacity in 2023 alone. The United States has installed 137 gigawatts in its entire history.",
            "Myllyvirta calculates China\u2019s monthly CO2 emissions by analyzing energy, industrial and customs data from the Chinese government, industry bodies and commercial companies. Analysts can also estimate how much China\u2019s emissions have changed every year by analyzing data released by China annually, he said. He thinks the current downward trend is largely because of the growth of clean energy.",
            "h2Peak still to come",
            "Modelling by Ryna Cui, a researcher who specializes in coal transition at the University of Maryland in College Park, and her team predicts emissions will peak before 2025. Cui\u2019s team found that rapid deployment of green technologies and shrinking demand for emissions-intensive products, such as steel and cement, are pushing emissions down. But she cautions: \u201cEmissions peaking can be a complex process, with possible small fluctuations, instead of one single point.\u201d",
            "Short-term fluctuations have happened before. China\u2019s emissions declined between 2013 and 2016 after coal use had dropped under a government campaign to tackle air pollution. But a rebound occurred after fossil-fuel consumption went up again.",
            "Other analysts think that it will take another year or so to confidently assess whether China\u2019s recent emissions decline is temporary or the beginning of a long-term trend. \u201cThere are very, very big uncertainties,\u201d says Bill Hare, a climate scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, headquartered in Berlin. Normally, researchers would need five years of emissions data to make a call on a trend, he explains.",
            "h2Life after peak",
            "Peak emissions are just the beginning. China must also double down on its efforts to reduce emissions to net-zero to prevent global warming from getting worse, says Gunnar Luderer, an energy researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. China has pledged to reach this before 2060.",
            "Hare and his colleagues are assessing China\u2019s technology and policy trends to project its emissions trajectory. They forecast two scenarios, one showing emissions staying flat for a few years, whereas in the other, emissions begin to decline. The unknowns include whether China will put many of the coal-power plants it is currently building into operation and how fast it will deploy renewable-energy plants over the next few years.",
            "China approved 83% less coal-power capacity in the first half of 2024 than in the year before, owing to massive renewable advancements, according to a report released in August by the Helsinki-based think-tank Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air and Global Energy Monitor, a non-governmental organization based in Covina, California. This spells a possible end to China\u2019s coal-power capacity expansion in the next few years, once the projects that are under construction and waiting to be built are complete, Cui says.",
            "Although to slash emissions, China will have to wean itself off coal entirely, and Myllyvirta foresees there will be \u201ca lot of opposition from vested interests\u201d in the coal industry, such as state-owned enterprises and local governments.",
            "h2Time pressure",
            "China will have a much shorter time frame to achieve net zero, compared with the European Union and the United States, whose emissions peaked around 1979 and 2005, respectively.",
            "Nevertheless, Sun Yongping, a climate economist at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, is confident about China\u2019s ability to reduce emissions after they peak. \u201cDecarbonization requires two things: technologies and manufacturing capacity to bring these technologies into reality. China has both,\u201d Sun says.",
            "For others, China\u2019s peaking will have a more profound significance. \u201cThe current global emission growth is largely driven by developing countries\u2019 economic expansion,\u201d says Mi Zhifu, a researcher in climate change economics at the University College London. \u201cChina\u2019s experience in decarbonization could offer valuable lessons for other developing nations striving to decouple economic growth from their emissions.\u201d",

            "The goo also prevents insulin from reaching brain neurons that control hunger. Inhibiting production of the goo led mice to lose weight, experiments found. These findings points to a new driver of metabolic disorders and could help scientists to identify targets for drugs to treat these conditions.",

            "Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity can develop when the body\u2019s cells become insensitive to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood-sugar levels. Scientists searching for the mechanism that causes this insulin resistance have homed in on a part of the brain called the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which senses insulin levels and, in response, adjusts energy expenditure and sensations of hunger.",
            "As the animals develop insulin resistance, a type of cellular scaffolding, called the extracellular matrix, that holds the hunger neurons in place becomes a disorganized goo. Previously, researchers had noticed that this scaffolding changes when mice are fed a high-fat diet2.",
            "\n\nMilkshake neuroscience: how the brain nudges us toward fatty foods\n",
            "The researchers wanted to see whether these brain changes might drive insulin resistance rather than merely developing alongside it. The authors fed mice a high-fat, high-sugar diet for 12 weeks and monitored the scaffolding around the hunger neurons by taking tissue samples and monitoring gene activity.",
            "They found that this scaffolding became thicker and stickier within weeks of the mice starting the unhealthy diet. As these animals gained weight, their hypothalamus neurons became less able to process insulin normally, even when the hormone was injected directly into their brains. This suggests that the scaffolding\u2019s stickiness stops insulin from getting into the brain. Instead, \u201cit gets stuck\u201d, says co-author Garron Dodd, a neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne in Australia.",
            "h2Goo loss leads to weight loss",
            "To try to reverse these changes, the researchers injected mice with either an enzyme that digests the goo or a molecule called fluorosamine that inhibits the scaffolding\u2019s formation. Both approaches successfully got rid of the sticky logjam in the animals\u2019 brains, allowing for increased insulin uptake. Fluorosamine even led the animals to shed weight and increase their energy expenditures. Treating insulin resistance by targeting the support structure around neurons might be safer than targeting neurons directly, Dodd says.",
            "\n\nThese brain cells could influence how fast you eat \u2014 and when you stop\n",
            "This \u201chigh quality\u201d study proves \u201cagain and again\u201d that this cellular scaffolding regulates hormonal signalling in a way that directly affects the rest of the body\u2019s metabolism and drives disease, says Kimberly Alonge, a biochemist at the University of Washington School of Pharmacy in Seattle, who was not involved with the study. It also directs the field to focus not only on individual cells and cell types, but also the \u201cpacking material the cells are sitting in\u201d, she adds.",
            "The team\u2019s experiments also showed that inflammation in the hypothalamus drives disruption of the scaffolding, but the study does not address what causes the inflammation to begin with, Alonge says. Previous research has shown that brain cells called glia can affect the structural integrity of the scaffolding, and Alonge would like to know whether glial cells contribute to the inflammation observed in the study.",
            "It\u2019s still unclear how big a part dysfunctional scaffolding plays in causing metabolic disease compared with other well-established drivers of disease, Dodd says. He and his colleagues hope to address this question later.",
            "Future research is needed to investigate whether this goo arises as humans develop metabolic disease. This might pose a challenge, Dodd says, because there is no non-invasive way to access the hypothalamus, which is situated deep in the brain, and it\u2019s a difficult tissue to sample, even from donated organs.",

Rapturous applause met the announcement, made at a seminar at CERN, Europe\u2019s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, which hosts the LHC. The result was ten years in the making, and produced a mass of 80,360.2 million electronvolts for the W boson, which is involved in carrying the weak nuclear force (see \u2018The W boson puzzle\u2019). If the finding had been close to the 2022 result, we would be declaring the standard model\u2019s death, said Bendavid.",

Although the model is incredibly successful, physicists know it can\u2019t be complete, because it doesn\u2019t account for mysterious phenomena such as dark matter.",

It is also in line with the four measurements that preceded the CDF figure, leaving that value as an outlier. \u201cThey cannot both be right,\u201d says Ashutosh Kotwal, an experimental particle physicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who led the CDF study.",

Its mass is one of the few values in the standard model that can be predicted with high precision by theory and measured experimentally. This makes it a great way to hunt for cracks in the standard model. \u201cThere are not many high-precision observables. That\u2019s what makes it important and worthwhile,\u201d says Kotwal.",

The same has to be done for CMS,\u201d he says.",
            "To reach agreement on humankind\u2019s best guess of the W mass, experts from each experiments and theorists will have to come together to try to understand the differing results. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t leave the CDF result as an outlier, we need to understand why or how it is there,\u201d says Canelli.",
            "Although CMS did not find an anomaly, the ten-year process resulted in tools that allow physicists to make other precise measurements. Such high-precision comparisons are what Manca thinks will ultimately break open the standard model.",

So in 2021, he pivoted to neuroscience with the aim of building optical technologies to understand the brain.",
            "Last year, another opportunity turned Carolan\u2019s head. The UK government was setting up a high-risk research funding agency. It was modelled on the famed US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, which helped to pioneer some of the world\u2019s most consequential technologies, including the Internet and personal computers. The UK version, the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA), aimed to mimic that success, except that it avoids DARPA\u2019s connection to military research. ARIA sought its inaugural programme directors with a seductive application question: if you had \u00a350 million in research funding to change the world, what would you do?",
            "Carolan applied, highlighting his interest in developing technologies to treat neurological disorders. He is now one of the first eight programme directors at ARIA, where he has unusual freedom to select the projects that receive money from a 4-year, \u00a3800-million (US$1-billion) budget. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wild journey,\u201d says Carolan.",

            "Formally established in 2023 by an act of Parliament, ARIA is now in its first year of full operation. Its mission is to \u201cempower scientists and engineers to reach for the edge of the possible and unlock breakthroughs that can benefit everyone\u201d, says its chief executive, Ilan Gur, a materials engineer and entrepreneur who moved from Berkeley, California, to lead ARIA in London.",
            "ARIA joins an ecosystem of funders that is dominated by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), a government super-funder with a \u00a39-billion annual budget that oversees discipline-specific research councils, and Innovate UK, which aims to commercialize technologies. But the research councils can be conservative in what they fund, and Innovate UK mainly aids technology transfer, says Paul Nightingale, who studies innovation policy at the University of Sussex near Brighton, UK.",
            "\u201cHaving something that is focused on pushing the boundaries of really extreme, ambitious research \u2014 and having it managed in a DARPA sort of way \u2014 that isn\u2019t something that UKRI really can do,\u201d he says.",
            "UKRI was consulted extensively on ARIA\u2019s creation, says Daniel Shah, chief of investment planning and strategy at UKRI, and the organizations\u2019 leaders connect regularly. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to learn from the ARIA experience, and they\u2019re looking to learn from us,\u201d he says.",

But science-policy specialists say the agency has moved quickly since \u2018exiting stealth mode\u2019, as Gur puts it, last year. Almost all of the directors ARIA recruited have now defined their programme\u2019s research focus. Carolan\u2019s is on precision neurotechnologies; others span topics from artificial intelligence (AI) safety and robotics to engineering plants that are more resilient to pests and climate change.

Bott previously led a precursor to Innovate UK called the Technology Strategy Board, and as far back as 2013, he was part of a UK government fact-finding mission to study DARPA. But the idea came to fruition after appearing as an election-manifesto promise made by Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party in 2019.",
            "Capturing the freedom of DARPA was the guiding principle in ARIA\u2019s design \u2014 just without the focus on defence, says James Phillips, a systems neuroscientist who left research to lay the policy groundwork for ARIA in the UK Prime Minister\u2019s office in 2020.",
            "Although DARPA was founded as ARPA in 1958 by the US government in response to the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite, the defence element became integral to the US agency\u2019s operations. Its ultimate goal was to ensure US technological supremacy on the battlefield. A truth that many in research funding acknowledge is that war is a more urgent incentive for progress than the more general goal of improving society.",
            "But the defence focus is not the only thing that made DARPA successful, says Victor Reis, a retired US government official who directed the agency from 1990 to 1991. Four things were key to DARPA\u2019s effectiveness, says Reis: freedom to make decisions, moving fast, term limits for programme managers and the ability to forge relationships with the most important people in research and industry.",

            "Phillips\u2019s other priority was finding the right leader \u2014 someone with intimate knowledge of the ARPA model. \u201cThe way we described this was a bit like a yoghurt culture. You\u2019ve got to get a bit of the old culture to start the new one,\u201d he says.

            "Most of those spaces have been honed into programmes, such as the one Carolan developed on neurotechnology, which is backed by \u00a369 million. It highlights the burden of neurological diseases, from conditions such as Parkinson\u2019s disease to mental-health disorders. Carolan hopes to help create technologies that will interface with the brain at the circuit level, because most brain disorders are rooted in its wiring, he says.",
            "Essential to success, say the programme directors, is the freedom to fund a diverse community of scientists, technologists and businesses that might work together towards a goal, although taking different approaches. \u201cHow you fund science shapes how you do science,\u201d says Gemma Bale, one of ARIA\u2019s directors.

That appointment was an early indication of success, says Phillips, given Bengio\u2019s sought-after status. The goal of Dalrymple\u2019s programme is to construct an AI \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 system that is tasked with understanding and reducing the risks of other AI agents.",

Laguna de la Vera says that exemption from such requests is a positive for a disruptive funder, in part because many people making the requests might misinterpret what an agency is doing. It also protects competitive interests, he argues. \u201cIt has nothing to do with military innovation or anything, but you want to be secret, right?

            "Exemption from scrutiny is a benefit, but also a risk, says Nightingale. \u201cIt may be that ARIA will invest in areas of research that are controversial, and then there will be pushback,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are always trade-offs.\u201d",

His measure of success is \u201cto de-risk technologies such that other folks can pick it up at the end of the programme\u201d.",

This is made up of three distinct groups that eventually grow into the embryo, the supportive yolk sac and the placenta.",
            "Then the embryo implants itself in the uterus. From about two weeks, embryos go through a process known as gastrulation, in which cells are committed to becoming one of three cell types and organize into layers. These layers differentiate further into lungs, guts, muscles and other organs, in a process known as organogenesis.",
            "\u201cThe embryo is never static,\u201d says Naomi Moris, a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London. \u201cIt undergoes these huge dramatic shifts.\u201d",
            "Researchers have attempted to recreate this epic show in a dish. These efforts \u2014 often done in mice and then in humans \u2014 have typically captured snapshots of the process.",
            "In 2014, researchers coaxed human embryonic stem cells into three distinct rings \u2014 precursors to cells that form the embryo and the placenta1. Later models featured amniotic cavities and yolk sacs, and some were 3D. By 2020, some researchers had recapitulated an aspect of gastrulation2, in which the embryo elongates into a tube-like structure.",

            "h2Writing the rules",
            "Ever since the first embryo models appeared, ethicists have been striving to address the dilemmas that they pose. The International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) developed guidelines in 2021; many countries are considering their own guidelines and legislation.",
            "Australia\u2019s rules are some of the most stringent in the world. In 2020, biochemist Jose Polo, who leads a team based at Monash University in Melbourne and the University of Adelaide, informed Australia\u2019s regulatory body overseeing embryo research, the National Health and Medical Research Council, that he had developed blastoids, and was asked to put the work on hold.",
            "The regulator wanted to assess whether blastoids met the criteria to be considered an embryo under the current laws, which define embryos as biological entities with the potential to develop to a stage, roughly two weeks in, at which a structure called the primitive streak appears and the entity moves towards having a body plan.",
            "\n\nWhat is an embryo? Scientists say definition needs to change\n",
            "Some five months later, the answer came back: they did, said the agency, because of their theoretical potential to develop a primitive streak. As a result, the same limits that apply to research on real embryos would apply to blastoids.",
            "It was a devastating setback, says Polo. His team had to get a specific embryo licence, which bars the group from growing blastoids to study later stages of gastrulation and organogenesis. \u201cI think that they made a mistake,\u201d says Polo about the agency\u2019s ruling. The rules also limit the number of blastoids that can be made, and require stricter consent from those donating cells to be used in them.",
            "Every country is charting its own course. Some points of contrast are how countries define an embryo, whether that definition extends to embryo models and how permissive the rules are to research. Regulators are often guided by rules and norms designed for research on real human embryos when thinking about embryo models, says Megan Munsie, a developmental biologist and bioethicist at Murdoch Children\u2019s Research Institute in Melbourne.",
            "And these discussions often transcend the world of research, finding relevance in other domains, such as reproductive health, abortion, women\u2019s rights and regenerative medicine, says Alfonso Martinez Arias, a developmental biologist at the University Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona, Spain. \u201cOur echo chamber is very large,\u201d he told a room packed with his peers at the annual ISSCR meeting in Hamburg, Germany, in July.",

            "Because embryo models differ in lots of ways from the real structures, most countries treat the two differently. In Spain, for example, the definition of an embryo is based on fertilization, which excludes embryo models, says Nienke de Graeff, a bioethicist at Leiden University Medical Centre, the Netherlands.",
            "Some definitions focus on the embryo\u2019s potential to form or become something else. The ISSCR has said that, based on their potential, embryo models cannot be considered to be embryos, and most countries take a similar view.",
            "Some have proposed revising regulations concerning real embryos to cover some types of embryo model. In the Netherlands, says Nienke, a scientific advisory body proposed a ban on growing the models beyond the equivalent of 28 days in real-embryo terms. France is considering the same limit. Researchers in the United Kingdom did something a little different in July: they published voluntary guidelines for embryo models that do not set fixed limits on how long they can be cultured. The guidelines could eventually lead to the passing of binding legislation \u2014 as happened with similar voluntary UK guidelines around embryo research several decades ago.",
            "The UK guidelines and 2021 ISSCR guidelines do, however, forbid the transfer of human embryo models into a uterus, and several other countries, including Sweden and Japan, are considering introducing similar restrictions.",
            "h2Science accelerates",
            "Meanwhile, the science keeps moving at such a pace that regulators have a lot to keep up with. In June 2024, the ISSCR announced that it had set up a working group to assess the state of the science and review earlier guidelines, in light of the models published since 2021.",
            "In 2023, around half a dozen teams described models that recapitulate the development of embryos just after implantation. Two models in particular were widely covered by the media \u2014 one by Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, a developmental biologist at the California Institute for Technology in Pasadena, and one by Jacob Hanna, a stem-cell biologist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. They were described as complete post-implantation models, but that title has been hotly debated.",
            "\u201cThese are not complete models,\u201d says Rivron. The one by Zernicka-Goetz\u2019s group7 doesn\u2019t have cells that behave like trophoblasts, which provide nutrition for the embryo \u2014 and although Hanna\u2019s8 does contain a trophoblast-like layer, it isn\u2019t as organized as the real thing, say researchers.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a beauty contest \u2014 whose \u2018model\u2019 looked better,\u201d says Jianping Fu, a bioengineer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement, but at the same time, there\u2019s some hype in the field right now.\u201d",
            "Some researchers question the value of chasing a complete model. It\u2019s a \u201cpretty exquisite balancing act\u201d, says Hyun. Researchers want models to resemble an embryo closely enough that they provide real insight into human development but not so closely that they can\u2019t tell the difference between the two, and so risk restrictions to their work. \u201cYou want to skate as close to the edge as possible, without falling over,\u201d he says.",
            "Some researchers try to avoid this ethical dilemma by intentionally introducing changes to their embryo models that would make it impossible for the model to result in an organism. For example, Hanna has started working on models in which genes involved in brain and heart development have been inactivated. He has inferred from discussions with Christian and Jewish leaders in his community that an embryo model lacking brain or heart tissue would not be considered a form of person.",
            "Fu has described a model9 that he says alleviates some of the ethical burdens because, although it reaches gastrulation, it gets there without first forming the primitive streak.",
            "Such models can be insightful and useful, say researchers. One, first published last December, has generated excitement because of how well it reflects some aspects of real embryos10, as well as its direct implications for the clinic. When Mo Ebrahimkhani, a stem-cell bioengineer at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his colleagues grew 3D models on a dish, they noticed the appearance of tiny blood islands. Those islands held the first progenitors of blood cells, including immune cells known as macrophages, platelet-producing cells and cells containing haemoglobin. As Ebrahimkhani has found in unpublished work, these models could be used to produce large amounts of blood stem cells, which could be useful for transplants in people with cancer or genetic diseases.",
            "h2Organ making ",
            "At about three weeks, the embryo starts the momentous organ-growing process that lasts more than a month. Several teams have homed in on aspects of this organogenesis, growing models that resemble only pieces of the embryo \u2014 this has potentially fewer ethical constraints than modelling the whole structure.",
            "One such model11 recapitulates the rhythmic process by which the body forms repeating segments known as somites, which give rise to vertebrae. And earlier this year12, Fu\u2019s team described a model of the neural tube, the progenitor of the central nervous system, complete with a treasure trove of cells, including the precursors to some neurons.",
            "But even these models aren\u2019t without controversy; those that contain nerve cells raise ethical questions around the emergence of sentience, says Hyun.",
            "\n\nWhat\u2019s next for lab-grown human embryos?\n",
            "The next frontier for embryo-like models is to nestle them in environments that more closely resemble the womb, and study how embryos interact with its lining. Researchers have shown that blastoids placed on cells that make up the lining of the uterus can burrow in and fuse correctly. Co-culturing embryo models with this maternal tissue could help models develop as natural embryos would.",
            "Some scientists have gone even further using cells from other animals, including non-human primates. For example, in unpublished work, Liu Zhen, a developmental biologist at the Institute of Neuroscience at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, has grown monkey blastoids in a dish for long enough to reach early organogenesis.",
            "In 2023, Liu transferred blastoids into eight monkeys, three of which experienced the hormone surge observed in early pregnancy13. The blastoids formed gestation sacs but then stopped developing. Cow and mouse blastoids transferred into their respective species also don\u2019t survive long.",
            "There are currently no rules prohibiting the transfer of non-human embryo models into living animals, with the exception of humans, but Hyun worries that if such transfers do lead to a live birth, that will cause a backlash against the research and have a detrimental effect on studies using human embryo models. The intellectual leap from monkey to humans is easy to make, he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually have to do the human experiment to have a pretty major concern.\u201d",
            "h2When is it an embryo? ",
            "Most researchers agree that today\u2019s human embryo models are nowhere near the real thing. The key challenge for researchers who are developing guidelines is determining \u201cwhen an embryo model would be considered equivalent to an embryo\u201d, says Amander Clark, a developmental and stem-cell biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-chairs the ISSCR\u2019s working group on embryo models.",
            "Given that ethical norms prohibit the transfer of embryo models into a uterus to see whether they can give rise to an organism, researchers are coming up with other tests of their potential. Some groups are developing tools to better compare embryo models with real embryos, for example by looking at the cells\u2019 RNA profiles. But even these gene-expression exercises can miss key information, says Hanna, such as the positions of cells in an embryo.",
            "Assessing and improving models is important for science, as well as for ethics, says Fredrik Lanner, a stem-cell and developmental biologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. If the models aren\u2019t good, then they\u2019re not useful, he says. It\u2019s \u201creally critical now for us to not waste time on bad models\u201d.",
            "That standard setting is especially important as the field starts to offer real insights into early embryonic development. There have already been some surprises, says Moris. Most notable is the ability of cells to switch personas \u2014 their plasticity \u2014 and their capacity to self-organize, often without the aid of extra-embryonic tissue.",
            "Some models are even revealing new phenomena. Researchers have long known that, in some mammals, embryos that are fertilized in the summer \u2018hibernate\u2019 and restart development later so that the young are born in the spring. In unpublished work, Rivron and his colleagues have been able to cajole human blastoids into this state of suspended development.",
            "But so far, he says, embryo models have not led to scientific discoveries of societal value, and it\u2019s not clear which models will help researchers get there.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of debate, arguments, especially drama, in the past\u201d, along the lines of \u201cmy model is better than yours\u201d, says Wu. The reality is that every model is imperfect, but every one is useful, he says. It just depends on what the question is.",

Ratcheting up concerns is the fact that no Missouri dairy farms have reported a bird flu outbreak; this might be because there really are no infections, or because the state does not require farmers to test their cows for the virus.",

That person did not become severely ill and has recovered from the infection. Tests revealed it to be H5N1 influenza, often referred to as bird flu.",
            "Since March, when the H5N1 virus was first detected in US dairy cattle, there have been more than a dozen cases of human infection that were traced back to contact with infected animals, including cows and birds. The Missouri case stands out because investigators found no such link and no tie to unprocessed food products, such as raw milk, from potentially infected livestock.",
            "\n\nIf bird flu sparks a human pandemic, your past immunity could help\n",
            "This raised the possibility that the virus might have evolved to not only infect humans, but also to spread between people. If so, this increases the risk of it sweeping through human populations, potentially triggering a dangerous outbreak.",

A key next step will be to test all three people for antibodies against the strain of H5N1 bird flu that has been infecting cattle. Such antibodies, particularly in the two contacts, would be definitive evidence of past infection.",

That protein sits on the surface of influenza viruses, where it helps the viruses bind to and infect host cells. It is also a target of flu vaccines.",

That sugar, he says, could then act as an umbrella, shielding the swath of hemagglutinin beneath it. It is a change that his laboratory has studied in other flu strains, and it could affect how the virus binds to host cells \u2014 as well as whether vaccines being developed against the H5N1 virus found in cattle can recognize and perform well against the virus detected in Missouri.",

Previous studies1,2 had suggested that changes to a gene encoding a protein responsible for copying the viral genome could be crucial for allowing the virus to replicate in mammalian cells. But researchers were unable to sequence that gene from the isolate from Missouri.",

Testing of cattle also needs to be improved so that public-health officials will know which regions of the country to surveil for infections in humans, says Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. In the United States, most testing of cattle is regulated at the state level, but only a handful of states have required routine testing on some dairy farms.",

            "Some barriers are falling, however. Steady work to improve transplant protocols has boosted success rates and lowered toxicity, says Michael DeBaun, who specializes in treating sickle-cell disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. In November, DeBaun and his colleagues showed that stem cells from only partially matched donors \u2014 such as a parent \u2014 could be transplanted successfully in people with sickle-cell disease who received a lower-than-usual dose of radiation and chemotherapy before the procedure2.",
            "At the same time, gene-targeting therapies have also progressed. One therapy, called Lyfgenia (lovotibeglogene autotemcel), provides a working version of the gene that is affected in people with the disorder. The other therapy, called Casgevy (exagamglogene autotemcel), uses CRISPR\u2013Cas9 genome editing to reactivate a form of haemoglobin that is normally inactivated soon after birth. This fetal haemoglobin helps to compensate for the dysfunctional version.",
            "Neither of these gene therapies corrects the mutation that causes sickle-cell disease, and neither can be considered a cure. But both drastically reduce the incidence of acute pain crises in people who receive treatment, and there is hope that those benefits will be long-lasting. In December 2023, biotechnology company Bluebird Bio in Somerville, Massachusetts, which makes Lyfgenia, reported that the therapy\u2019s benefits were durable for at least five years3. The company continues to follow participants in its clinical trials to see how long the effects last.",
            "h2Treatment at a price",
            "All of the treatments are expensive: a stem-cell transplant costs between about US$100,000 and $400,000 and the list price of Casgevy, which was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in Boston, Massachusetts, and CRISPR Therapeutics in Zug, Switzerland, is $2.2 million. Such price tags mean that these therapies are out of reach for many people with sickle-cell disease around the world. In the United States, an effort is under way to make cell and gene therapies available to people who receive publicly funded health care. The programme is slated to go into effect in 2025, but it is not yet clear how many states will take part in it. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence determined in March that Casgevy is not cost-effective for treating sickle-cell disease and asked the developers for further data. As a result, Casgevy is not yet available for treating sickle-cell disease through the country\u2019s public health-care system.",
            "Both stem-cell transplants and gene therapy require chemotherapy before the treatment. Chemotherapy is time-consuming and risky. Women who go through it are often left infertile. They can opt to have their eggs frozen before treatment, but in the United States, the harvesting, freezing and storage of eggs typically costs more than $10,000.",
            "\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a vote for hope\u2019: first gene therapy for muscular dystrophy nears approval, but will it work?\n",
            "That price was too high for Teonna Woolford, who once dreamed of having six children \u2014 before she received a stem-cell transplant at the age of 19. By then, her sickle-cell disease was landing her in hospital about every other week. She\u2019d had both hips replaced because of bone damage caused by impaired blood flow and her liver was failing. Her doctors urged her to consider a stem-cell transplant.",
            "Woolford, who lives in a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, reached out to a few cancer charities that offer assistance to try and retain fertility for women undergoing chemotherapy. \u201cI don\u2019t have cancer, but I\u2019m getting chemo and radiation,\u201d she explained. \u201cMaybe you can squeeze me in?\u201d The answer was no.",
            "In addition to infertility, the chemotherapy can increase the risk of bone degeneration, which is already elevated in people with sickle-cell disease. The chemotherapy regimen can also raise the risk of cancer. DeBaun is hopeful that new transplant protocols that use lower doses of chemotherapy will reduce the chances of these side effects.",
            "As for gene therapies, researchers say it is important to follow recipients for years after their treatment to monitor for any increase in cancer rates, either from the chemotherapy regimen or the gene therapy itself. Lyfgenia carries a warning about cancer risk because two clinical-trial participants later developed leukaemia. Long-term data will be crucial to determine whether either Lyfgenia or Casgevy truly pose a cancer risk, or whether such cases are associated with the underlying sickle-cell trait, which might also predispose people to blood cancers, says Mark Walters, a paediatric haematologist and oncologist at the University of California, San Francisco.",
            "For now, it\u2019s difficult to tease these risks apart because the clinical trials have been relatively small, and could not include a control group, says James LaBelle, a paediatric oncologist at the University of Chicago Medicine in Illinois. Participants in clinical trials were also carefully selected, he notes, and lacked some of the organ damage or history of stroke that might be present in people with severe sickle-cell disease, making it hard to know how well the gene therapies will work \u2014 and how safe they will be \u2014 in that population.",
            "h2Looking to the long term",
            "As the therapies expand from clinical trials to hospitals, there is an opportunity to collect data that would address these questions, LaBelle says. The FDA has suggested that gene-therapy manufacturers should collect data from the recipients of their products for up to 15 years after treatment. Researchers outside those companies are also setting up a registry to track recipients of sickle-cell gene therapies, he adds.",
            "But a lingering question is how to capture those data in the first place. Cell- and gene-therapy recipients often remain in the care of their transplant team for some time after their treatment. But they eventually return to their regular health-care providers, who might not know the full medical history of their patients, or the testing and data reporting expectations for someone who has received a gene therapy.",

            "Then there is the difficulty of getting people with sickle-cell disease, some of whom are traumatized by hospitals and medical procedures, to come back every year for a follow-up examination, says Walters. \u201cSome of the recipients just feel like, \u2018I\u2019m done with sickle-cell disease. The last thing I want to do is give you blood samples\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to motivate participation.\u201d",
            "Long-term follow-up is a struggle for the wider gene-therapy field, too. Jack Grehan, a videographer in Manchester, UK, was treated for a blood-clotting disorder called haemophilia A more than five years ago. For the first few years after receiving the therapy, he returned to the hospital for follow-up exams each time he was asked to come. But now he lives two hours away from the treatment centre and is juggling childcare and a new job. He has not had a single bleeding episode since receiving the treatment, and he stopped going to check-ups two years ago. \u201cI\u2019ll happily go back and give them more once my life balances back out,\u201d he says.",
            "But in the years after Grehan was treated in a clinical trial, researchers found that the effects of the gene therapy he received can wane over time. As a result, physicians often urge recipients to have their blood-clotting proteins checked routinely. When first approached by Nature in March, Grehan was unaware of that concern.",
            "h2Improve support for chronic issues",
            "And some people will require continued care. Many with sickle-cell disease who receive transplants find fast relief from crippling, acute pain crises, but the chronic pain from decades of damage to organs and nerves can take much longer to address. \u201cIt can be such a source of disappointment for people because it doesn\u2019t go away magically in three months,\u201d says Walters. \u201cThe pain-sensation network in sickle cell is really disordered.\u201d",
            "Jones\u2019s story of being refused care for her pain after her transplant echoes what several physicians and sickle-cell-disease advocates have told Nature. Stem-cell transplants or gene therapy can make the blood seem remarkably normal in recipients, says Sharma. \u201cBut they truly still have pain,\u201d he says, \u201cand this is something that emergency-room physicians or other clinicians are unable to grapple with.\u201d",
            "\n\nGene therapy\u2019s comeback: how scientists are trying to make it safer\n",
            "Over time, many people will find relief even from chronic pain through therapy and pain-management techniques, without having to rely on the opioids they might have been prescribed before the transplant, says Lakshmanan Krishnamurti, a paediatric haematologist and oncologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. But it can take hard work to get there, and health-care plans often do not cover the cost of that journey. It\u2019s especially difficult for people from disadvantaged communities. \u201cYou do gene therapy and then throw these people back in the same environment. Why should I be surprised they don\u2019t have access to pain management?\u201d he says.",
            "And there are mental-health challenges to navigate, too. After noticing that many transplant recipients seemed to struggle after their procedures, Elisabeth Dovern, a haematologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center, and her colleagues conducted a survey of health challenges that arise after a transplant.",
            "The team found that most transplant recipients reported positive changes, including improvements in physical, mental and social health. But even among those who were happy with the outcome, some people struggled. Chronic pain and bone degeneration remained a problem for some recipients, as did feelings of isolation4. A lifetime of illness had made the hospital a source of trauma for some. They faced symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder now that the ordeal was largely over. For others, the hospital was a second home, and they mourned the loss of that community when their health improved, says Dovern.",
            "\n\nThe sickle-cell drug boon\n",
            "Many recipients of cell or gene therapy feel like they need to fill the space left by the condition they had spent a lifetime fighting. \u201cThe disease becomes the narrative,\u201d says Krishnamurti. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to change the narrative of a life.\u201d",
            "Dovern expects her findings for transplant recipients to translate to the experiences of those who receive gene therapy for sickle-cell disease. Indeed, recipients of other forms of gene therapy have wrestled with similar problems. Dovern and her colleagues now assign recipients of stem-cell transplants a psychiatric counsellor who meets with them before and after the procedure to help buffer the shock of the transition to a new life. Krishnamurti spends months preparing people not only for the procedure, but also for the turmoil that can come afterwards. \u201cYou describe yourself as a sickle-cell warrior? Your training to become a sickle-cell veteran starts now,\u201d he tells them.",
            "Late last year, when many sickle-cell-disease advocates were celebrating the FDA approvals of gene therapies, Woolford decided to start a support group for people who received transplants or gene therapy. The group has about 25 members. Jones has also formed a support group that is about ten members strong. \u201cI needed to feel like I still had support within the sickle-cell community,\u201d she says.",
            "The members of Jones\u2019s support group share stories and experiences, sifting out the misinformation they encounter along the way. In a recent virtual gathering, the group marvelled over Supacell, a drama series on streaming service Netflix in which a group of Black Londoners with sickle-cell disease in their families develop superpowers. They groaned in sympathy when one member recalled their struggles to get physicians to take their condition seriously.",
            "Jones says that she is still trying to work out how best to make her voice heard by health-care providers unaccustomed to treating people with sickle-cell disease after a transplant. \u201cLong-term care is often overlooked,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does take a while for the body to catch up \u2014 and for the mind to get there, too.\u201d",

            "Although climate change is an important driver of the disease outbreaks, it is not the sole culprit. Increased travel, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, is aiding the transmission of viruses across borders. The rise in dengue cases in Europe is partly a side effect of record outbreaks in other parts of the world: South and Central America are currently battling their worst-ever dengue season, with cases in 2024 already 228% higher than they were at the same time last year.",

            "In a darkened room in Rochester, N.Y., a baby girl in a pink onesie watches a computer screen. Wherever she looks, an eye tracker follows. It records what she looks at and for how long.",
            "The baby, about 6 months old, is neither deaf nor hard of hearing. And she\u2019s never seen any kind of sign language before. But somehow, she and others her age\u00a0can tell the difference between gestures and formal signs. When a woman onscreen uses American Sign Language, these young babies usually stare at her hands. When she makes non-sign gestures, babies often look at her face or look away.",
            "\u201cI thought it was pretty remarkable,\u201d says experimental psychologist Rain Bosworth. She works at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In 2022, she and her team shared these findings in\u00a0Frontiers in Psychology. Their work suggests that babies are born with the ability to notice sign language and ready to learn any language, spoken or signed.",
            "That idea can be hard to believe, she says. After all, we live in a hearing-centric world.",
            "\u201cThere is a bias to think of spoken language as somehow superior to signed language.\u201d But that\u2019s just not true, she says. \u201cSign language is a full and real language, just as powerful as English.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/KyaRyDWVUzA?feature=oembed",
            "Researchers tracked where babies look (red dots) as they watch a computer screen. Rain Bosworth\u2019s team used these data to figure out what captures a baby\u2019s attention. Infants around 6 months old, for example, tend to lock their eyes on the hands of people using American Sign Language.",
            "Bosworth investigates how people learn and process sign language. She studies how both deaf and hearing people use vision and touch. With this and other research, she tries to understand how early experiences shape the ways kids grow and learn. She might ask, for example, what happens if a kid sees their parents using sign language, or hears technical, scientific terms at home. Will that change how the child develops?",
            "In 2022, Bosworth established a new research lab at RIT\u2019s National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID). She named it PLAY Lab (for Perception, Language and Attention in Youth). She\u2019s passionate about changing negative perceptions of sign language and deaf people. Deaf herself, Bosworth feels she\u2019s the right person to come up with study questions. She tells me this via interpreters on Zoom. \u201cI think about science nonstop, 24/7.\u201d",
            "Bosworth\u2019s career shows how determined she is, says Karen Emmorey. Emmorey is a cognitive neuroscientist. She works at San Diego State University in California. Deaf researchers can face challenges hearing people may never consider. For example, they often need to arrange interpreters for lectures, meetings, social events \u2014 and interviews. But Bosworth is stubborn, Emmorey says. \u201cShe\u2019s going to persevere and do what she needs to do to succeed.\u201d",
            "More than nine in every 10 deaf kids in the United States have parents who can hear. Even today, Bosworth says, it\u2019s not uncommon for physicians and other professionals (such as audiologists) to advise these parents to avoid sign language. Instead, kids are encouraged to get cochlear (KO-klee-ur) implants and to learn to read lips.",
            "There\u2019s this incorrect thought that sign language will impair speech development, Bosworth says. Yet recent evidence, she says, suggests that learning sign language may actually\u00a0boost a child\u2019s spoken vocabulary.",
            "Bosworth was born in San Francisco, Calif., to hearing parents. She grew up in Los Angeles, Calif. Her school did not allow sign language. Her first brush with it came on the school bus, when she was 6 or 7 years old. She and other deaf kids made up their own signs to communicate. That cracked the door to a rich new world of visual language.",
            "A friend she later met in high school kicked that door wide open. Bosworth\u2019s friend was deaf and so were her parents and siblings. \u201cI was like, \u2018This is the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u2019\u201d she remembers thinking.",

It serves more than 1,100 deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Students, faculty and staff there use sign language in classrooms, laboratories and public spaces. Before arriving, many kids had been the only deaf people in their schools, Bosworth says. They often struggled with feeling alone or left out. They faced many barriers to learning.",
            "Now, \u201cthey\u2019re definitely on cloud nine,\u201d she says, describing their feelings of happiness and excitement. \u201cThis is like a second home to them.\u201d",
            "It\u2019s a second home for Bosworth too. At NTID, she can unspool her curiosity and let it fly. Bosworth is proud to help create a sense of inclusion. \u201cI\u2019m able to be a role model to all of these students of what a deaf person can do.\u201d",
            "Bosworth\u2019s research is filling in a more complete picture of how deaf and hearing kids acquire language, says linguist Jenny Singleton. At Stony Brook University in New York, she studies how people learn sign language. Bosworth found that language learning changes as children grow and take in new information. For instance, non-signing babies who can hear tend to lose their innate ability to tell the difference between signs and gestures. This happens at around one year old. Her team has also found that these older babies no longer pay special attention to\u00a0certain types of fingerspelled words.",
            "Both results suggest that the window for learning sign language closes somewhat with age. This is similar to spoken languages.",
            "While still a graduate student at the University of California, San Diego, Bosworth examined the visual abilities of deaf adults. Now, she combines the study of linguistics and visual perception \u201cin a really impressive way,\u201d Singleton says.",
            "Bosworth also is investigating how kids explore the world and how they play. How does a child\u2019s background and hearing status influence their behaviors? Do deaf kids rely on their sense of touch more than hearing kids do? Do specific types of play affect how children learn language?",
            "For Bosworth, it\u2019s not enough to make scientific strides in a field dominated by hearing people. She wants to bring deaf people along and mentor kids. \u201cI want them to get on this research bus with me,\u201d she says.",
            "Over time, she hopes for more deaf role models at universities. She also wants to see more research that casts deaf people in a positive light. Her research already highlights their strengths rather than looking for shortcomings.",
            "Savannah Tellander is a graduate student in Bosworth\u2019s lab. She is hard of hearing. In grade school, she sometimes felt as if teachers assumed she wasn\u2019t as smart as other kids. \u201cThey would usually doubt me before they ever met me,\u201d she says. Those kinds of experiences are part of what drew her to Bosworth\u2019s lab.",

            "Like Bosworth, Tellander wants to teach people how to support deaf kids\u2019 thought processes and language. And she was impressed from the get-go with Bosworth\u2019s zest for mentoring.",
            "Tellander remembers first meeting Bosworth at NTID. She\u2019d just moved from California. She had no friends or family nearby. Bosworth\u2019s eyes lit up talking about her own experiences with her adviser. \u201cShe was really, really excited to be a mentor,\u201d Tellander recalls.",
            "On any given day, she says, you may find Bosworth helping students write a research proposal, teaching them how to make a poster of their results or finding time outside of work to attend a friend\u2019s art show.",
            "It\u2019s important to Bosworth that deaf students know that they have their own strengths. Despite what the world may be telling them, they can lead successful lives. \u201cI see deafness as a life experience that shapes who we are just like any other cultural experience,\u201d Bosworth says. \u201cI think that being deaf is wonderful.\u201d"

They\u2019d put their feet in the air and cry, \u201cOur feet are hot!\u201d Their games had been played on artificial turf. This heat-trapping plastic can get so hot it burns. A new water-storage system that Cirkel\u2019s Dutch research team has just developed works to avoid that problem.",

One hot June day, the surface of regular artificial grass soared to 62.2\u00b0 Celsius\u00a0(144\u00b0 Fahrenheit)! That was 25 degrees C (45 degrees F) hotter than regular grass.

            "Rigid plastic blocks in the water-storage zone have holes to let water enter. The blocks clip together a bit like thin Lego bricks. Linking the water-storage layer to the filler above is a cone of wicking fiber. It\u2019s made from rock wool.",

The only filler that didn\u2019t move water well was the conventional rubber (the standard filler in fields topped by artificial turf). Only about 1 millimeter (0.04 inch) of the stored water evaporated from its surface each day.",
            "For their outdoor tests, the researchers created four small fields in the city of Amsterdam. Each was five meters (16 feet) on a side.

These include \u201cforever chemicals\u201d called PFAS and hydrocarbons (the building blocks of most plastics). Players will still be exposed to these, Vasilou notes.

            "The rain-cooled system was a big improvement over today\u2019s fake grass. And in the outdoor tests, rain fell often enough to supply all the water the system needed. But in hotter, drier cities, the system may need irrigation, as real grass does.",

            "A shooting star is normally a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it event. That space rock, or meteor, leaves a fiery trail of light as it zips through the atmosphere. Then it\u2019s gone. But sometimes, a lasting afterglow remains for minutes. For more than a century, astronomers have wondered why some meteors leave such \u201cpersistent trains.\u201d Now, they at last may have the answer.\u00a0",
            "To leave a lasting trail, meteors need to aim low. Space rocks that fall to about 90 kilometers (56 miles) above the ground before burning up boast lasting afterglows. But those that burn up higher in the atmosphere don\u2019t. These data come from a new survey of persistent meteor trains. Astronomers shared their new findings in the July issue of\u202fJournal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.\u00a0",
            "Amateur astronomers often record such trails \u201cas a nice movie,\u201d says Gunter Stober. This astrophysicist, who works at the University of Bern in Switzerland, did not take part in the new meteor survey. He concludes that it\u2019s \u201creally the first more comprehensive, total overview of [shooting star observations].\u201d\u00a0",
            "Persistent trains form when metals that have burned off an incoming space rock react chemically with a form of oxygen \u2014 ozone (O3) \u2014 in the air. These O3 reactions give off heat and light. These can keep a meteor train aglow for up to an hour.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Studies in the 1940s and 1950s suggested that such trains were rare. Only one in every 750 meteors was thought to produce one. And persistent trains were mostly associated with the brightest shooting stars.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "More recent studies have focused on the\u202fLeonid meteor storms in the early 2000s. Those were the most dramatic such showers in decades. Only the fastest meteors leave trains, these studies found. These were space rocks zinging through the air at speeds of around 70 kilometers (43 miles) per second.\u00a0",
            "But such surveys had their limits. Some were too broad, including one-off views of meteors from observers around the world. Others were too narrow; they might focus on just one spectacular meteor shower.\u00a0",

            "For the new survey, researchers set up a camera to stare at the same patch of sky above New Mexico for nearly two years. From October 2021 to July 2023, it recorded every light streak that crossed its field of view.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In that time, the camera saw nearly 7,500 meteors. About 850 of them \u2014 around one in every eight meteors \u2014 left persistent trains. One in 19 meteors left trains lasting more than five minutes.\u00a0",
            "That was surprising for two reasons. First, way more of the shooting stars left persistent trains than had been expected. Second, the meteors leaving those trains had all sorts of speeds and brightnesses.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Previously, many scientists had held that \u201cthese persistent trains were only formed by the fast, bright meteors,\u201d says Logan Cordonnier. He\u2019s an astrophysicist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \u201cWe found that it doesn\u2019t need to be fast,\u201d the new survey\u2019s leader says. In fact, he notes, \u201cMost of the persistent trains were formed by slower meteors.\u201d\u00a0",
            "The real factor that determined whether a shooting star left a lasting train was ozone, he says.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Meteors that zipped down to altitudes of 90 kilometers were far more likely to leave trains than those that burned up higher in the atmosphere. That key altitude of 90 kilometers is above the ozone layer in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. There is a little ozone at that height, Cordonnier says, just not nearly as much as below it.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In theory, meteors passing through the ozone layer, below, could also leave trails. But few make it that far down without burning up completely.\u00a0",
            "Future views of persistent trains could help probe the chemistry of Earth\u2019s atmosphere around 90 kilometers up. It\u2019s a mysterious layer of air. Cordonnier likens it to \u201cthe spot in your back where you can\u2019t itch.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Basically, \u201cit\u2019s too high in the atmosphere for weather balloons. And it\u2019s too low for satellites to take direct measurements,\u201d Cordonnier says. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult region to probe.\u201d Persistent trains, though, \u201chappen for free, all the time,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe just have to look.\u201d\u00a0",

            "One idea is that tiny, electrically charged dust grains knocked off of a space rock might produce an electric field that keeps the train together. A closer look at the new catalog and others could help prove this notion right or wrong.\u00a0",

            "A black hole packs a huge amount of mass into a very tiny space. As a result, its gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. All known black holes are made of matter. But Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity says that matter and energy are just two different forms of the same thing. (This is what is expressed in the famous equation E = mc2.) So in theory, a black hole could be made out of densely packed energy \u2014 light \u2014 rather than matter. This would be a kugelblitz, which is German for \u201cball lightning.\u201d",
            "But new research suggests that the rules of quantum physics would keep kugelblitzes from forming. According to quantum physics, when light gets too highly concentrated, something strange happens. Electrons and their antimatter partners (positrons) start to form. Those particles could then escape a region of densely packed light, taking energy with them. That would keep light from ever concentrating enough to form a black hole. Not even the superbright centers of active galaxies could produce light intense enough to overcome this limit.",

Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",

The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch. Technically, the\u00a0frequency\u00a0of a wave describes how many cycles of the wave happen during a certain amount of time. This is measured in\u00a0hertz, or cycles per second. On average, the frequency range for human hearing is from 20\u00a0hertz at the low end to 20,000\u00a0hertz at the high end. Figure 2 shows examples of sound waves of two different frequencies. The\u00a0period\u00a0in the wave is the time that it takes for a single cycle of the wave to pass.

Note that Helmholtz resonators are different from\u00a0air columns, or containers where the opening is the same width as the rest of the container (similar to musical instruments like clarinets). The frequency of the sound wave generated by a Helmholtz resonator depends on the geometry of the opening (its area and length) as well as the volume of air inside the cavity.

The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

Depending on the situation, participants had to choose whether to get away, to block entry to a shelter spot and hide, or to fight to counter an attack.\u00a0",
            "For each of several cases, a shooter tried to enter a classroom and shoot plastic pellets at as many people as possible. When people could only hide, the classroom attacks lasted from 22 seconds to almost five minutes. On average, almost three in every four people got shot in those cases. When people had choices, the average time for the classroom attacks was 16 seconds, and an average of just one in every four inside got shot.

Researchers at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., based their model on the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. In that attack, two teens killed 13 people and then themselves.

One of its authors works for the ALICE Institute, which makes money doing shooter drills and training. Jonson and the other co-author were certified trainers for the ALICE program. Plus, the study participants were already going through training at the ALICE Institute, and only a few were educators. (Jonson did say that her team took some steps to reduce bias. The \u201cshooter\u201d was not with the ALICE program, and instructions were very specific, for example. Yet the group studied was not a random sample.)",
            "More generally, Trump says, options-based training for students \u201cfails to consider age and developmental factors.\u201d It also fails to consider other variables, such as children who might have special needs (such as being deaf or needing a wheelchair). Students may give shooters more targets if they run. And a majority of school shooters have not been subdued by citizens. Some school employees also have been injured in options-based shooter drills, he adds. In contrast, lockdowns focus on securing classrooms and avoiding more risky situations. In his view, \u201clockdowns work and are the gold standard in best practices for more than two decades.\u201d",

Still, young students didn\u2019t really understand why they did the drills. After the Sandy Hook shooting, that changed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t reassuring once I realized what we were doing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt became more creepy.\u201d And it felt like schools were treating shootings as something almost normal. Nonetheless, she says, \u201cI was glad I had at least something to fall back on in case there was an emergency.\u201d",

            "Some experts also worry that drills could cause emotional harm. In a 2007 study, Nickerson and a colleague looked at the short-term effects of an intruder drill. Two groups of 4th-, 5th- and 6th-grade students learned about the steps. Then they practiced the drill. Teachers locked classroom doors and shut off the lights. Students moved into corners. Everyone tried to stay quiet.\u00a0",
            "Afterward, the team gave a five-question quiz to those students and two other groups that didn\u2019t do the drills. The groups that practiced had more knowledge about what to do for a drill. And their anxiety levels were not much different from those in kids from the other groups. The team concluded that similar drills could increase children\u2019s short-term knowledge and give them useful skills to use in a real crisis.\u00a0",

Typical lockdown drills can be done calmly without raising anxiety levels in most students, she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t promise that nothing bad is ever going to happen.

Students have cowered as alarms blared and masked \u201cgunmen\u201d shot blanks or starter guns. Some schools have had students play shooting victims. Teens at one charter high school in Colorado even practiced how to take down a mock gunman.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe don\u2019t light a fire in the hallway to practice fire drills,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cAnd we do not have to shoot off a safety gun or have screaming to simulate what it\u2019s like to be in an active-shooter situation.\u201d And while a drill might not be stressful for most students, it could stress some. \u201cIf your school is asking you to participate in a highly sensorial drill,\u201d she says, \u201cyou have a right to say no if you are uncomfortable.\u201d",
            "Schools also should give students and parents some warning about when drills will happen. \u201cThere should never, ever be an unannounced, highly sensorial drill,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cThere should never be an unannounced lockdown drill.\u201d Indeed, unannounced drills have caused some kids to run from schools. Panicky 911 calls followed.",
            "If done well, a lockdown drill can lower anxiety and teach students good, adaptive behaviors for when a bad situation arises, Brock says. And the options of evacuating or hiding also can serve other, less scary purposes. For instance, such procedures might deal with something like a strange dog on the premises.",
            "However, Brock recommends against having armed-assailant or active-shooter drills for elementary-school students. And he\u2019s wary about using them with students in middle school and high school. If a student has a history of trauma or is already anxious, depressed or stressed, \u201cthese drills are going to be upsetting.\u201d Some students might have had friends or family members who were victims of gun violence.\u00a0",

            "When Chardon High School resumed drills after the 2012 shooting, there were no real gunshots, Siegel-Green says. Parents could choose to keep students home. Counselors were on hand to talk with students. Comfort dogs were also available for at least one drill after the shooting. However, not all schools offer that type of follow-up. Julia says students at her school generally knew they could see a counselor if they felt stressed. Still, it wasn\u2019t emphasized.\u00a0",
            "\u201cIn most cases, people participate in these drills and don\u2019t get more anxious and fearful. But that could certainly happen.

Other groups aim to decrease bullying. Some school shooters had been victims of bullying.",
            "When it comes to school violence, \u201cthere are often warning signs,\u201d says a February 2020 report from the Everytown Gun Safety Support Fund and teacher and student groups. Spotting those signs can help educators take action to prevent violence before it happens.",

            "Other prevention efforts aim to beef up school security. Many schools have limited entry to no more than one or two doors. Many have added security cameras. Some schools also have added metal detectors and even armed staff members or regular police patrols. It\u2019s unclear whether such measures make students much safer or just introduce extra risk. Their impacts on students also vary. A lot depends on the particular community.\u00a0",

She says her last year of high school in Parkland \u201cwas pretty uncomfortable for kids that looked like me.\u201d The school didn\u2019t have metal detectors, but it added some armed guards with rifle cases. \u201cThat\u2019s really uncomfortable and triggering for people that were directly impacted by the shooting,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd also uncomfortable for students of color because we are not greeted nicely by police officers.\u201d",
            "In any case, she argues, extra school-security steps and shooter drills are \u201cjust a Band-Aid on the real issue.\u201d Mass shootings at schools and other places are terrible tragedies. Yet they account for fewer than two in every 100 U.S. gun deaths, data from the Pew Research Center show. Those shootings get lots of media attention. Yet there are many more gun deaths from suicide, domestic violence and other murders.\u00a0",

            "Even if most students are okay with doing active-shooter drills at school, some students will likely find them troubling.",
            "About 95 percent of U.S. public schools hold drills to prepare for possible shooters, says the National Center for Education Statistics. So far, there are no clear standards for those drills. Some run-throughs have been intense, with loud alarms, shots and make-believe shooters and victims. Others have been more subdued. Teachers and students practiced finding safe shelter inside locked classrooms or other places. Researchers are still studying the effectiveness of different types of drills. Meanwhile, some experts have concerns about the emotional impacts that these precautionary drills might have on students.",
            "If done well, a lockdown drill can lower anxiety in students. It also can teach them good, adaptive behaviors for that time when a bad situation might arise, says Stephen Brock. He\u2019s a school psychologist at California State University, Sacramento. And knowing what to do can help in case of any emergency.",
            "But some kids may find a shooter drill troubling. They may already have had trauma in their lives. Other students may suffer from anxiety, depression or other mental-health issues. Still others might just find the situation creepy. Or, they might feel that shooter drills somehow make gun violence seem normal. Here are a few ways to cope.",
            "Realize that school shootings are very, very rare. \u201cThis is something we do to keep you safe in school,\u201d says Amanda Nickerson of the drills. She\u2019s a psychologist at the University at Buffalo in New York. A school shooting is \u201cvery, very unlikely, but this is the kind of thing we would do if that were to happen.\u201d",
            "You can say no. \u201cIf your school is asking you to participate in a highly sensorial drill, you have a right to say no if you are uncomfortable,\u201d says Melissa Reeves. She\u2019s a school psychologist at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C. By sensorial drills, she refers to ones that may mimic the sounds and sights of a shooting.",
            "Guidance from the National Association of School Psychologists and the National Association of School Resource Officers says that schools should give advance warning before shooter drills. Many schools also let children out of drills with parental permission.\u00a0",
            "Talk about it. Ask to see a school counselor or talk with your teacher if you\u2019re feeling uneasy about a drill. Other students might feel the same way. \u201cAt the end of the day, we need our kids to realize you\u2019re not alone,\u201d says Michele Gay. She is co-founder of Safe and Sound Schools. She wants kids to feel they \u201chave the support system of a whole classroom of students and adults.\u201d",
            "Watch for signs. Even if you feel fine right after a drill, it might bother you later. Or, you might feel uneasy without knowing exactly why. Trouble with sleep could be one sign, Brock says. Other symptoms might include being easily startled, constantly worrying or being unable to stop thinking about something. Even not feeling good, or almost sick, could signal a problem, he notes. If you experience any of these things, talk with a school counselor, teacher, parent or other trusted adult.",
            "\u201cIn most cases, people participate in these drills and don\u2019t get more anxious and fearful,\u201d Nickerson says. \u201cBut that could certainly happen. And we want you to know that you\u2019re not alone.\u201d She points out that \u201cit\u2019s a giant strength, not weakness, that you\u2019re able to identify a problem that you need help with.\u201d",
            "Be proactive. Safe and Sound Schools encourages students to form safety clubs at school. Members do service projects to make their schools safer. The clubs also can give students a chance to get involved in conversations about school safety. That can give them a greater sense of security, Gay says.",
            "Or, you may choose to take action in other ways. Aalayah Eastmond survived the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. She\u2019s now studying criminal justice at Trinity Washington University in Washington, D.C. She has testified in both the U.S. House and Senate, urging lawmakers to adopt common-sense laws to curb gun violence.",
            "\u201cIf this is something that you\u2019re passionate about, please get involved,\u201d Aalayah says. Actions can include rallies, marches, lobbying and voter campaigns. \u201cWe cannot let this continue to happen,\u201d she argues. \u201cToo many people are dying every day.\u201d\u00a0"

People have to show a \u201cgenuine need\u201d for a weapon that they want to buy. They must pass a safety test, show good moral character and wait at least 28 days. They also cannot have any restraining orders for violence, among other restrictions, Webster notes.",

And those interactions depend \u201cdepend on the ability of the brain to monitor and control movement.\u201d",

Its overall length spans just over four times the body length of a fruit fly \u2014 about 2 millimeters (0.08 inch). To prevent the critters from flying away, researchers trimmed the flies\u2019 wings. A glass chamber coated with slippery Rain-X surrounded the treadmill. It limited the flies\u2019 ability to wall-walk. When the treadmill was on, the only floor available was a moving one.",
            "On the treadmill, the flies moved as they normally do. Most of the time, they quickly ran to the front of the treadmill. Then they stopped and rode its traveling belt back to the end. As their abdomens then nicked the back of the chamber, the startled flies sprinted forward again.",
            "\u201cThey sprint and then stop, sprint and then stop,\u201d says Brandon Pratt, a neural engineer on the Seattle team.",
            "The flies easily hit speeds of 50 millimeters (just under two inches) per second. That\u2019s the \u201cfastest speed ever reported\u201d for Drosophila moving on the ground, Pratt says. He\u2019s confident the flies can go even faster (though the researchers didn\u2019t thoroughly test this).",

The flies\u2019 middle legs compensated for this odd arrangement, the tests showed. The flies adjust their step distances to keep moving straight ahead. This change in stepping is akin to how a fly might handle a sudden gust of wind from one side. They would turn into the wind by changing the stride on the opposite side.",

            "The treadmill doesn\u2019t allow scientists to record what\u2019s going on in the flies\u2019 brains as they move. That would be a valuable bit of data, Chiappe says. It could show how brain cells spring into action as the flies walk, run or adjust their stride.",
            "Other test systems allow more detailed glimpses into the brain of a moving fly. This includes spheres on which tethered flies can walk. But those systems don\u2019t allow the fly to move as naturally as the Seattle team\u2019s treadmill does.",
            "In addition to producing insights on movement, the treadmill experiments sparked some friendly competition, Pratt says. \u201cThere was a point where we were like, \u2018Can we find the most athletic fly?\u2019 We started going down a rabbit hole,\u201d he says. \u201cWe even did a side project where we did endurance training in flies.

            "The team dipped more yarn in an indican solution, again with no enzyme. Then, they exposed the mix to various light sources. \u201cVery slowly, over the next couple of hours, [the yarn] will turn blue, and more and more blue,\u201d Welner says. \u201cThe light will develop the color.\u201d",
            "Light from the sun, from LEDs and even from household light bulbs can do this.\u00a0In fact, light can dye denim even darker than the enzyme method could using the same amount of indican.",
            "The researchers shared their discovery February 27 in Nature Communications.",
            "Using indican as a dye \u2014 with either an enzyme or light \u2014 would reduce the environmental harm from denim dyeing, the researchers say.",
            "They calculated the impact of each method using factors such as the materials involved, wastes produced and more. They looked at things such as carbon dioxide emissions and worker exposures to toxic chemicals.",
            "The enzyme-based method seems most promising. It could cut the harmful impacts by more than 90 percent, compared to normal denim dyeing, the scientists estimate.",
            "Light-driven dyeing is also less harmful than current methods, though not by quite as much. It might cut the impacts of dyeing denim by more than 70 percent. But the light method might take up less space than the enzyme method \u2014 and use less land. And if the researchers can cut electricity costs by dyeing with just sunlight, not bulbs, the light method may prove even better for the environment.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Using indican instead of indigo may be much better for the environment in some ways, says Robert Vos. He\u2019s a sustainability scientist who did not take part in the new project. Vos works at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But, he notes, the new dyeing methods still use lots of water. And this is a concern because a lot of water also goes into growing the cotton used to make denim.",
            "Both of the new indican-dyeing methods will require more testing before either can be used in factories. But at least cost shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Even with the cost of materials, such as LED lights, the light method may not raise the cost of denim dyeing at all, Qvortrup estimates. The enzyme method should cost only a few cents more per pair of jeans.",
            "That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to develop sustainable jeans [just] for the rich people,\u201d Qvortrup says. \u201cOur aim is to help to make it a cleaner process and not as polluting.\u201d",
            "Welner hopes these methods will have an impact even before they reach factories. Simply learning about more sustainable ways to make jeans may make denim-wearers think about where their clothes come from, she says. \u201cIf you want to wear blue denim,\u201d she says, \u201cbe aware that there are better ways to make it\u201d than are used right now."

            "A never-before-seen type of eruption explosively blasted debris high into the sky from Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano in 2018. It wasn\u2019t one big ka-pow! Kilauea had been erupting lava. Then a series of 12 strange blasts occurred over a span of 11 days. These blasts sent gas, ash and rock eight kilometers (five miles) into the air.",
            "Scientists now liken those blasts to the action of a stomp rocket. That\u2019s a toy propelled from a launch pad as somebody stomps on a pocket of air, suddenly compressing it.",
            "It\u2019s unlike the two well-known processes that trigger most volcanic explosions, notes Joshua Crozier. He\u2019s a geophysicist at Stanford University in California. He also was lead author of the new study.",
            "One standard process is a sudden release of pressure as hot magma moves up pipe-like channels from underground. The magma contains bubbles of gas. As they expand, molten rock will blast out the top of the crater. Most other explosions arise when a rising plume of magma flash-heats groundwater pooled in some of the volcano\u2019s rocks. This will shoot steam and broken bits of rock skyward.",
            "But neither such process seems to explain what happened at Kilauea six years ago.",
            "Instruments near the volcano\u2019s summit collected data as it blew its top again and again between May 16 and May 27, 2018. Those data now suggest the strange sequence of explosions were due to something scientists had never noticed before.",
            "For one thing, the erupted material didn\u2019t contain bubbly bits of magma. That\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from the first process, Crozier says. And rocks in the caldera were already far too hot to contain much liquid water. That eliminates the second scenario.",
            "Instead, it seems large chunks of the crater\u2019s rock fell down into the chamber of magma below. Each drop suddenly compressed air in the magma chamber. This must have sent volcanic debris shooting skyward, Crozier\u2019s team now argues.",
            "They liken this to the way stepping hard on the air bladder of a stomp rocket sends its foam projectile flying.",
            "Crozier\u2019s team described this novel volcanic action May 27 in Nature Geoscience.",
            "A falling of the \u201croof rock\u201d at the volcano\u2019s summit appears to have smooshed magma in the chamber below. Such a collapse of the crater\u2019s rock is known as subsidence. And this collapse didn\u2019t happen all at once. There were a series of successive drops. Each likely triggered another explosive burst.",
            "Almost as soon as the eruptions began, Crozier and others began suspecting these bursts traced to those collapses in the volcano\u2019s caldera. To confirm their hunch, the team pored over abundant data that has been continuously collected at the site.",
            "Kilauea is one of the most extensively instrumented volcanoes in the world. Networks of seismometers keep close watch on Kilauea\u2019s inner workings. Meanwhile, GPS-armed tiltmeters near its summit record subtle changes in the movement and slope of the ground. This tracks how magma moving below strains the rock.",

This was several weeks after the stomp rocket\u2013style eruptions had ended. Red circles mark the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, or HVO, and the Volcano House hotel.",
            "The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory also has a network of microphones that pick up frequencies below what the human ear can hear. These infrasound rumblings pointed to changes in air pressure. Some were likely caused by explosions.",
            "Changes in the frequency of infrasound waves moving through the ground revealed a distinct pattern during May 2018. They suggest the chamber would enlarge, after which there would be an explosion. Seismic waves, meanwhile, showed a series of distinct earthquakes. Each was less than a magnitude 5 in intensity. These, too, were linked to the explosions.",
            "What likely happened, the researchers say, is that the magma chamber drained enough to make its rocky roof unstable. This let that ceiling rock fall under its own weight. The falling rock suddenly compressed air above the magma \u2014 like compressing a stomp rocket\u2019s air bladder. Some 10 to 30 seconds later, cameras observed the summit shooting hot gas and rock up and out of the magma chamber.",
            "\u201cThis is the first time, to my knowledge, that such a mechanism has been suggested to drive eruptions,\u201d says Larry Mastin. He works at the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.",
            "Mastin did not take part in the new analyses. But as a volcanologist, he understands what can go on in and around magma chambers. What\u2019s being reported is \u201ca rather unusual mechanism,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut the circumstances of this eruption are unusual.\u201d And unusually good monitoring proved \u201cvery useful in helping narrow down the cause.\u201d",
            "The stomp-rocket mechanism only affected the very early stages of Kilauea\u2019s summit collapse, Mastin says. That was basically when \u201cthe roof [was] falling in right above the magma.\u201d Over time, as the collapse in the caldera floor\u2019s radiated outward, the tightly focused stomp-rocket compression ended. And that largely stopped the eruptions as debris clogged the vent in the central caldera.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Stomp-rocket-style eruptions probably aren\u2019t unique to Kilauea, Crozier says. The volcano\u2019s extensive monitoring just made it especially easy to detect the new phenomenon, he says. Knowing how to link seismic and infrasound data may one day help mitigate hazards elsewhere, he says \u2014 at volcanoes with far less instrumentation.",
            "\u201cIn many cases, the first sign we have of an eruption is a seismic or infrasound signal,\u201d Crozier says. The better that science gets at relating such data to what the erupting plume is doing, he says, \u201cthe better we can calibrate our models.\u201d And that, he says, could help warn of upcoming explosive risks."

It swirled for hours above Earth\u2019s northernmost magnetic site, or pole. Now, research has turned up parallel space hurricanes swirling high above the south magnetic pole.",
            "Scientists spotted the first space hurricane in 2021. It was a cyclone-shaped aurora \u2014 a type of northern light show. Unlike sea-level hurricanes, however, this one rained electrons, not water.",
            "Space physicist Sheng Lu at Shandong University in Weihai, China was part of a team that wanted to know if this type of special aurora was just a northern event. To find out, the group pored over satellite data on the southern hemisphere\u2019s ionosphere.",
            "Between 2005 and 2016 they turned up 259 space hurricanes. That\u2019s about 23 per year, on average. It\u2019s also close to the rate that had been estimated to develop in the northern ionosphere.",
            "The team identified other parallels, too. For instance, space hurricanes tend to emerge over the poles in each region\u2019s summer months.",
            "Lu\u2019s team shared its findings June 25 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.",
            "A barrage of charged particles rains down on Earth from the sun. This solar wind can split our planet\u2019s magnetic-field lines\u00ad. Later, the lines will reconnect. As they do, they churn up ionized gas \u2014 or plasma \u2014 in the ionosphere. This can drive flows of electric current upward, Lu\u2019s team suggests. Those flows then bend and begin to spin. That creates a cyclonic \u201ceye\u201d at the center.",
            "So those shifts in Earth\u2019s magnetic field are what likely set off a space hurricane, the researchers now argue. This, they propose, would be similar to the rise of warm, humid air at the center of the tropical cyclones that spin across Earth\u2019s oceans."

            "Waterpower may have given a big lift to the builders of Egypt\u2019s first pyramid.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "It was built for King Djoser, the first ruler of Egypt\u2019s Third Dynasty. That was nearly 4,700 years ago. The structure\u2019s stone platforms get smaller as they rise from the ground. The six levels stand roughly 62 meters (200 feet) tall in the Saqqara necropolis. That\u2019s a vast ancient burial ground in northern Egypt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Researchers now suggest that ancient people used a water-powered system to construct this pyramid. How? Builders would have controlled flows of water into and out of a large shaft inside the pyramid. The water\u2019s movement would have lifted and lowered a platform that carried building stones to higher levels.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists shared this idea August 5 in\u00a0PLOS ONE. The team was led by Xavier Landreau. He has a background in materials science and physics. He also founded a private research institute known as the Paleotechnic to study ancient technologies. It\u2019s in Paris, France.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "There\u2019s no broadly accepted explanation for how people built pyramids in ancient Egypt. It took millions of massive blocks. Some of those blocks weighed up to 2,500 kilograms (5,500 pounds).\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scholars have proposed several techniques \u2014 including ramps and cranes \u2014 to move such hefty stone blocks. Scientists have also thought about rope-and-pulley devices and\u202frolling wooden rods attached to stones.\u00a0",
            "Other studies have hinted that water played some role in building pyramids. ",
            "Earlier this year, researchers reported a newfound Nile tributary.\u202f(A tributary is a freshwater stream that feeds into a larger river.) This stream borders a chain of 31 pyramids, including Djoser\u2019s. It\u2019s dried up now. But boats carrying workers and building blocks could have traveled this branch of the Nile between 3,700 and 4,700 years ago. They might have docked near to sites where the pyramids now stand.\u00a0",
            "But water likely played an even bigger part in building Egypt\u2019s first pyramid, Landreau says. Designers of Djoser\u2019s pyramid devised techniques for controlling water flow, he now argues. This field of knowledge is known as hydraulics.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The proposed hydraulic system is based on a computer model. That model included data on features inside the pyramid and on a network of underground tunnels at the site. The team also added detailed satellite images of the region. These all helped to model ancient rainfall and runoff levels.\u00a0",
            "In addition to the pyramid itself, the model also included a walled enclosure several hundred meters (yards) away. Known as Gisr el-Mudir, this structure was first described in the 1700s. But its exact purpose has long been a puzzle.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In the new model, Gisr el-Mudir would have captured floodwater that flowed through desert channels during heavy rains. Structures in the walls of the enclosure fed the water to a basin just west of Djoser\u2019s burial grounds. Periods of intense rain may have temporarily turned that basin into a lake. Such a lake would have then drained into a section of a limestone trench around the burial complex. That trench is now known as the Dry Moat.\u00a0",
            "Water from the Dry Moat could have entered two large shafts. One was a north shaft inside the pyramid. Granite chambers near the bottom of both shafts contained stone plugs. When removed, water could rush in.\u00a0",
            "Landreau\u2019s group thinks the north shaft is the framework for a water-powered lift. They think a huge wooden float rested above its granite chamber. That float would have been attached to long ropes. These ropes could have passed over pulleys at the top of the shaft before looping around to attach to a lift platform. ",
            "Ancient engineers would have designed the float and lift platform to counterbalance each other as water filled or drained from the shaft.\u00a0",

            "fCThe controversial new study suggests that a stone-walled dam (far left) fed flood water to a deep trench (center). That water was then sent to a shaft inside the first ancient Egyptian pyramid (far right). The shaft may have served as an elevator to lift stones during the pyramid\u2019s construction.",
            "Workers hauling building stones could have gotten onto the lift platform at ground level. Or they might have gotten on through a tunnel several meters above ground level.\u00a0",
            "As water filled the shaft through the granite chamber, the float would rise and the platform descend. Water would be shut off when the platform reached the loading area. After placing tons of stones on the platform, the shaft would be drained. Then, as the float descended, it pulled on the ropes. And that yanked the platform and its cargo up to new construction levels.\u00a0",
            "Researchers not involved with the study find the water power idea intriguing. But they are not convinced that pyramid builders ever used it.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "One skeptic is Oren Siegel. He\u2019s an archaeologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. Gisr el-Mudir could not have held enough water from occasional rains to maintain this hydraulic system, he argues. Instead, Siegel thinks Gisr el-Mudir may have been an early experiment. It could have been used to test the building of stone enclosures like those that would later, on a larger scale, surround pharaohs\u2019 burial sites.\u00a0",
            "Kamil Kuraszkiewicz has doubts about something else: the proposed lake. It\u2019s not mentioned in any ancient Egyptian writings. He suspects it may never have existed. Kuraszkiewicz is an Egyptologist in Poland at the University of Warsaw.\u00a0",
            "Djoser\u2019s pyramid stones also each weighed, on average, some 300 kilograms (660 pounds). That may sound heavy. But these blocks were much smaller and easier for workers to move than the ones used for later pyramids, says Kuraszkiewicz. Building the proposed water-powered system, he says, would have required \u201cmuch more effort \u2026 than to move the stone blocks using just manpower.\u201d\u00a0"

They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",
            "The researchers described the finding March 12 in Scientific Reports.",
            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely.

The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",

It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",

One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae.

The other treatment groups fared better. Eight in 10 of those treated with both medications lived. And in the celastrol group, nine in every 10 survived.",
            "All survivors were given one last chance to climb up to a treat. The untreated flies took an average of 112 seconds to reach the treat. The celastrol group needed about 71 seconds. The naproxen group took about 54 seconds and flies given both celastrol and naproxen made the climb in 55 seconds. Those last speeds were similar to how they had performed before their TBIs.",

            "Scientists snooped on the brain activity of college students who wrote by hand or typed words. Compared with when they typed, more of the students\u2019 brain regions worked together when students scribbled with a pen. This trend also showed up in brainwaves \u2014 patterns of electrical activity \u2014 that have been linked with forming memories. That might mean writing notes by hand could boost memory of the material for a test, for instance.",
            "Previous research had shown that handwriting improves spelling and the ability to remember what you\u2019ve learned. Handwriting also strengthens the understanding of concepts. Scientists think that the slow process of tracing out letters and words gives people more time to process material and learn it.",

            "Audrey van der Meer and Ruud van der Weel are psychologists. They study the human mind at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. The pair recruited college students for their new study. They showed students a word on a computer screen, then asked them to type or handwrite it in cursive with a digital pen. All the while, sensors in caps they wore recorded electrical activity in their brains.",

The team was looking for different brain regions whose waves were in sync. When those waves have the same frequency at the same time, it hints at how strongly the areas are linked while working on some task.\u00a0",

That\u2019s because certain brainwaves that get a boost play a role in making and storing memories.",

A psychologist, she works at Radford University in Virginia. More study is needed on the differences in brain linkages and whether they align with how well people learn.",

            "Handwriting may aid learning. But typing is often easier, faster and more practical. So students and teachers alike should decide, based on the task, whether to write it out or type, van der Meer says. For example, using handwriting to take notes might help you hang on to information, while typing an essay could help you get ideas down to the page faster, before you forget them.",

            "In late July, the union\u2019s African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights ruled, after nine years of deliberation, that the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) should hand back parts of the giant Kahuzi-Biega National Park in the forested east of the country to its ancestral owners, the Batwa people. \n",
            "Such a restitution would right a terrible injustice, executed in the name of conservation. In the 1970s, after the park was established, the government expelled some 6,000 Batwa without consultation from the highland region of the park and revoked their customary land rights. The exiles were left landless and without compensation. To this day, many live in roadside squatter camps, often secretly entering the park to collect firewood, hunt for food, and practice rituals. \n",
            "\u201cThis is an incredibly important ruling, which will impact the thinking and discourse on conservation and land rights across Africa,\u201d says Deborah Rogers, a former ecologist with the Nature Conservancy who has a long-standing interest in the park and is now president of the Initiative for Equality, a network of activist organizations. \u201cIt will set a legal precedent among member states of the African Union.\u201d",

But it declined to answer questions from Yale Environment 360 about whether it supports the ruling or will help to implement it.",
            "But a Batwa elder now based in Bukavu near the park, who answered on condition of anonymity, explained why the ruling was so important to the tribe. \u201cOur traditional lands in the park are numerous, because each clan has its own hills. Among these hills, there are sacred sites where we communicated with the ancestors and communed with the forest, which we consider to be the nourishing mother. These lands our are identity.

And it calls on the government to adopt into law as soon as possible \u201can effective mechanism for the delimitation, demarcation and titling of the territory traditionally occupied by the Batwa and the various natural resources attached to it in accordance with their tradition,\u201d and to annul all laws \u201cprohibiting the presence of the Batwa on ancestral lands and the enjoyment of the fruits of these lands.\u201d",

According to an attorney based in Bukavu, who is part-Batwa and has been following the case closely, the government has all along attempted to thwart the commission\u2019s investigation. \u201cIt has never responded to correspondence addressed to it by the Commission, nor appeared before it, even though it is a signatory member of the African Charter.\u201d (Neither the commission nor the DRC government has responded to requests for comment.)",

",
            "The forced eviction of Indigenous people, such as the Batwa, from their ancestral lands across Africa has been widespread for decades.

The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization\u2019s work in the region.",
            "The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians \u2014 more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them.",
            "The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month \u2014 signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists \u2014 contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not \u201cdetract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d noting \u201ctheir lands include more than a third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes.\u201d",

            "Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas. UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site and calls it \u201cone of the ecologically richest regions of Africa.\u201d",
            "But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

            "Many armed groups stayed on after the civil wars, setting up crude mining operations for coltan (used in cellphones and personal computers), cassiterite (tin ore), and gold. Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",
            "BQ\u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that \u201cpark guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.\u201d",
            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas. The result, he says, is \u201cthousands of hectares of deforestation,\u201d visible in satellite images.",

            "Simpson accuses human rights lobbyists of having an \u201coverly idealized image of the Batwa as ecologically noble savages.\u201d Even so, he says the Batwa are minor players in a wider economy of ecological destruction. The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides \u201cideal hideouts\u201d for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is \u201cthe only feasible form of enforcement.\u201d",
            "But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",
            "\u201cDoes the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

The vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 490,000 school buses \u2014 which comprise the nation\u2019s largest public-transportation fleet \u2014 are powered by diesel engines. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning our kids on the way to school,\u201d said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children\u2019s lungs.",
            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",

            "fCChildren aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February.\nTom Brenner / AP Photo.",
            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19371586/embed",
            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

            "In 2020, the Dome Fire swept through Southern California\u2019s Mojave National Preserve, blackening nearly 70 square miles of highly biodiverse desert. The conflagration killed 1.3 million Joshua trees, including most of those on Cima Dome, one of the largest and densest Joshua tree woodlands in the world.\n",
            "Then in 2023, the York Fire swept through and burned a large section of adjacent Joshua tree forest, killing another million or so trees. The destruction on Cima Dome \u2014 which is higher in elevation and cooler than the surrounding desert \u2014 came as an especially severe blow to the National Park Service and conservationists who had considered it a stronghold for the eastern Joshua tree and a key to the species\u2019 future.\n",
            "Experts were planning to make Cima Dome a refuge by clearing out invasive grasses and monitoring the woodland\u2019s health, said Andrew Kaiser, a botanist who worked at the Mojave National Preserve during the fires and now works for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, developing its Western Joshua Tree Conservation Plan. \u201cThe perimeter of the 2020 Dome fire was essentially the exact outline of the model climate refugia. It almost completely overlapped it.\u201d",
            "BQStudies found that if warming temperatures aren\u2019t mitigated, nearly 100 percent of the trees could be lost in the coming decades.",
            "The number of wildfires that kill and damage Joshua trees has increased sharply in recent years \u201cin significant part due to changes in the desert ecosystem,\u201d said Brendan Cummings, the conservation director of the Center for Biological Diversity, who lives in the town of Joshua Tree and is a leader in the fight to legally protect the trees. \u201cThirty years ago, a typical fire in a Joshua tree woodland would burn less than an acre. Lightning would hit a tree and it would fall. Rarely would it burn beyond an acre.\u201d Now, he said, larger fires are prevalent.",
            "Such blazes are one of the major threats to Joshua trees: Hotter and drier weather, which kills seedlings and reduces recruitment of new trees, is another important factor. Studies from 2019 and 2011 found that if warming temperatures aren\u2019t mitigated, nearly 100 percent of the trees across their range, which extends across parts of the southwestern United States, could be lost in the coming decades. That\u2019s if development, especially of utility-scale solar farms, doesn\u2019t wipe them out first.",

The Spanish called them izote de desierto, the desert dagger, and the local Cahuilla tribe calls them humwichawa. Mormon settlers are said to have named the tree after the prophet Joshua, who kept his hands raised and spread to guide the Israelites. Mature trees range from 75 years old to more than 300, and seedlings take about 30 years to reach maturity.\n",

Each depends on a single species of moth for pollination \u2014 a moth that doesn\u2019t pollinate the other species.",
            "They are also critical to desert biodiversity. \u201cThey are keystone species, which means they create more habitat for other species and increase the biodiversity of the overall desert,\u201d said Cameron Barrows, a retired University of California, Riverside, research ecologist who studies Joshua trees. \u201cEverything from red-tailed hawks to great horned owls to Scott\u2019s orioles and cactus wrens \u2014 their density and abundance is tied to the availability of nesting sites, and Joshua trees are really the only nesting sites in much of the Mojave Desert.\u201d\n",

            "Climate change is a major contributor to shifts in the Mojave\u2019s fire regime. The vast increase in acres burned is in part due to hotter temperatures, which increase the growth rate of invasive grasses. The desert\u2019s average temperature has gone up as much as 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees C) in the last hundred years, and rainfall has declined by up to 20 percent in some areas. Precipitation in the Mojave, the most arid place in North America, varies widely but averages 5 inches a year. Joshua trees are highly adapted to the searing heat of the Mojave, flourishing in temperatures of more than 120 degrees F (49 degrees C). But they need moisture, too, and climate change has brought drought.",

And while a couple of recent wet winters have helped new Joshua seedlings to sprout, their survival isn\u2019t assured: Joshua trees need a dependable supply of moisture to make it through their early years.",
            " \u201cThe temperature is important, but rainfall is really important,\u201d said Barrows. \u201cIf you couple higher temperatures and drier conditions, you are screwed.\u201d\n",
            "At the same time, wet years also help plant species that threaten the Joshua tree. \u201cOver the last few decades, the invasive grasses originally brought here by cattle ranching and other sources have taken over the Mojave, [changing] the fire regime,\u201d said Cummings. Grasses such as red brome and Mediterranean split grass are highly flammable, and in wet years they grow in profusion and create more intense and far more widespread fires.",
            "There is also concern that the invasion of exotic species, in combination with climate change and the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen \u2014 which wafts in from the smoggy Los Angeles basin and stimulates the growth of flammable grasses \u2014 will keep the post-fire Joshua woodlands from reestablishing themselves. Instead, those areas could convert to a non-native grassland with low biodiversity.",
            "BQIronically, one of the biggest threats to trees are large-scale solar arrays that are being built to help wean California off fossil fuels.",
            "The western Joshua tree has been proposed for threatened status under the California Endangered Species Act and has been regulated, since 2023, by the state\u2019s Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act, which forbids cutting trees from either private or public land without authorization from the state. The federal government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, rejected federal endangered species protection for both subspecies, most recently in 2023.",
            "One reason for the lack of protection is that there is currently no shortage of Joshua trees \u2014 the threat is based on projections of future loss. The population of eastern Joshua trees is estimated to be several million, and the western population contains as many as 10 million trees. Nonetheless, Cummings argues that they are both deserving of protection because the forecasts of the future look bleak. \u201cWe know they are on an extinction trajectory, given the threat of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf climate change is frozen at current levels, we [still] lose half their range.\u201d Temperatures, of course, are not expected to remain steady.",
            "Another potential threat to the western species is development in the Mojave Desert, where half of the trees occur on private land. (The vast majority of eastern Joshua trees grow on public land.) Ironically, one of the biggest threats to trees are large-scale solar arrays that are being built to help wean the state off fossil fuels. The 530-megawatt Aratina solar-plus-storage project, to be built on private land near Boron, California, would kill nearly 4,000 Joshua trees and reduce habitat for desert tortoises and other species.",

The California desert, along with the North African desert, has the highest solar radiance in the world, they argue, which makes it prime for generating electricity. \u201cOur grid capacity needs to be expanded by numbers that are almost unimaginable,\u201d Shannon Eddy, executive director of the Large-Scale Solar Association, told Vice News. \u201cWe\u2019re just at the very leading edge of figuring this out. So to take huge swaths of the desert and set them off limits to solar development now, before we really know where they need to go, isn\u2019t appropriate.\u201d",
            "The Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act, which grandfathered in some solar projects, came about when the California Department of Fish and Wildlife deadlocked on whether to list the subspecies as threatened. A political compromise, the act passed because it offered more management flexibility than listing the tree.",

            "One key part of the emerging conservation strategy, which is guided in part by a recent paper published in the journal Biological Conservation, is to protect the trees in refugia, designated areas where the Joshua tree forest is healthy and that might be cooler and less susceptible to drought as temperatures increase. In Joshua Tree National Park, managers are clearing grasses in refugia, for example, to remove fuel and create fire breaks between trees.",
            "Researchers are also mapping the trees\u2019 genomes to predict which populations are most resilient to heat and drought so their preservation can be prioritized or their seeds used for replanting.\n",
            "Assisted migration \u2014 physically moving adult trees to Northern California and Oregon \u2014 has been considered. But \u201cyou can\u2019t just move the Joshua tree,\u201d Kaiser, from California\u2019s Department of Fish and Wildlife, said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to move the nurse plants [which help seedlings get established]. You\u2019ve got to move the yucca moth pollinator. You\u2019ve got to monitor. All of the research we\u2019ve seen so far suggests it\u2019s not a viable option at this moment in time. But we\u2019re not ruling it out.\u201d\n",
            "In spite of all these threats, there are glimmers of hope. Increased use of electric vehicles in Southern California, for example, could reduce levels of the atmospheric nitrogen that fuels the growth of flammable grasses.",
            "And there is widespread commitment by concerned partners. \u201cIn areas that are well managed, like a national park, I am optimistic,\u201d said Barrows, of UC Riverside. \u201cInterestingly, there are some areas where trees are actually invading up into the pine forest and doing really well because it is higher, cooler, and wetter. So Joshua trees as a species are not going to go extinct, but areas of the Mojave Desert will become more ecologically depauperate if they lose the Joshua tree \u2014 unless we can reverse the climate change issue.\u201d "

He figured he could get it up and running by 2005. Nearly 20 years later, Wikelski may have finally succeeded \u2014 after surmounting roadblocks that range from bureaucratic mishaps to technical glitches to a geopolitical crisis. His space-based system, known as ICARUS (International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space), is now scheduled to launch, in its latest, satellite-based incarnation, on a private rocket sometime in 2025.\n",
            "The underlying idea of the internet of animals is to tune into the planet\u2019s hidden phenomena \u2014 the flight paths followed by sharp-shinned hawks, the precise fates befalling Arctic terns that die young, the exact landscape requirements of critically endangered saiga antelope \u2014 by attaching tiny, solar-powered tracking devices, some weighing less than a paperclip, to all kinds of organisms and even some inanimate objects (glaciers, ocean plastic debris). The inexpensive, globe-spanning system of animal tagging is meant to help scientists understand the precise drivers of global change, and much more, by tracking thousands of tagged animals from space and tying their experiences to the broader impacts facing whole populations or even species.",

But last-minute political haggling siphoned more than a third of the project\u2019s German funding, leaving no money to include ICARUS. \u201cWe were totally devastated,\u201d Wikelski recalled. He gave his project three months to find a solution or finally give up. \u201cThat\u2019s when we scaled down and said, we need a CubeSat.\u201d",

The plovers often occupy private ranchlands, which makes them hard to find without trespassing. And they breed in late March and April, while bird surveys, timed to count migratory songbirds, happen in May.\n",

He also wants to learn what drives the birds to migrate. \u201cAre they moving away from something or toward something else?\u201d he asks. He also hopes to determine exactly where the birds are running into trouble.",
            "Before the ISS receiver went dark in 2022, the ICARUS tags revealed that the plovers didn\u2019t follow fixed migration routes and that birds from around the country were mingling in the winter. When several transmitting birds died, Wunder was able to dispatch researchers to their locations and discover the cause of death \u2014 predation. The birds started returning to Colorado in February, and Wunder was eager to see which ones would come back \u2014 but then the war in Ukraine began. \u201cWe were cut off, there was no more information,\u201d he said.\n",

It\u2019s a way to level the playing field, she says, so that \u201cfolks that have a smaller budget or are working on species that are a bit more obscure and there\u2019s not as much funding behind can start to get the same kind of information, baseline info, about where those [animals] are going.\u201d\n",

A single e-obs tag costs more than $1,500 and works over a cellular network, meaning researchers must also pay the cost of data transmission for as long as the animal lives. \u201cIf you want to get a good sample size that will allow you to publish your research, that adds up really quickly,\u201d Aikens said. \u201cICARUS tags are cheaper by an order of magnitude.\u201d",

            "ICARUS tags are solar-powered, whereas some existing tagging systems run on batteries, which can die \u2014 ending the research on that individual or requiring recapture to change them out. Other tagging systems rely on animals passing by a signal tower. It works for certain animals, like birds and bats, but not for others. \u201cBecause ICARUS is satellite-powered, you don\u2019t have to wait for your animal to go back on the grid and pass by a tower,\u201d said Lohr.

That\u2019s a place that ICARUS can help fill in a lot of gaps.\u201d\n",
            "And if the internet of animals can zero in on specific issues \u2014 for instance, a bird species dying out because a particular insect it eats is being killed by a particular chemical being sprayed in an area \u2014 Wikelski believes such information could drive people to act. \u201cPeople are willing to do something about it if they know that what they do is really helpful,\u201d he said.\n",
            "For now, Wikelski continues to practice patience. When I spoke to him in early July, he was dealing with the latest hurdle: satellite launch delays, including one caused by a payload issue and another caused by an ill-timed summer holiday that delayed authorization of the $30,000 payment needed to secure a launch reservation. \u201cOur project is now too small to really be on everybody\u2019s horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, it was too large.\u201d",
            "Nevertheless, Wikelski was hopeful. His team was studying and perfecting the lowest-stress methods of tagging animals and even testing automatic tagging systems, like one for deer involving a salt lick and a tiny elastic band. He remained confident of ICARUS\u2019s potential.",
            "\u201cOne really important aspect we think is transformative in biology is the scaling up of tagging,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have one animal but 50 or 100, or you do it across a continent.\u201d Over the next two years he plans to tag 9,000 animals in Europe, including blackbirds, storm thrushes, swifts, and sparrows in a study already underway. Roughly 7,000 of those 9,000 would die in the first year, he said, based on general patterns. \u201cThat means we are finally understanding where they disappear. Where are the death traps? These tags are so smart, they can tell us if a female is nesting and if the clutch disappears. So we can not only get information on where the adults are living and dying, but have the adults been successful in hatching or clutching? Is there a massive problem in a certain area? Then we can link individuals to populations and understand the drivers of change.\u201d"

A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geoengineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change.",
            "Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral \u2014 eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",

They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can\u2019t wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t mitigate our way out of this,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe need other tools.\u201d\n",
            "Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls.\n",

Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",
            "BQSome experts are confident that giant undersea curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean.",
            "Moore wants to get started on testing the idea, and he and his collaborators are seeking research funding. The first experiments in a large lab tank are expected to begin within a few weeks at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Climate Repair, whose mission is to advance \u201cclimate repair projects that can be rolled out at scale within the next 5-10 years.\u201d",
            "Real-world experiments could follow quickly, says Moore. \u201cWithin two years, we could be working at a fjord in northern Norway, testing different designs in a marine setting.\u201d He has identified a target fjord but won\u2019t say where. \u201cIf that goes well, we would want to scale up to a curtain as much as a kilometer across.\u201d He envisions this being tested among the glaciers of Svalbard, the Norwegian Arctic archipelago that has become an international center for polar research. \u201cIn 10-15 years, we should have something to deploy in Antarctica,\u201d he says.",
            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.

The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",
            "Moore calls the bubble barrier a \u201cwild card.\u201d But, he says, \u201cit is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.\u201d Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched.",
            "BQAn Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides.",
            "There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "In an ideal world, Scambos says, \u201cwe could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.\u201d But the world isn\u2019t like that.

We need a social licence.\u201d He agrees that there are other important causes of current and future sea-level rise. But \u201cnone of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.\u201d",

When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",

I saw few signs of human life on the wild Nahanni and the muddy Liard. But once I got to the Mackenzie, which is part of the second longest river system on the continent, I had to make way for tugboats pulling giant barges filled with gas, heating fuel, dry food, and other supplies destined for roadless Indigenous communities downstream of the village of Wrigley, where the Mackenzie Highway, which begins in Alberta, ends. More than once on a cold misty night, I was awoken in my tent by the deafening blast of a tug\u2019s horn.",
            "Nowadays, those horn blasts are far less frequent because the Mackenzie River, which flows northwest to the Arctic Ocean and is part of the second longest river system on the continent, is at times not deep enough to float those barges. In fact, the government-owned company that operates the tugs stopped service altogether this year when it became clear the river would not contain sufficient water \u2014 even in late spring, after river ice melted. In June, the Canadian Coast Guard announced its services, including the provision of on-the-water responses and maintenance of aids to navigation, were \u201cimpacted\u201d for almost a thousand miles of river.\n",

Many are currently rationing fuel and bringing in food from the south while vacationing or undergoing medical exams and treatment.\n",

The Great Slave Lake, the fifth largest lake in North America, which drains into the Mackenzie River, is also at a record low.",

High water levels, the result of melting far earlier in the year, are also causing disruptions.

The road was estimated to cost at least $700 million, and in 2018 the government allocated approximately $70 million to study its feasibility. But last February, Canada\u2019s Environment Minister announced the government would no longer invest in major, new road construction. Money spent on asphalt and concrete, minister Steven Guilbeault said, would be \u201cbetter invested into projects that will help fight climate change and adapt to its impacts.\u201d",
            "After a public outcry, Northwest Territory\u2019s member of parliament, Michael McLeod, quickly clarified that the Mackenzie Valley Highway was still on the table, as did Guilbeault.",
            "Still, conservationists worry that saying yes to the road will bolster the claims of other communities and mining interests that have been lobbying for roads in other regions of the Arctic. For example, mining companies and the Inuit in the Kitikmeot region of the central Arctic have pushed \u2014 unsuccessfully so far \u2014 for a port to be constructed along the Arctic coast with a road running from Bathurst Inlet to a complex of inland mines and mining exploration sites.",
            "Earlier this year, Nunavut, Canada\u2019s self-governing Inuit territory, hired an engineering company to study the potential for a 450-mile road that would connect four western Hudson Bay communities. A separate 200-mile route to the more remote inland community of Baker Lake is also under consideration. Neither of these roads, nor the Mackenzie Valley Highway, could be built without significant federal funding.",
            "To understand why the federal government may be reluctant to fund Arctic roads, it\u2019s helpful to understand the fate of other northern highways and what a rapidly warming Arctic will mean for such infrastructure.",

But few tourists undertake the long, punishing drive, and the oil and gas companies pulled out of the region before the road was even completed. Today, Tuktoyaktuk is slowly sliding into the sea due to rising sea levels, powerful storms surges, and rapidly thawing permafrost.",
            "Maintaining Arctic roads has also proved costly. Just a few years after the Inuvik to Tuk highway was completed, the government spent an additional $13.5 million to raise it in areas where permafrost had thawed. Climate-related maintenance costs for the Yukon\u2019s highway network have risen by $169,000 per year, in constant 2021 dollars, since 1994.\n",

First, the right-of-way for the Mackenzie road does not pass through critical wildlife corridors, as the Bathurst Inlet road would. Second, they don\u2019t want to jeopardize their relationship with people of the western Arctic, as there is still much wilderness to protect there, and they need the Dene on their side as partners, as the Dene own and have rights to vast areas of land.\n",
            "The people of the Sahtu have already invested more in conservation and carbon capture than has any jurisdiction in the south.

            "The Sahtu hope that the road will make it easier and cheaper to receive essential goods. But they also foresee economic opportunity, hoping that tourists, climbers, hikers, and paddlers travel to the new park and the region\u2019s pristine mountain and tundra rivers.",
            "Road proponents like McCauley point to other reasons for building. A road would make it easier to clean up the piles of scrap metals, broken down vehicles, leaking batteries, and other toxic materials from mining and other development activity that have been accumulating in Indigenous communities along the Mackenzie, and in Inuit communities on the Arctic islands, for decades.",

The two pilots were not seated front and center; instead, they steered the plane in a capsule attached far out on the right wing. The plane had some other unusual features. On the far-left wing, another slender capsule contained a tank of so-called cryogenic hydrogen, cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius, or minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. A fuel cell inside the plane caused the liquid hydrogen to react with oxygen, producing water and enough electricity to power an electric motor with the propeller attached. The plane flew not with fossil fuel, but with hydrogen.",

While most SAFs are currently derived mainly from animal and industrial waste, IATA has called for algae, waste biomass from forestry, agriculture, and municipal waste to be added to the feedstock of refineries as fast as possible. With such a diverse feedstock, however, achieving and proving carbon-neutrality will be difficult. Any kind of biomass feedstock will generate CO2 emissions, for example when energy-intensive fertilizer or diesel tractors and trucks are used in industrial agriculture.",

They examined how to reduce contrails and nitrous oxide emissions most efficiently, and they came up with futuristic new plane designs, including one with a staggering 10 electric engines and propellers.",
            "BQSustainable fuel might not be available in large enough quantities, and harvesting it could harm vulnerable ecosystems.",
            "The studies underscored the challenges of using hydrogen as aviation fuel. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you can\u2019t just put a hydrogen tank in an airplane and fly off,\u201d Nagel says. New materials are needed to build the planes because tiny hydrogen atoms easily leak and tend to make anything they touch brittle. Nagel acknowledges that deep changes to aircraft architecture are necessary. Computer-simulated hydrogen planes developed in the EXACT study don\u2019t have their fuel tanks spread out in the wings, as current planes do. Instead, they are designed to be nearly spherical, to reduce their surface area and the weight of the insulation needed to keep hydrogen fuel in its cryogenic state.

For SAF, a considerable reduction could be shown compared to fossil jet fuel, since due to their higher chemical purity, SAFs emit much less of the soot that causes contrails.\n",

In terms of cost, liquid hydrogen fuel will require higher initial investments, Nagel says, but it should come out on par or cheaper than SAFs when their biomass demand, and the high cost of direct air capture of carbon, are figured in. When critics point out that hydrogen requires four times the volume per unit of energy as kerosene, Nagel answers that it weighs three times less. \u201cAccording to our calculations, this largely cancels each other out,\u201d he says.\n",
            "Nagel admits that many challenges remain. \u201cThe devil is in the details\u201d is a phrase he often uses. Overall, he has concluded that hydrogen, if made with electricity from renewable sources, has enough advantages to become the fuel of the future, with SAF and \u201celectro-SAF\u201d filling in for some time to come and for certain demands.",

            "Nagel is convinced that hydrogen\u2019s technological challenges can be resolved. With that goal, his institute is turning a ground-based A320 jet into a \u201cHydrogen Aviation Lab\u201d at Hamburg airport to test components and create a filling station for hydrogen fuel made by the region\u2019s wind farms, in a project run by Lufthansa Technik. The German Aerospace Center is also involved in turning a Dornier 328 into a flying test bed for hydrogen-electric propulsion, and it is testing direct hydrogen combustion engines in Cologne.",
            "But like all big players, the research agency is hedging its bets on aviation\u2019s future. It is also researching Power to Liquid technologies, for which a pilot plant will be built in Eastern Germany. And in the U.S., Boeing is pursuing research on hydrogen propulsion. \u201cWe know it will take an \u2018SAF and\u2019 approach and not an \u2018SAF or\u2019 approach to achieving net-zero by 2050,\u201d Boeing\u2019s Raymond concedes.",
            "Given Boeing\u2019s current massive quality problems with its existing fleet, it is safe to say that hydrogen propulsion will either be developed in Europe, or nowhere. \u201cWe\u2019d like to work with all aircraft manufacturers on hydrogen but it is clear that Boeing has a different focus right now,\u201d Nagel says. In contrast, Airbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen plane fit to transport passengers to the market by 2035. At the Dubai air show last December, Airbus\u2019 chief sustainability officer, Julie Kitcher, radiated optimism when she said that hydrogen propulsion is moving towards \u201ctechnological readiness.\u201d In January, the company opened a brand-new R&D center for hydrogen technologies in Stade, some 40 kilometers north of Hamburg down the Elbe River."

Last April, the Texas-based company 1PointFive broke ground on a direct air capture facility called Stratos that, by 2025, aims to absorb 500,000 metric tons of atmospheric CO2 each year. That\u2019s 125 times more CO2 than the next-largest direct air capture plant.\n",
            "The concept of direct air capture has been around for decades. In the face of skyrocketing global temperatures and CO2 levels, the idea is simple: remove some of that CO2 from the air and either bury it underground or turn it into a saleable product. After years of lab tests and experiments, these efforts  started to gain commercial traction a few years ago. Now, direct air capture is seriously ramping up, with about 20 plants in operation across Europe, Canada, and the U.S., where the Department of Energy is funding four regional direct air capture hubs. Globally, more than 100 plants are at some stage of development.\n",
            "Though the concept is simple, there are still plenty of hurdles. Building and operating an air capture plant is about 50 times more expensive than planting trees per ton of CO2 taken up. Researchers are working hard to come up with new materials and systems to lower that price tag, encouraged by government prize money and rising tax breaks and carbon credits.",

But the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) pathway to net zero by 2050 calls for pulling 80 million metric tons of CO2 from the air annually by 2030, and more than a billion metric tons by 2050.

The IPCC\u2019s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C calculated that up to 11 billion metric tons of CO2 could be drawn down in this manner per year by 2050, a huge chunk of today\u2019s roughly 35 billion metric tons in emissions.

But these methods don\u2019t touch legacy CO2, which is more dilute in the atmosphere. Pulling CO2 straight from the air is expensive, but it can be done nearly anywhere, with easily quantifiable results.

            "Today, there are two main strategies for air capture, each of which involves large fans that pull air into a processing area.

            "The second strategy absorbs CO2 into a liquid, transfers the CO2 to limestone pellets, and uses very high temperatures (about 600 degrees C) \u2014 typically supplied by a fossil-fuel-powered furnace \u2014 to remove the CO2 and recover the reagents. The CO2 released from the furnace can be captured too. This system requires a lot of water. But the chemical process is well suited to very large operations. This technique, as developed by the British Columbia-based company Carbon Engineering, is powering Stratos.",

The California-based company Heirloom, which opened the first commercial air capture plant in the U.S. last November, with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons a year, uses a variant on the limestone technology. The company simply exposes trays of powdered calcium oxide to air to soak up CO2 and turn it into limestone. Like the other limestone technique, the Heirloom process also releases CO2 from the limestone using high temperatures, but this facility uses renewable energy to do so.",

But these credits are still attractive because they are easily quantifiable, verifiable, and durable over long time periods. Microsoft announced in 2022 that it bought 10,000 metric tons of credits from Climeworks in a 10-year deal, though it did not disclose the price. 1PointFive has deals in place to sell credits to Amazon, Airbus, and other companies once it\u2019s up and running.",

The IEA estimates that the operational costs of direct air capture should get to between $230 and $630 per metric ton of CO2 once scaled up, depending in large part on energy costs, says Mathilde Fajardy, an IEA analyst. Others are less optimistic. According to Howard Herzog, of MIT\u2019s Energy Initiative, a reasonable estimate for the cost of direct air capture by 2030 is between $600 and $1,000 per metric ton of CO2. \u201cMost estimates out there are unrealistic,\u201d he says.",

            "To tackle both cost and energy use, the DOE\u2019s Carbon Negative Shot program, launched in 2021, ambitiously aims to get the cost of direct air capture below $100 per metric ton by sponsoring technology innovation. That price would make air capture profitable against, for example, a U.S. tax credit that, as of 2022, offers $180 per metric ton for large-scale stored CO2.",
            "Last December, the DOE put up more than $1 million in prize money for promising direct air capture technologies. There are seven semi-finalists. Elysia Labs, in Phoenix, for example, is developing a nanofiber-based sorbent that needs less of a pressure drop and thus requires less energy to pull CO2 from the air. And N\u016bxsen, in New York City, is developing an electrochemical cell that it says can capture and release CO2 without energy-intensive heat or pressure changes; the company plans to use small modular nuclear reactors to power its system.",
            "Meanwhile, some researchers are using artificial intelligence to accelerate innovation. Meta \u2014 the company behind Facebook and Instagram \u2014 is working with Georgia Tech on the OpenDAC project to help find better porous polymers to efficiently soak up and release CO2. Whether any of this proves useful at an industrial scale remains to be seen.",

            "Yet once CO2 is captured, companies need to decide what to do with it. The most carbon-negative option is to bury it deep underground. This is what Climeworks does in Iceland, for example, and plans to do with its upgraded facility, called Mammoth, due to launch this year. There are plenty of suitable geological repositories for buried CO2. But for now, this strategy is in the minority: the IEA reports that as of 2022, out of 18 plants operating globally, only two \u2014 both run by Climeworks in Iceland \u2014 bury their CO2.",
            "The other option is to use captured CO2 to make a product \u2014 like fertilizer, for example \u2014 or use it to carbonize beverages or as an ingredient in other industrial chemicals. This is what the majority of direct air capture plants do today. Heirloom, for example, works with a partner company to use its captured CO2 in making concrete. The biggest potential future market could be synthetic fuels for airplanes, wherein captured CO2 is combined with green hydrogen (made by splitting water with renewable electricity) to make synthetic hydrocarbons. The Norsk e-fuel project in Norway, the Haru Oni efuels plant in Chile, the AtmosFUEL project in the U.K., and Carbon Engineering, in Canada, are among companies pursuing this end use. In the IEA\u2019s pathway to net zero, about 35 percent of air-captured CO2 gets used for synthetic fuels by 2050, while the rest is buried.",
            "BQThe energy it takes to power capture, says one critic, would be better spent replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity.",
            "For now, though, about three-quarters of all globally captured CO2 (which comes mainly from industrial flue stacks) is currently being used for enhanced oil recovery, says Fajardy. The CO2 gets injected into oil wells to both bury it and to help push out more oil. This is controversial, as many note that it doesn\u2019t disincentivize fossil fuels. \u201cEnhanced oil recovery has been a stepping stone for early carbon capture and storage projects to help with the economics,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cIf your primary goal is negative emissions, it is not a good fit.\u201d But supporters point out that it\u2019s still burying CO2: If done carefully, they claim, then even after burning the recovered oil the process can come out as a net zero or even a net negative equation for carbon, though that\u2019s hard to quantify.",
            "What will happen to Stratos\u2019 CO2 hasn\u2019t yet been decided. The plant\u2019s location in Texas, and the fact that the companies building it, 1PointFive and Carbon Engineering, are both owned by Occidental Petroleum, has led some to speculate that this project will be used for enhanced oil recovery. Kel Coulson, Carbon Engineering\u2019s director of policy, says Stratos has several options for its CO2, including burying it in saline reservoirs or producing low-carbon products, which they call \u201cnet-zero oil.\u201d \u201cThe ultimate use of captured CO2 from Stratos will be driven by customer preference,\u201d Coulson says.",

            "The economic and environmental hurdles leave some concluding that air capture is not a good idea at all. Mark Jacobson, director of the Atmosphere/Energy program at Stanford University, has long been a detractor: The energy it takes to power capture, he says, would be far better spent replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity for decades to come. \u201cThere is never a case where direct air capture or carbon capture is useful,\u201d Jacobson says.",
            "Despite such criticism, the industry is moving forward. Last August, the DOE selected two megaton-scale projects for funding: another 1PointFive venture in Kleberg County, Texas, and an effort in Louisiana called Project Cypress, which has announced it will not participate in enhanced oil recovery. Two more hubs will follow from the DOE. And a handful of other megaton-scale efforts are planned elsewhere, including a Carbon Engineering effort in the United Arab Emirates and Project Bison in Wyoming, which is aiming to capture an ambitious 5 megatons a year by 2030.",
            "If all 100-plus projects on the drawing board go ahead as planned, they\u2019ll capture around 70 metric megatons of CO2 by 2030, says the IEA. That\u2019s very close to their 80 metric megaton target. But it\u2019s also a very big if."

But that is far from the amount experts say is necessary. In its most recent assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted that carbon dioxide removal \u201cis required to achieve global and national targets\u201d of limiting warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees C to avoid \u201cmajor, irreversible ecological and social impacts.\u201d\n",

For billions of years, the ocean has been absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing it to different forms of carbon that circulate via currents or settle to the seafloor. Today, the ocean soaks up 30 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, a capacity that is 42 times greater than the atmosphere\u2019s.

Reducing the acidity of seawater increases its alkalinity; the higher its alkalinity, the more atmospheric CO2 it can absorb and transform into stabler, inorganic carbon, which is less likely to seep back into the air. Since last year, the company Ebb Carbon has been operating its OAE system at the Sequin campus, filtering seawater through a series of membranes that, when pulsed with electricity, extract its acid.

To reduce acidification at oceanic scales would be impossible, but Eisaman says that isn\u2019t Ebb Carbon\u2019s goal. He pointed to the oyster farms in the bays and estuaries around Sequin that have been suffering from acidification, which thins the shells of bivalves. \u201cYou could use this to kind of keep that relatively small local body of water similar to a preindustrial equilibrium that is ideal for shellfish.\u201d ",

But some scientists say such efforts are risky. As it breaks down in the water column, this biomass produces organic carbon that \u201ccan be eaten by bacteria, which causes all sorts of transformations in the environment,\u201d says Ward. \u201cFor example, on the seafloor, you have organic carbon that can transform into different greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide and methane, depending on the conditions.

            "Ebi: And thank you to the media for covering this story and helping people to understand that indeed they are at risk. Heat is a silent killer. Some early warning signs of heat stress are nausea, fatigue, and dizziness. But it can be challenging, because often the first sign that people are in trouble is they get confused and can\u2019t always judge for themselves what is happening. It means that all of us need to pay attention to family, friends, and colleagues to make sure that they\u2019re doing okay when the temperatures are high.",

It does take a while for the cells and the organs to start reacting to the high temperature. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s 24 hours after the start of a heat wave when you start seeing the impacts.",

This emphasis on whether it\u2019s going to be livable doesn\u2019t take into account the creativity of human beings. We live in all kinds of environments that are not livable. People live in Antarctica for several months a year. Humans have found ways to modify infrastructure, to modify clothing, behavioral patterns, to be able to survive in very extreme conditions. Our emissions of greenhouse gases are making it more complicated, of course. And so putting the emphasis on how we can prevent those deaths is, from my perspective, a priority.",

It\u2019s not just telling people it\u2019s hot. It\u2019s telling them what they can do about it and ensuring they have access to services, making sure that there are cooling shelters, making sure that there\u2019s outreach to the unhoused, making sure that your outdoor workers are protected, that people living in elderly care institutions have access to cooling.\n",

            "*The_South_Belridge_Oil_Field_in_Kern_County,_California",
            "Down on the south end of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, oil rigs have plumbed the earth like flocks of blackened drinking birds for more than a century. Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "fCParabolic mirrors at a solar thermal plant in Kramer Junction, California. \nWarren Gretz / NREL",
            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

            "Researchers at NREL had been thinking about something like GeoTES for years, but they needed funding and land to make it a reality, which led them to partner with a Kern County-based energy investment firm, Premier Resource Management, in Bakersfield. In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea. By early this year, when California officially announced a ban on new permits for hydraulic fracking, they were fully focused on a way to give the old wells new life \u2014 as a battery, of sorts.\n",
            "BQTo survive a downturn in oil and gas, Kern County aims to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub.",
            "In its heyday in the mid-1980s, Kern County produced 256 million barrels of oil a year, and it remains the seventh-largest oil producing county in the U.S. Despite the industry\u2019s harm \u2014 more people per capita die from chronic lower respiratory disease here than anywhere else in California \u2014 drilling still pumps $13 billion a year into the local economy. Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

            "The geothermal industry would appear to offer a relatively seamless shift for many oilfield workers. Often, contractors can simply apply their skills to hot water instead of oil. As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",
            "Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology for the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council, a global nonprofit that works to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage, cautions that 10-hour energy-storage solutions will help us get through the swing from night to day, but that we produce and consume renewable energy on a scale that spans seasons.\n",
            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",
            "BQThe world will need up to 100,000 tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean doubling mining.",
            "Another driver of the search for new sources of uranium, which is essential to nuclear reactors, is geopolitics. The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts. But based on the industry\u2019s track record of polluting air, water, and soil with both radioactivity and heavy metals, and its obfuscation of mining\u2019s environmental threats, many observers \u2014 especially Indigenous people, who have borne the brunt of past uranium mining and who still suffer health problems linked with unremediated mining sites \u2014 remain skeptical.\n",
            "Exploration continues nonetheless. \u201cEveryone is convinced there is going to be a much larger demand for uranium going forward,\u201d said Matthew L.

            "If small modular reactors \u2014 units that can produce up to 300 megawatts of energy \u2014 prove efficient and economical, Wald says, they could be mass produced quickly and further increase the demand for uranium. There are plans for several small modular reactors, which have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, currently underway in the U.S. and Canada. \n",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world will need up to 100,000 metric tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean nearly doubling mining from current levels. And so companies around the globe are both looking for new deposits and reopening old mines. In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",

            "Greenland, meanwhile, is going against this trend. Concerned with the possible health impacts of mining, the Indigenous Inuit government in 2021 banned prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of uranium. And in 2023 it denied a permit for an Australian company to mine a massive deposit of rare earth metals called Kvanefjeld because bringing them to the surface would also convey uranium, with which it is commingled. ",
            "What will this new era of uranium mining mean for the environment? Historically, the industry has polluted groundwater, surface water, and soil around the world with radioactive waste and dust, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage. In some places, damage has been remediated by industry and government. But in many cases, due to cost or the difficulty of remediation, the pollution still contaminates the environment.",
            "But supporters of uranium mining say that new methods and technologies are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past and have far smaller footprints. That\u2019s because most new mines now use in-situ leaching, in which ore is left in the ground and miners recover the earth\u2019s minerals by dissolving them with hydrogen peroxide or an acid or alkaline leach.

Fifty-seven percent of the world\u2019s total uranium was produced using in-situ leaching in 2019, up from 16 percent in 2000, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group.",

The Obama administration proposed tighter standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by in-situ uranium mining, with a focus on groundwater protection and restoration, but the Trump administration rolled those regulations back. According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this. It sounds straightforward, and it is.\u201d ",

            "In 2016, the mine\u2019s owner, Energy Fuels Resources, was pushing forward with construction when it ruptured a perched aquifer \u2014 a confined pool of water sitting above the local water table. The company pumped this excess water into an open-air holding pond. But the pond wasn\u2019t big enough, so the company used water cannons to spray the overflow, which was tainted with arsenic and uranium at levels well above federal standards, into the sky to enhance the evaporation rate.\n",
            "Because it is in a sensitive natural and cultural area, the Pinyon Plain mine has raised objections from a long list of tribal officials and environmentalists. As Energy Fuels Resources pushes forward with mining, experts fear it could leak radioactivity into nearby groundwater that serves the Havasupai Tribe and flows into the waters of the Grand Canyon.\n",
            "\u201cThe aquifer feeds the Grand Canyon springs,\u201d said Taylor McKinnon, Southwest director of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cThey are incredibly important biologically and important to the Havasupai, whose name, People of the Blue-Green Water, ties to one of those springs.\u201d\n",

He has worked on uranium issues in the Southwest since 2007 and is battling the Pinyon Plain mine because of its potential to contaminate groundwater. Many of those sites \u201ccontinue to pollute,\u201d McKinnon adds. \u201cAs you can imagine, that rightfully casts doubt on regulators and industry\u2019s claims that it\u2019s going to be done right this time.\u201d",

The water flowed onto the Navajo Nation, where radioactive pollution remains in waterways and in soil where livestock graze. Every year, the community commemorates the spill by walking to the site of the dam breach and offering healing prayers.\n",
            "Studies have found that proximity to uranium mines increases the likelihood of illness, including kidney disease, hypertension, and other chronic diseases; a 2019 study revealed elevated autoimmunity in people living near abandoned mine sites on the Navajo Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the risk of radiation,\u201d says Eric Jantz, an attorney at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. \u201cBut also the chemical properties of mine waste\u201d\u2014 including arsenic and other heavy metals \u2014 \u201cthat are really problematic from a public health standpoint.\u201d\n",

            "Last November, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and U.S. climate envoy John Kerry shook hands on a pledge to triple renewable energy globally by 2030. It was hailed as a welcome revival of climate cooperation between the world\u2019s biggest and second-biggest emitters of greenhouse gases and offered hope that the two veteran climate negotiators had found a way through a blizzard of negative diplomatic exchanges to keep alive the prospects for greater global ambition on tackling climate change. ",
            "In one key sector essential to that ambition, however, the Chinese government can argue, with some justification, that it is China, not the United States, that is in the lead. In a world in which national climate targets are being missed, the speed and scale of expansion in China\u2019s installed renewable capacity is unmatched. ",
            "In 2020, for example, China pledged to reach 1,200 gigawatts of renewables capacity by 2030, more than double its capacity at that time. At its present pace, it will meet that target by 2025, and could boast as much as 1,000 gigawatts of solar power alone by the end of 2026, an achievement that would make a substantial contribution to the 11,000 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity that the world needs to meet the 2030 targets of the Paris Agreement. Fossil fuels now make up less than half of China\u2019s total installed generation capacity, a dramatic reduction from a decade ago when fossil fuels accounted for two-thirds of its power capacity. \n",
            "BQIn 2022, China installed roughly as much solar capacity as the rest of the world combined, then doubled additional solar in 2023.",
            "When the International Energy Authority issued its assessment of the pledge to triple renewables globally by 2030, it pointed out that the 50 percent increase in global renewable installations in 2023 was largely driven by China. In 2022, China installed roughly as much solar photovoltaic capacity as the rest of the world combined, then went on in 2023 to double new solar installations, increase new wind capacity by 66 percent, and almost quadruple additions of energy storage.",
            "For the past two decades, China has been notorious as the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, a country that also uses as much heavily polluting coal as the rest of the world combined. How did it also become the world\u2019s renewable powerhouse? ",
            "Part of the answer goes back to investment decisions made in the mid-2000s when China\u2019s decades-long phase of rapid GDP growth was coming to an end. Labor costs were rising, and China\u2019s development model, with its overwhelming dependence on coal, had plunged China into multiple crises of air, soil, and water pollution. In the first decade of this century, China\u2019s emissions more than doubled, and by 2006 it had overtaken the U.S. to earn the unwelcome title of the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by volume.\n",

            "China\u2019s leadership was alert to the negative diplomatic impacts of being the world\u2019s worst polluter, especially in those countries most vulnerable to climate impacts. At the same time, China\u2019s own exposure to climate change effects, on top of its escalating pollution crisis and the public unrest it was generating, was becoming a significant topic in Beijing\u2019s top-level policy discussions. China\u2019s planners were looking for investments that would create an opportunity for a more advanced technological future, and this coincided with the need to clean up China\u2019s environment and the global effort to cut emissions. All this pointed to supporting the development of the renewable technologies the world would need if it was to avoid climate catastrophe. ",
            "In the next and every subsequent five-year plan, China made strategic investments in all aspects of renewable technologies, from solar and wind capacity, green hydrogen, and geothermal projects to research and investment in battery storage and its supply chains. In the first phase of its rapid industrial development starting in the 1990s, China had been obliged to license technologies owned by others. Now the strategic ambition was to dominate the field, positioning China as the global supplier of goods to an increasingly carbon-constrained world. \n",
            "BQIf China has been clear about the opportunity side of climate change, it has been less enthusiastic about cutting its own emissions.",
            "Within a decade, China had largely achieved its goal of dominating not only the production of solar and wind technologies, but it had developed a near monopoly on every aspect of the supply chains, including the mining and processing of the rare-earths and strategic minerals essential for the clean energy revolution. Today, China has more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s solar manufacturing capacity. The extraordinary scale of China\u2019s renewables sector output has driven down prices worldwide, and this is a key factor in reducing the cost barrier to renewable systems for poorer countries. Today China not only holds important positions in wind and battery technologies, but a Chinese company, BYD, has become the world\u2019s biggest EV manufacturer, and China is poised to pose a formidable global challenge in all aspects of electric transportation to established vehicle brands.",
            "But if China has been clear about the opportunity side of climate change, it has been less enthusiastic about cutting its own emissions: In the first two decades of the century, the economy remained overwhelmingly dependent on coal, and China argued that committing to major cuts in emissions would be an unfair constraint on its right to develop. That began to change with President Xi Jinping\u2019s surprise announcement at the 2020 U.N. General Assembly that China would peak its emissions \u201cwell before\u201d 2030, as it had promised in Paris in 2015, and in an important new offer, that it would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060. A radical renewables program would be essential to meeting those goals.\n",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17082093/embed",
            "Xi Jinping\u2019s announcement attracted global attention, but its most galvanizing effect was at home. It sent a powerful political signal in favor of renewable investments across China, and the nation\u2019s giant state-owned enterprises, including its traditional energy companies, were compelled to take notice, both of Xi\u2019s unequivocal message and the policy initiatives it triggered. The National Energy Administration (NEA), the body that regulates China\u2019s energy sector, also recognized that new policies and mechanisms would be needed if China was to implement Xi\u2019s targets. ",
            "Massive wind farms were already operating in northern China, and now a series of utility-scale clean energy bases involving many of China\u2019s massive state-owned utility companies were planned for the relatively empty western desert regions. These bases, a combination of vast solar arrays and wind farms, are to be connected to markets in eastern China through high-speed transmission lines. The projects take advantage both of high solar radiation in the desert and large amounts of cheap, available land. China aims to build more than 200 such bases to help to raise its renewables capacity to about 3.9 terawatts by 2030, more than three times its 2022 total.",
            "BQChina still generates about 70 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels, as renewable energy use lags behind installed capacity.",
            "In addition to these desert projects, the NEA promised in 2021 to improve rural grid transmission and allow village collectives to invest in distributed renewable power and share the benefits. To promote the adoption of distributed rooftop solar, the NEA launched the Whole County PV program, a national pilot scheme that aimed to install photovoltaics in roughly half of China\u2019s county-level rural administrations, comprising about a quarter of China\u2019s population. The program set targets of providing solar to 20 percent of residential properties, with separate targets for commercial buildings.",
            "The utility-scale developments had left out China\u2019s more scattered rural populations, so showing interest in a rural model in which customers both draw energy down and sell energy back to the grid was a radical departure for China\u2019s traditional central planners and grid operators. The NEA now aimed to include China\u2019s neglected rural population in the renewable revolution. By the end of 2022, 676 counties had signed up for the scheme, and more than 51 gigawatts of new distributed solar photovoltaic was installed, nearly half of it on from rural rooftops. In total, by the end of 2022, China had built roughly 157 gigawatts of distributed photovoltaic capacity, more than double that of the U.S.",

            "The NEA also announced plans to expand the financing channels for renewables and improve incentives and market mechanisms, aiming to shift the state-owned banks from favoring state-owned enterprises and from undervaluing both the private sector and new policy initiatives.",
            "Today the renewables sector is one of the relatively few bright spots in the Chinese economy, having benefited from a surge in government stimulus as Beijing tried to restore growth hit hard by Covid-19. The massive real estate market, which boosted China\u2019s GDP figures for more than three decades, is teetering on the edge of collapse. The pandemic and the downturn in global economies that followed has hit China\u2019s exports, and nervous Chinese consumers are sitting on their wallets in case things get worse. Renewable energy, however, seems to have a bright future, but fully realizing that potential will demand further radical reforms.",
            "Renewables now account for half of China\u2019s installed capacity, but there has also been a surge in permits for new coal-fired power plants, and China still generates about 70 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels. This means actual renewable energy use is lagging behind installed capacity.",
            "BQThe government has announced plans to create a unified electricity system, merging regional grids into one national market.",
            "This is largely due to problems with China\u2019s giant grid, which prefers high-speed transmission from reliable sources to the challenge of integrating variable renewable power and the associated challenge of matching intermittent supply to demand. For the grid companies, China\u2019s coal-fired power plants are steady and predictable, and they are allowed many more hours of grid access than renewables. In addition, anxieties about energy security are now high on the policy agenda, reinforced by geopolitical tensions and recent droughts that affected hydropower output and resulted in power cuts. In China, energy security still means coal.",
            "China\u2019s current climate and energy ambitions are embedded in a series of policy statements, including its current five-year plan. Although China\u2019s political culture places a heavy premium on meeting its declared goals, a number of energy and climate commitments are currently off target, largely because of the energy sector\u2019s continuing dependence on coal.\n",
            "In 2021, in the Paris Agreement commitments that China submitted to the U.N., Beijing pledged to \u201cstrictly limit\u201d coal growth, strictly control new coal power, reduce energy and carbon intensity by 2025, increase the share of non-fossil energy sources to 20 percent by 2025 and to 25 percent by 2030, and to generate 50 percent of the increase in energy use from 2020 to 2025 from renewable sources. Far from limiting coal growth, however, according to analysis by Carbon Brief, a new coal rush is underway as operators seize what they see as possibly the last opportunity for new plants.",

            "fCAn EV battery factory in Nanjing.\nFeature China / Future Publishing via Getty Images",
            "The figures confirm the trend: The average growth rate of coal consumption increased eightfold in the last two years, from 0.5 percent per year between 2016 and 2020 to 3.8 percent per year between 2021 and 2023, and new coal power approvals quadrupled between 2022 and 2023 as compared with the five years before the government pledged its strict controls.",
            "This has contributed to a 12 percent rise in emissions in the energy sector between 2020 and 2023. To meet the government\u2019s 2025 carbon intensity targets, emissions would have to peak this year and decline by 4 to 6 percent by 2025. Some analysts consider these targets already out of reach, but if China is to stay on track with its long- and short-term goals, the government must honor its pledge to control new coal capacity and continue its rapid buildup of renewables.",
            "To use its renewables capacity efficiently however, China has recognized that power system reforms are long overdue. The National Development and Reform Commission recently announced plans to create a unified national power market by 2030, merging its six regional grids into one nationwide electricity market to better manage fluctuations in supply and demand. If that can be achieved, China could not only enhance its position as the global leader in installed capacity for renewable but might also make better use of the clean energy it produces."

This extraordinary initiative \u2014 more than a dozen years in the making \u2014 is intended to save the imperiled northern spotted owl from extinction.\n",
            "Barred owls have been moving west into spotted owl territory for decades, aggressively outcompeting them for prey and nesting sites. If its plan is adopted, the federal agency will soon launch what\u2019s expected to be a three-decade campaign in which certified hunters will eventually shoot nearly half a million barred owls.\n",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re wildlife conservation professionals, and we don\u2019t take this lightly,\u201d said Bridget Moran, a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service in Bend, Oregon, who has been working on the strategy. \u201cThe spotted owl is at a crossroads. We have the science to indicate what we can do to conserve spotted owls, and [it\u2019s] telling us that we must manage barred owls in addition to habitat to save them.\u201d\n",
            "The plan, as presented in a final environmental impact statement, has garnered opposition, largely from animal welfare and anti-hunting groups, but also support from mainstream environmental groups. ",
            "The Fish and Wildlife Service adopted its plan based largely on a study of \u201cinvader removal,\u201d published in 2021, in which researchers set up five pairs of test plots. On one plot, they left barred owls and spotted owls to their own devices. On the other plot, they shot any barred owls that entered.",
            "BQA long-term field experiment showed that where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized.",
            "The researchers eliminated 2,485 barred owls over several years in the managed plots. Where barred owls and spotted owls were left alone, the population of the threatened species declined around 12 percent each year. Where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized.",
            "\u201cThe use of long-term field experiments to test the effectiveness of removals in benefitting impacted native species is rare,\u201d said David Wiens, a U.S. Geological Survey biologist and the lead author of the paper. \u201cThis study is the largest field experiment ever conducted on the demographic consequences of invasive competition between predatory birds.\u201d",
            "Steep population declines of northern spotted owls, which live only in old-growth and mature second-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, raised alarms more than 35 years ago. Continued logging of those forests, experts said at the time, would drive the bird to extinction. In June 1990, the bird was listed as a threatened species in the Pacific Northwest and logging in its habitat was restricted.\n",
            "The federal action created a storm of controversy, but it prevented the extinction of the spotted owl. Efforts to prevent the disappearance of the owl, then and now, are not just about protecting a charismatic predator. Spotted owls are an indicator species for the health of the old-growth ecosystem: If a forest has adequate populations of flying squirrels, mice, and salamanders to sustain spotted owls, the forest is likely to be diverse and healthy. Spotted owls only live in mature forests, while barred owls can thrive in both young and old forests and eat a far wider range of prey.",

But while the logging battles have died down, the new controversy over the proper response to what has been called an invasion of barred owls has heated up as the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s final decision nears.",
            "Biologists believe that the barred owl began moving out of eastern North America and across Canada with the westward movement of European settlers. In a two-part paper, the former FWS biologist Kent Livezey concluded that the lack of trees on the Great Plains created a barrier to owl movement until settlers appeared. They excluded fire from ecosystems, which eventually allowed forests to spread, and they planted trees on farms and in towns, all of which provided an expansion of roosting habitat. Wheat and other grain farms may have increased the numbers of mice and other prey.",
            "Barred owls were first observed in Washington, Oregon, and California in the 1970s, and today there are more than 100,000 of them living in the northern spotted owl\u2019s territory in those states, according to federal biologists.",
            "When barred owls move into spotted owl habitat, the impact is rapid and thorough. The interlopers are larger and more aggressively territorial. They drive spotted owls away from their nests and outcompete the smaller birds for food. At least half the spotted owls in the forests of the West have been lost to barred owls, says the Fish and Wildlife Service, and some places have lost three-quarters of their historic population. When barred owls colonized Redwoods State and National Parks in Northern California, starting in 1987, the spotted owls all but disappeared.",
            "BQBiologists considered capturing and sterilizing barred owls, but they would still return to their territory and displace spotted owls.",
            "The plan to shoot barred owls will protect the northern spotted owl, a subspecies that occurs in Northern California, Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia, which now has fewer than five northern spotted owls, including a lone female.",
            "The number of northern spotted owls in the United States isn\u2019t precisely known: Estimates put the population at just a few thousand. Its continuing decline, however, is steep. In areas where roughly 200 spotted owls lived in the early 2000s, only two or three birds remain, said Robin Bown, a FWS biologist in Oregon. The bird is currently listed as threatened. FWS scientists say it is warranted for listing as endangered, but the agency says such action is precluded because it must focus on higher priority species.\n",
            "The California spotted owl, another subspecies, was last year proposed for listing as endangered in the southern part of its range and threatened in the Sierra Nevada. Barred owls are just beginning their invasion of that bird\u2019s habitat, and the FWS strategy is to dispatch them as soon as they are detected. The Mexican spotted owl is listed as threatened in both the U.S. and Mexico but is not currently threatened by the barred owl.",
            "Though the plan to kill hundreds of thousands of owls is extreme, federal wildlife officials say other options simply aren\u2019t available. Capturing the birds and moving them elsewhere was contemplated. \u201cWe contacted the eastern states where barred owls are native, to see if they wanted barred owls back,\u201d said Bown. \u201cThey said \u2018no.\u2019 Their existing habitat is already full.\u201d Moving them could also spread disease and parasites.

To protect endangered warblers and other songbirds, hundreds of thousands of cowbirds, a nest parasite, have been killed annually.

In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature took the step of classing the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) as critically endangered. Around the same time, the European Union adopted a comprehensive eel regulation establishing measures to support the recovery of the stock, including through seasonal fishing closures and limits.",

In its annual report for 2024, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) \u2014 the regional fishery advisory body whose findings provided the basis for the EU\u2019s Eel Regulation \u2014 is now urging that \u201cthere should be zero catches in all habitats.\u201d For many biologists, closing down the eel fishery, at least temporarily, seems like the last option left after many years of neglect. \u201cIt\u2019s been a century of \u2018we knew the problem and we didn\u2019t face it,\u2019\u201d Willem Dekker, a Dutch biologist known as the architect of the EU Eel Regulation, told me.",

            "European eels are born in the Sargasso Sea, an amorphous body of water in the Western Atlantic bordered not by land but by shifting ocean currents. The tiny, transparent, larvae are then carried on the current to Europe\u2019s Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs. (Freud spent the spring of 1876 in Trieste, about a hundred miles northeast of Comacchio, fruitlessly picking apart healthy eels from the Adriatic for his advisor in Vienna.)\n",

            "The eel\u2019s mysterious life cycle resists standard fisheries science. To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

But they are struggling to come up with solutions, since the reasons for the European eel\u2019s collapse are not straightforward. Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980. There are clearly a number of factors at play in this long decline, but the extent of each is uncertain.",
            "Overfishing, it seems, is only one piece of the puzzle, as shown by the failure of the EU\u2019s fishing regulations to produce a recovery. Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle. The recent surge of illegal trafficking of juveniles to Asia has surely put another dent in the population.",
            "\u201cPeople want to have a clear answer, but we\u2019re not able to provide it,\u201d admitted Caroline Durif, one of the current chairs of the ICES Working Group on Eels.

            "In order to ban the capture of European eels, as proposed by ICES, the European Parliament would need to repeal and amend the current EU directive requiring countries to adopt measures to support the stock\u2019s recovery. This seems unlikely given that a 2023 committee vote on a resolution calling for renewed commitment to the regulation won the support of 80 percent of delegates present. \u201cThere\u2019s no will to do a ban, and also it wouldn\u2019t help,\u201d Andrew Kerr, the chair of a nonprofit coalition of conservationists, scientists, and commercial fishermen called the Sustainable Eel Group (SEG), told me over video call from his home in England. \u201cThe eel is much more complex than that, and if you stop fishing, you\u2019re not going to save the eel. What you need is a very controlled level of fishing, but we have to work on all the environmental factors.\u201d",
            "Durif acknowledges that the EU still needs some convincing from the scientific community before it will accept a zero-catch limit. \u201cThe EU is working on making a special request to ICES to see if we can measure the efficiency of the regulation, which we keep on saying we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

            "The mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",
            "Kerr has been writing to the EU for over a decade and has spoken to gathered authorities at the Hague on the problem of illegal glass eel shipments. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to make eel become an EU priority in countertrafficking,\u201d he said. In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",
            "BQIn Sweden, the threat of hydropower plants to migrating eels is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing.",
            "Eel fishermen around Europe fear their livelihoods being put on hold by a fishing ban, and they argue that the authorities should be addressing other known mortality factors. In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years. The population numbers continue to go down; soon we risk going underneath the survival threshold of the species.\u201d"

            "In the wild, octopods are solitary animals that roam freely in the sea. They spend their days and nights catching prey with their eight arms. With their big eyes, they observe closely what\u2019s going on around them in reefs and on the ocean floor, tasting with their suction cups and changing the color of their skin to blend with their environment.",
            "For many people, such unique traits have made a Spanish company\u2019s more-than-four-year effort to raise octopods for food in factory-like conditions all the more horrific. In the farm planned for construction off Spain\u2019s Gran Canaria island, the animals would be kept in small, narrow cages stacked atop each other in a multistory industrial building. To kill the octopods, they would be placed in ice water at minus 3 degrees Celsius (27 degrees F). According to plans leaked to the BBC, the farm was designed to produce 3,000 metric tons of protein-rich meat from 1 million animals per year. ",
            "Nueva Pescanova, the Spanish company behind what would be the world\u2019s first commercial octopus farm, says it\u2019s addressing a growing demand for pulpo, protein-rich octopus meat, citing industry projections that global consumption will increase by more than 20 percent by 2028, compared to today. The company also claims that octopus farming could help conserve stocks in the wild.",

            "Animal rights activists from around the world disagree and are calling for an immediate halt to the approval process. \u201cWe must not condemn these highly sensitive animals to such misery,\u201d they wrote in a petition to the Spanish government and the European Union parliament.",
            "So far, final approval has not yet been granted for the project. But the controversy raises far larger questions: What kind of relationship do humans want to have with octopods, which show the highest levels of invertebrate intelligence in the world? How intensively should we exploit them, either for food, science, or display, and how well are we protecting them?",
            "For centuries, humans have eaten octopods. But apart from their food value, the animals were considered so alien that they received only scant attention, even from science. In Europe, they were mainly regarded as monsters, rumored to sink ships. In the 19th century, Victor Hugo wrote, \u201cIf there are no limits to the imagination when it comes to creating something hideous, the octopus can be considered a masterpiece.\u201d But the more people observed and learned about these creatures in aquariums, the more their disgust turned to sympathy, even affection.",

People were taken aback when Billye, a Pacific giant octopus, quickly learned how to remove screw caps from jars at the Seattle Aquarium. After an octopus in Germany, which had become famous by predicting the outcome of World Cup soccer matches, died, newspapers around the world eulogized him. And in 2020, the Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher was watched by millions of viewers.",
            "Recent research has revealed that octopods can plan ahead, identify and remember humans individually, and solve complex tasks. Last year, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology showed that, just like humans, octopods have two very different sleep phases, one deep and one with increased bodily activity. Researchers even posit that they can dream. All of that is quite remarkable for a creature that lacks a spine and is more closely related to ants, slugs, and worms than to vertebrates. ",
            "Biologists know of about 300 species of octopods, inhabiting many different parts of the ocean, from coastal lagoons to depths of 5,000 meters. Some have a huge range, like the common octopus, which can be found in the tropics, subtropics, and in temperate waters. Some are extremely rare, like the roughy umbrella octopus, which is known only from a few locations near New Zealand\u2019s Chatham Islands.",

            "Apart from their body architecture, almost all octopods share a predatory and solitary lifestyle (social octopods have been observed in just a few small colonies off Australia, Japan, and Nicaragua). All octopods live for between one and three years, and after hatching their eggs, females die. Despite these characteristics, octopods show signs of intelligence usually attributed only to millions of years of intensively social lifestyles in mammals. Scientists are still struggling to understand how something so short-lived as octopods \u2014 which have no chance to learn from parents and peers \u2014 can perform its cognitive feats.",
            "When the scientist Nikolaus Rajewsky visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium a few years ago, his gaze fell on a dark, motionless lump with large eyes. The octopus and he looked each other in the eye for half an hour. The scientist felt strangely moved. \u201cOn the one hand, I had this animal without a spine in front of me, a relative of snails,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand on the other, there was a real individual communicating with me as a human being.\u201d",
            "The encounter left a deep impression. \u201cI often think about that moment,\u201d says Rajewsky, who heads the Berlin Institute for Medical Systems Biology, where he studies gene regulation and, more recently, octopus intelligence. In 2022, Rajewsky published a paper suggesting that the parallels between mammalian and octopod brains lie in their genetic programming \u2014 which is curious, because their last common ancestor, a primitive wormlike animal, lived more than 500 million years ago. But in their brain cells, cephalopods have mechanisms \u2014 called microRNAs \u2014 that are considered a prerequisite for intelligent behavior in mammals, too.",

In 2022, the British government included octopods in the list of \u201csentient beings\u201d of its Animal Welfare Act, according them a status like vertebrates. And in September 2023, the U.S. National Institutes of Health asked the public for input on new rules for how cephalopods \u2014 a group that includes nautiluses, squid, and cuttlefish \u2014 could be treated better in research labs.",
            "This increased level of concern is in stark contrast to how octopods are dealt with in fisheries. Between 350,000 and 500,000 tons of between 20 and 100 different species of octopods are caught each year for human consumption, up from about 100,000 tons in the early 1970s, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n",
            "Octopods are often taken as bycatch in industrial-scale fishing operations, but they are not discarded, due to their monetary value. In more artisanal fisheries, especially along coastlines in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Portugal, they are the main target. Hunters go after the animals with traps that simulate safe hiding spaces. Spears are sometimes used in East Africa. In coastal communities, octopods can be an important source of protein and \u201ca crucial resource for the livelihoods of vulnerable people,\u201d according to Sustainable Fisheries, a U.S.-based NGO.",
            "BQThe FAO warns that \u201cglobal octopus landings have been on a declining trend for several years.\u201d",
            "But experts are deeply worried about the lack of an international management system and, in many parts of the world, coordinated catch restrictions. For whales and for some fish species, monitoring efforts lead to strict annual quotas, which are at least partly enforced. But for octopods, the global industry is in many circumstances running blind: they are harvested without knowledge of their species or reproductive capacity, according to a comprehensive assessment by a team of scientists led by Warwick Sauer, from Rhodes University in South Africa.\n",
            "For example, a study revealed that in a large part of the Atlantic, annual catches of the common octopus might have been five times higher than official statistics indicate. \u201cGlobal catch data for octopuses should be considered a very rough estimate of total harvest, and likely to be a considerable underestimate,\u201d the FAO warns.",
            "Along coastlines, national or regional rules may limit how often artisanal octopus fishers can go out to sea or set a minimum catch size to protect potential offspring. \u201cBut rules are only as good as controls, and in many areas these don\u2019t exist,\u201d says Daniel Oesterwind, a marine biologist with the Th\u00fcnen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries in Rostock, Germany, and a member of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council. Even the E.U., which prides itself as a champion of nature protection, so far has no monitoring and governance system in place for octopods in its common fishery policy.",

            "Oesterwind points out that projections are hindered by the octopods\u2019 short lifespan. \u201cThey reproduce only once, which leads to strong fluctuations, so populations trends are difficult to predict,\u201d he says. This is a hazard for their survival, too: \u201cIf one generation of spawners is entirely removed, the stock will cease to exist.\u201d In some parts of the world, efforts are underway to stabilize populations. Fishers in Asturias, in Spain, and in Western Australia have committed to following rules \u2014 regarding the number of traps used by fishermen, the minimum weight of catch, and the fishing period \u2014 for certification as a sustainable fishery by the Marine Stewardship Council.",
            "In other countries, local communities are managing their own systems. In the shallow reefs around the Tanzanian island of Songosongo, for example, the common octopus and large blue octopus live in small caves. Villagers have long used spears to bring the animals ashore. However, as octopods have increasingly been traded and exported, overexploitation has become a big problem. To address this, communities have started to manage the fishery collaboratively.",

            "\u201cYou sit together, discuss, and find a solution,\u201d says Modesta Medard, the marine program coordinator at WWF Tanzania. To stop the downward trend in stocks, villages chose a way that was as simple as it was effective: they began to close the reefs for three months every year. \u201cIt was part of the traditional knowledge that octopods always live in a home for three months, grow up, and then move on,\u201d says Medard. The periodic closures, which gives the animals time to reproduce and grow, proved worthwhile. The average octopus catch has increased measurably, and with it, local income. At the same time, the reefs and their other inhabitants are better protected.\n",
            "While there is consensus among octopus scientists that such projects should get more support and be implemented in many more regions, opinions diverge on octopus farming.\n",

It leads to stress, conflict, and high mortality,\u201d says Jonathan Birch, who researches animal consciousness at the London School of Economics. \u201cIt is obvious that wild octopods lead a much better life than [octopods] fattened up in plastic containers to end up on our plates,\u201d says environmental scientist Jennifer Jacquet, of New York University.",

They see the biggest challenge in obtaining a sustainable artificial feed that\u2019s formulated from vegetarian sources. Otherwise, octopus farming might simply increase overexploitation of fish stocks.",

            "One leading octopus researcher, zoologist Louise Allcock of the University of Galway, thinks that the debate about the Spanish plan calls for a broader interrogation. \u201cPigs are also special animals, they are among the most intelligent creatures, and yet we keep them in atrocious conditions,\u201d she says. This is why, in her view, the entire food production system needs to be challenged. The aim, she says, should be to \u201cswitch to a plant-based diet as far as possible\u201d \u2014 and leave sentient, wild animals like octopods alone to roam the ocean."

By the end of his probe into the supply chain of JBS, the world\u2019s largest meat processing and packing company, Marcel Gomes reckons he and his team at the S\u00e3o Paulo-based nonprofit Rep\u00f3rter Brasil knew more about the origins of the beef it supplies from the Amazon to the world\u2019s hamburger chains and supermarkets than the company itself. ",
            "With grassroots support from labor unions and Indigenous communities, he had mapped the complex networks of cattle farms responsible for illegal deforestation. He then tracked the often-illicit beef through JBS\u2019s slaughterhouses and packing plants to the freezers, shelves, and customer trays of retail outlets and fast-food restaurants around the world. When his sleuths were done, the fingerprints of forest destruction were plain to see. Six of Europe\u2019s biggest retail chains reacted by halting purchases of JBS beef. \n",

            "Marcel Gomes: Well, Brazil is the world\u2019s biggest beef exporter. My country has more than 200 million cattle, and ranching is the single biggest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, where more than 40 percent of the cattle are raised. JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company. It exports leather \u2014 for instance to Germany, where it makes car seats \u2014 and biodiesel made from beef tallow. ",

            "Gomes: Since 2011, Brazil has had legislation intended to improve the transparency of sources of supply of beef and other agricultural commodities. So, at Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which was founded in 2008, we began to collect this public data on everything related to environmental, social, and labor issues. We started to cross-check the data so we could trace supply chains right from the ranch to consumers.",
            "Then we put this information together with data on areas where ranchers had been fined for environmental violations such as deforestation, and where there were reports of modern slavery and forced or child labor. We also used satellite images to identify which farms had seen deforestation each year, and we tapped into data on the transport of cattle from those farms to the slaughterhouses receiving the cattle.",

So, in 2021, we hired researchers in Europe and the U.S., as well as Brazil, to visit stores to find Brazilian beef and take pictures of the seals and export tracking numbers. Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from. For us it was very important to go to the supermarkets and take pictures, and to have that clear evidence.",
            "Then we connected both ends of the supply chain, and called everybody \u2014 the supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, the traders, JBS, the public health authorities, everyone \u2014 to tell them what we had found and ask for them to respond. Several supermarket chains in Europe believed our findings straight away and announced boycotts just as our report was published.

            "Gomes: Yes. It is common to move cattle from farm to farm in Brazil, often three or four times. There can be legitimate reasons for doing this, because cattle raising is quite a specialized business. But it can also cover up a \u201cdirty\u201d trail.",
            "In theory there are rules to prevent the trading of cattle from illegal to legal areas. But in practice it is very easy to do, especially when you have several members of a family doing the same business. One brother can move cattle to the land of another brother, with no paperwork. Also, you can change the boundaries of your own land, for instance, by turning one ranch into two, one clean and the other dirty. Then you can just trade with companies like JBS from the clean part. \n",

Over the past decade, the government has given subsidized solar pumps to almost 100,000 farmers. Those pumps now water more than a million acres and have enabled agricultural water use to increase by more than a quarter. But as a result, water tables are falling rapidly. There is little rain to replace the water being pumped to the surface. In places, the underground rocks are now dry down to 400 feet below ground.\n",
            "That is the effective extraction limit of the pumps, many of which now lie abandoned. To keep up, in what amounts to a race to the bottom of the diminishing reserves, richer farmers have been buying more powerful solar pumps, leaving the others high and dry or forcing them to buy water from their rich neighbors.\n",

            "For now, they can be great news for farmers, with the potential to transform agriculture and improve food security. The pumps can supply water throughout the daylight hours, extending their croplands into deserts, ending their reliance on unpredictable rains, and sometimes replacing existing costly-to-operate diesel or grid-powered pumps.",

            "For much of the 20th century, artificial irrigation of farmland boomed thanks to state and World Bank investment in reservoirs and in networks of canals to bring water to fields. Irrigation watered the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d of new high-yielding but thirsty crops, keeping a fast-growing world population largely fed.",
            "But many systems have reached their limits. Rivers are being emptied, and new investment has dried up. So in the past three decades, hundreds of millions of farmers in hot arid regions, from Mexico to the Middle East and South Asia, have switched to getting their water from underground. ",
            "Boreholes sunk into porous water-holding rocks now provide 43 percent of the world\u2019s irrigation water, according to a study last year by the World Bank. Irrigation is responsible for around 70 percent of the global underground water withdrawals, which are estimated at more than 200 cubic miles per year. This exceeds recharge from rainfall by nearly 70 cubic miles per year. \n",

But rather than calling a halt to groundwater withdrawals, policymakers are upping the ante by promoting solar power as a means of delivering yet more and cheaper underground water to fields. ",
            "The solar revolution on farms is happening with the best of intentions and is using a technology widely seen as environmentally beneficial. Farmers love the fact that their photovoltaic (PV) pumps do not require expensive and polluting diesel fuel or grid connections. Once installed, they can run all day at no cost, growing more food crops, or allowing their owners to expand their businesses \u2014 growing water-intensive cash crops, or earning income from selling spare water to neighbors. Many farmers also keep their old diesel or electric pumps to continuing pumping when the sun goes down.\n",
            "Development agencies and governments are equally keen.

            "The country is already the world\u2019s largest consumer of groundwater, with farmers each year pumping onto their fields an estimated 50 cubic miles more water than the monsoon rains replace. Unchecked, says Shah, solar power is set to make the situation worse.\n",
            "Sub-Saharan Africa could soon be on the same path. Shallow groundwater is present below fields in many places across the continent. But the cost of buying diesel fuel is prohibitively high for many farmers, and most rural areas are not connected to electricity grids. So, the arrival of stand-alone PV pumps is \u201ca game-changer for small-scale farms\u201d in sub-Saharan Africa, says Giacomo Falchetta, an energy and environment economist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. ",
            " There are already half a million PV irrigation pumps watering fields across the sub-Saharan region. But Falchetta calculates that in the future 11 million more could be deployed to irrigate 135 million acres of currently rainfed fields \u2014 an area the size of France. These pumps could supply a third of the unmet water needs of small farmers, who produce most of the food across sub-Saharan Africa.",

            "That is certainly the case in Yemen, on the south flank of the Arabian Peninsula, where the desert sands have a new look these days. Satellite images show around 100,000 solar panels glinting in the sun, surrounded by green fields. Hooked to water pumps, the panels provide free energy for farmers to pump out ancient underground water. They are irrigating crops of qat, a shrub whose narcotic leaves are the country\u2019s stimulant of choice, chewed through the day by millions of men.",
            "For these farmers, the solar irrigation revolution in Yemen is born of necessity. Most crops will only grow if irrigated, and the country\u2019s long civil war has crashed the country\u2019s electricity grid and made supplies of diesel fuel for pumps expensive and unreliable. So, they are turning en masse to solar power to keep the qat coming. ",
            "The panels have proved an instant hit, says Middle East development researcher Helen Lackner of SOAS University of London. Everybody wants one. But in the hydrological free-for-all, the region\u2019s underground water, a legacy of wetter times, is running out. \n",

The spread of solar power in Yemen \u201chas become an essential and life-saving source of power,\u201d both to irrigate food crops and provide income from selling qat, he says, but it is also \u201crapidly exhausting the country\u2019s scarce groundwater reserves.\u201d",

In a report with Musaed Aklan, a water researcher at the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies, Lackner predicts a \u201ccomplete shift\u201d to solar by 2028. But the basin may be down to its last few years of extractable water. Farmers who once found water at depths of 100 feet or less are now pumping from 1,300 feet or more.",
            "Some 1,500 miles to the northeast, in in the desert province of Helmand in Afghanistan, more than 60,000 opium farmers have in the past few years given up on malfunctioning state irrigation canals and switched to tapping underground water using solar water pumps. As a consequence, water tables have been falling typically by 10 feet per year, according to David Mansfield, an expert on the country\u2019s opium industry from the London School of Economics.\n",
            "An abrupt ban on opium production imposed by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers in 2022 may offer a partial reprieve. But the wheat that the farmers are growing as a replacement is also a thirsty crop. So, water bankruptcy in Helmand may only be delayed.",

In theory, switching from diesel or electricity to PV pumping should eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. But in practice, farmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing pumps, rather than replacing them. And, however it is pumped, the extra water available will also encourage farmers to adopt more intensive farming methods, using more fertilizer and machinery to grow thirstier cash crops, increasing the carbon footprint of the farm. ",
            "What is to be done? Groundwaters are notoriously hard to police. India\u2019s overpumping has been \u201ca colossal anarchy,\u201d says Shah. Some states have attempted to control non-solar pumps that run on grid electricity by restricting power supplies to farmers to a few hours every day. It had some effect, says Shah, who first proposed the idea. But many farmers responded by buying more powerful pumps.",

But Balasubramanya, who until recently worked with Shah in India, is doubtful. She warns that it might simply encourage more farmers to invest in solar panels, which could end up increasing water pumping further. \n",
            "In any case, controls based around the electricity grid will not work in rural Africa, where there is rarely any grid for farmers to either tap into or supply.",
            "None of this should be seen as a condemnation of solar power, says Balasubramanya. \u201cThe fundamental problem is not the solar technology itself.\u201d Whatever the technology, \u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\u201d",
            "But Balasubramanya says technology could come to the rescue. If PV pumps had to be sold with sensors that allowed monitoring of their output, then regulators could directly limit their use. Whether governments would do that in practice, given the conflicting priorities between immediate food production and longer-term management of water, is another matter."

            "For more than 15 years, Danielle Stevenson, who holds a PhD in environmental toxicology from the University of California, Riverside, has been pioneering a nature-based technique for restoring contaminated land, using fungi and native plants to break down toxins like petroleum, plastics, and pesticides into less toxic chemicals.",

Other fungi do not form mushrooms but create these beautiful dynamic networks throughout forests and grasslands that connect to the roots of plants. Fungi are largely overlooked, but it is a really important kingdom without which we wouldn\u2019t have soil or the carbon cycle or so many other really important functions in our ecosystems.\n",

And so there are fungi, they\u2019re called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, that can help plants do that better. And so on Taylor Yard [the Los Angeles railyard] and other sites, I\u2019ve worked with a combination of decomposer fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and plants that we previously found to be able to pull metals like lead and arsenic out of the soil into their aboveground parts.

You take a huge amount of biomass that contains these metals and either reduce it to a small amount of ash, through incineration, or sludge that contains concentrated metals, which can then be disposed of as hazardous waste or even reused.

My first question was, \u201cWhere are they going to go?\u201d I had this overwhelming feeling that they were going to push out more Black communities. I didn\u2019t want that to happen, so I wanted to educate people.",

I get a few small grants from organizations, but a lot of the funding comes from crowdsourcing from across the U.S. I assist people with food, shelter, water, clothing, paying their utility bills, paying their rent. But then they come to our community outreach meetings, they protest. [In late June] I was able to organize over 200 people from Texas and Louisiana to march with over 1,000 people down Wall Street to tell banks to stop funding environmental racism in our communities. I can\u2019t talk to a person in my community about CP2 coming when they can\u2019t feed their families, when they can\u2019t pay their rent.

The air smelled like rotten eggs one day and like Clorox the next. It made me sick. One of my sisters who worked at a petrochemical plant ended up being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. Her job was to watch the flare to see how big or small it would be, but she didn\u2019t know what was coming out of that thing.\n",
            "Three of my children have eczema, and two have asthma. My son was recently diagnosed with epilepsy. He started having seizures last year, at the age of 17. He had his first seizure while driving between two facilities that had flares going. Those flares are loud, they are bright, and those are seizure-triggering things. It was also a couple days after the explosion at [a local refinery]. I tried to get answers, but everybody I talked to said that the chemicals released from these facilities disappear out of your blood quickly.\n",

The state of Louisiana has said that even though cancer rates are going up, there is no way to say that they\u2019re going up because industry has grown. Louisiana is third in the nation for cancer rates. People hear about Cancer Alley, not understanding that the entire state of Louisiana is a cancer state. I live about three and a half hours from Cancer Alley, and my community is surrounded by more than a dozen petrochemical and gas facilities and three LNG facilities.\n",

The Vessel Project fought coal in Westlake, Louisiana, and right behind coal came LNG. And right behind LNG, now, you have [new] petrochemical plants.

            "What will it mean for policymaking on environmental and other issues, practically speaking, if the U.S. Supreme Court jettisons the Chevron doctrine?",
            "This question is on the minds of legal observers and environmental advocates as they wait for the justices to decide two consolidated cases in which the court has been asked to overrule the famous precedent that has stood for four decades. That ruling, in the 1984 case Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council, says that where Congress has not expressed itself clearly, leaving gaps or ambiguities in federal statutes, agencies should be allowed to adopt the interpretation they prefer, so long as that interpretation is reasonable. ",
            "The cases now before the Supreme Court \u2014 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless Inc. v. Department of Commerce \u2014 were brought by commercial fishing groups challenging a National Marine Fisheries Service rule, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. If the court decides to scrap the Chevron doctrine, it could have major implications for environmental policymaking and regulation on issues ranging from air pollution and climate change to clean water rules, public lands management, endangered species protection, and more.\n",
            "BQOverturning Chevron would reduce government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments. ",
            "There are two very different perspectives on the Chevron doctrine, which largely determine whether one thinks it ought to be overruled. Critics say that Chevron gives policymaking discretion to unaccountable agency bureaucrats, allows presidents to abuse their executive authority, and encourages members of Congress to shirk their legislative responsibilities. They charge that Chevron is \u201creliance-destroying\u201d because it allows policy \u201cflip-flops\u201d between administrations and that it cannot be squared with the landmark Marbury v. Madison decision, which ruled that courts \u201csay what the law is\u201d and established the principle of judicial review. If one believes that there is always a single best answer to how to interpret a given statutory provision, and that a skilled enough legal interpreter can always produce that best answer, then overturning Chevron has some intuitive appeal. Why ever defer to an agency when judges can just decide? ",
            "Supporters of Chevron contest each of these claims. Congress inevitably leaves certain interpretive question unresolved, they say, which means that some statutory provisions are capable of different understandings. And democratically elected presidents charged with executing the law are entitled to use this ambiguity to advance their policy preferences. (This is otherwise known as the \u201celections have consequences\u201d argument.) They would note that agencies are amply accountable to multiple overseers and restricted by many legal, political, and institutional constraints. And they would reject the idea that Chevron is somehow responsible for legislative shirking or gridlock and point to House and Senate rules that make passing legislation exceedingly difficult, along with hyper-partisanship. While accepting that judicial review is legitimate and necessary, they would also say that nothing in the Constitution requires courts to decide all legal questions with no deference to expert regulators.",

            "To the claim that there is one discernible \u201cbest\u201d answer to every hard question of statutory interpretation, they would say no, sometimes Congress has not been clear (whether because political compromise requires some degree of unclarity; or because Congress is not prescient; or intentionally wishes to leave agencies room to adapt to change; or because of the limits of language), and there is more than one arguably best answer. From this point of view, Chevron is a sensible default rule of decision. It keeps courts from substituting their judgments for an agency\u2019s \u2014 and that is how it should be, since the agency charged with day-to-day implementation will better know what is reasonable in the run-of-the-mill case. ",
            "I support the defense of Chevron, as my past writings have made clear. Overturning or enfeebling Chevron would have negative consequences. It would further concentrate power in the judiciary; reduce the government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments, as well as to social and economic change; sow disruption and disorder in the lower courts; and undermine the regulatory stability on which the normal course of business depends. For example, courts rather than agencies would decide what pollution standards are \u201crequisite to protect the public health\u201d and allow for an \u201cadequate margin of safety,\u201d as the Environmental Protection Agency is mandated to do; what it means for an upwind state to \u201ccontribute significantly\u201d to the failure of downwind states to meet national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act; and whether \u201charm\u201d to an endangered species is limited to direct applications of force or can include habitat destruction.",
            "BQIf Chevron is abandoned, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read a statute.",
            "First, overturning Chevron would shift substantial power to the judiciary to have the last word on many important questions of policy that arise under federal law. It is more democratic for interpretive decisions, which inevitably involve policy discretion, to be made by agencies \u2014 which are part of an executive branch headed by an elected president, and subject to ongoing oversight by Congress \u2014 rather than by unelected judges. Deciding what qualifies as the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d or whether implementing an offshore drilling plan would \u201cprobably cause serious harm or damage\u2026 to the marine, coastal or human environment\u201d \u2014 as the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to do \u2014 depends on a combination of legal, factual, and policy determinations. Agencies have research- and information-gathering capacity, and relevant expertise in areas of regulatory complexity, that courts do not possess. They are also required to solicit, consider, and respond to comments on their regulatory proposals from industry and other stakeholders, including states. Companies and their trade associations can and do weigh in through this process to shape rules that affect them, and to require agencies to explain themselves.",
            "*Justice_Amy_Coney_Barrett_has_suggested_overturning_the_Chevron_doctrine_could_lead_to_a_flood_of_li",
            "fCJustice Amy Coney Barrett has suggested overturning the Chevron doctrine could lead to a flood of litigation. \nTom Williams / CQ Roll Call via AP Images",
            "Some of the conservative justices have implied that overturning Chevron is necessary to protect congressional prerogatives and restore Congress to its rightful role in our separation of powers scheme. Yet Congress already has the means to constrain agency overreach and check the president\u2019s executive power. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress has required agencies to provide advance notice of their rules and can effectively cancel any rule before it takes legal effect through a fast-track, filibuster-proof process requiring only a majority vote. Congress can also make its wishes known in the annual appropriations process and can defund agency initiatives of which it disapproves. If anything, abandoning Chevron would make the presumed separation of powers imbalance worse, not better \u2014 Congress could still use vague language to avoid making hard policy choices, only now those policy choices would be made by courts.",
            "Second, without Chevron, it will be harder for agencies to adapt regulation to new circumstances, something we should want government to do. Under Chevron, agencies can consider the latest scientific advances and technology developments; re-examine costs and benefits; consult with stakeholders; and consider the president\u2019s policy preferences too, knowing that the next administration may adopt a different view \u2014 in which case the agency would then bear the burden of explaining to the public and the courts why that new understanding is also reasonable. But without Chevron, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read the statute, not only now but for all time, making it more difficult for a later administration to change its mind given new information or unforeseen conditions. Eliminating flexibility will not improve regulation. It will rigidify it and prevent the government from updating policy over time.",
            "BQAgency officials are more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges.",
            "Third, overturning Chevron is likely to inspire more litigation and instability in the lower courts. Releasing all federal judges from any obligation to defer to agencies will invite parties to challenge many more rules \u2014 not just the most significant ones \u2014 and relitigate thousands of interpretations that courts have already settled. Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised this concern at oral argument, when she suggested that a flood of litigation might ensue over long-standing interpretations, where courts already determined that Congress was not clear and deferred to agencies.",
            "Overturning Chevron will also undermine uniformity and consistency in the interpretation of federal law. Chevron is a familiar and useful tool for lower court judges \u2014 they understand and know how to use its framework. What might replace it? The most likely standard of review the Supreme Court would substitute is so-called Skidmore deference, which is the amount of deference an agency is due in the estimation of the reviewing court based on several considerations \u2014 a standard that provides lower courts little guidance and maximum flexibility. As Justice Elena Kagan said at oral argument, \u201cSkidmore has always meant nothing.\u201d Without Chevron, judges will wade into often unfamiliar and technically complex statutes armed with their dictionaries, textualist principles, and canons of construction. They may or may not give any respect to the agency\u2019s views. This situation cannot help but increase conflicts among the lower courts.",
            "*Haze_hangs_over_lower_Manhattan_last_July",
            "fCHaze hangs over lower Manhattan last July.\nGary Hershorn / Getty Images",
            "This prospect leads to a fourth and related point, which is that overturning Chevron is likely to be bad for business. Of course, many conservative opponents of regulation believe that Chevron enables more regulation on balance, so they would like to see it gone. But there is a decent possibility that the consequences for business will be, at best, mixed. A few high-profile politically controversial rules will always wind up in the Supreme Court. And for those, Chevron will hardly matter because the Court will simply decide, as it has shown a tendency to do. But overall, Chevron is a stabilizing force because of its effect on lower courts. Without Chevron\u2019s default presumption in favor of government, it will be more tempting for many would-be litigants \u2014 domestic and foreign companies, state attorneys general, public interest groups, other stakeholders \u2014 to challenge agency rules, even those that many, if not most, companies might be able to live with or which they might at least prefer to uncertainty. Unleashing a cacophony of inconsistent rulings on what various statutory provisions mean, issued by up to 850 federal judges with minimal expertise in technical areas undermines the stable conditions necessary for the private sector to thrive.",
            "The Supreme Court may not overturn Chevron after all, perhaps in part because of some of these considerations. It may limit its application to narrow circumstances or impose new threshold tests on when it can apply. But it is highly unlikely simply to reaffirm it, which would be the best outcome for democracy, good governance, and business. ",
            "At bottom, Chevron embodies an inclination \u2014 that federal agencies ought to be given the benefit of the doubt if they offer good reasons for interpreting a statute a particular way, when no one can say for sure what Congress would have wanted to do. That inclination depends on a belief that agency officials are both more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges, so that in such instances, agencies ought to be trusted to make the call. Coming to that conclusion requires judges to at least consider that there may be limits to their prowess and to allow that when it comes to complex regulatory statutes, where legal meaning and policy discretion are often intertwined, agencies can be legitimate legal interpreters. That attitude represents a certain faith in the capacity and competence of government that it would be a terrible shame to lose."
