            "This memory arises because the experience of obesity leads to changes in the epigenome \u2014 a set of chemical tags that can be added to or removed from cells\u2019 DNA and proteins that help to dial gene activity up or down. For fat cells, the shift in gene activity seems to render them incapable of their normal function. This impairment, as well as the changes in gene activity, can linger long after weight has dropped to healthy levels, a study published today in Nature reports.",
            "The results suggest that people trying to slim down will often require long-term care to avoid weight regain, says study co-author Laura Hinte, a biologist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. \u201cIt means that you need more help, potentially,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d",

            "To understand why weight can pile back on so quickly after it is lost, Hinte and her colleagues analysed fat tissue from a group of people with severe obesity, as well as from a control group of people who had never had obesity. They found that some genes were more active in the obesity group\u2019s fat cells than in the control group\u2019s fat cells, whereas other genes were less active.",

Two years after the participants with obesity had had weight-reduction operations, they had lost large amounts of weight \u2014 but their fat cells\u2019 genetic activity still displayed the obesity-linked pattern. The scientists found similar results in mice that had lost large amounts of weight.",
            "In the fat cells of both humans and mice, the genes dialled up during obesity are involved in spurring inflammation and fibrosis \u2014 the formation of stiff, scar-like tissue. The genes that are turned down help fat cells to function normally. Research on mice traced these shifts in gene activity to changes in the epigenome, which has a powerful effect on how active a gene is, including whether it is turned on at all.",
            "The scientists tested the durability of these changes by putting obese mice on a diet. A few months after the mice had become lean again, the changes in their epigenomes persisted, as if the cells \u2018remembered\u2019 being in a body with obesity.",

            "But scientists not involved in the study, including Roh, note that the paper doesn\u2019t prove that the epigenetic alterations caused the physical changes in the mice. The paper\u2019s list of epigenetic alterations in fat cells is valuable, says biologist Evan Rosen at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who studies fat tissue, but it will be difficult to determine which of those changes drive the fat cells\u2019 lingering memory.",

Sheena Josselyn, a neuroscientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, and her colleagues looked at whether stress disrupts engram formation and focused on a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is involved in stress and emotion response.",
            "The study involved an elaborate three-step experiment in mice. First, they put some adult mice in a stressed state by injecting them with the stress hormone corticosterone or restraining them in a small tube for 30 minutes, which increased their corticosterone levels.",
            "They then placed mice \u2014 some stressed, and others not \u2014 in a chamber and played a medium-pitched sound for 30 seconds, a neutral event. After a break, the mice went back into the chamber and experienced a high-pitched whistling sound for 30 seconds, which ended with a 2-second shock to the foot, to mimic a fearful event.",
            "To test how the mice had stored the memories of these experiences, the researchers put the mice in a new environment and played the two tones \u2014 watching for how they responded. ",
            "The unstressed mice froze mostly when they heard the high-pitched whistling, whereas the stressed mice froze in response to both sounds, suggesting that they couldn\u2019t distinguish between the neutral and fearful events. ",
            "h2Exclusive club",
            "The researchers used various techniques to visualize neural activity in the rodents. They found that, during memory formation, the unstressed mice formed small engrams in response to the whistle and foot shock, and these were only reactivated when exposed to the whistle. But the stressed mice formed larger engrams, which were reactivated when exposed to both sounds. ",
            "Further experiments uncovered the chain of events in the brain that created the larger engram in stressed mice. Under normal conditions, specific neurons in the amygdala block neuronal activity through the release of chemical messengers known as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This ensures that a small engram is created in response to a negative memory. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the velvet rope at a nightclub: it only lets certain neurons into the nightclub,\u201d says Josselyn. But under stress, excitatory neurons pump the brain with a neurotransmitter known as endocannabinoid, which binds to glucocorticoid receptors on those inhibitory neurons and prevents them from releasing GABA, resulting in larger engrams. In other words, the velvet rope drops, \u201cand many neurons can get into this exclusive club\u201d, says Josselyn.",
            "The team were able to reverse the effects of stress on memory formation with two drugs, one of which is approved for terminating early pregnancy, mifepristone. The drugs either block the glucocorticoid receptors or the production of endocannabinoids, and the stressed mice recalled memories in the way that unstressed mice did. But researchers caution that the medications have side effects beyond the brain, and work only if they are given at the time the memory is formed, so are unlikely to be useful in people.",
            "Josselyn and her colleagues are now trying to investigate whether engrams can be altered after a memory has formed, or whether there are other ways of mitigating the effects of stress on memory.",

High temperatures tend to be found closest to the surface in regions with active volcanism, or where the continental crust is thinner than average.

For treating \u2018uncomplicated\u2019, or non-severe, cases of malaria, the World Health Organization recommends a course of pills containing an artemisinin derivative, which rapidly eliminates most malaria parasites in the body, combined with a \u2018partner\u2019 drug that circulates in the body for longer and kills the remaining parasites. These regimens are called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).",

This term refers to a delay in the clearance of the malaria parasite from the body after treatment; a partially resistant infection is classified as one in which the drug takes longer than 5 hours to kill half of the malaria parasites.",
            "How to defuse malaria\u2019s ticking time bomb",
            "In the past, researchers have connected specific mutations in P. falciparum proteins with the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance2 \u2014 meaning that the parasites are evolving to evade the \u2018gold standard\u2019 malaria treatment. John and colleagues analysed the genomes of the parasites infecting children in their study, and found that ten participants had one of two types of these mutations. One of the mutations, detected in eight participants, was associated with artemisinin taking longer than usual to clear the parasite.",
            "Another group of ten children in the study had a malaria infection that recurred after their treatment concluded. These cases were not attributable to the presence of any known artemisinin-resistance mutations. Instead, John thinks the recurrence might have been caused by resistance to lumefantrine, a partner drug administered orally in the ACT step of the treatment regimen for severe malaria. But more studies are needed to evaluate that possibility, John says. \u201cWhat the recurrence suggests to us is that maybe that partner drug is not working as well as it should, because the parasites are coming back,\u201d he adds.",
            "Since resistance to artemisinin was first identified in southeast Asia in the 2000s, scientists\u2019 biggest concern has been how it will affect the treatment of severe cases of malaria, says Philip Rosenthal, a malaria specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cEven if the drug still works, that slower action could make a difference and lead to higher levels of mortality,\u201d he says.",
            "But the study by John and his colleagues doesn\u2019t provide a definitive answer to whether artemisinin resistance is already leading to worse clinical outcomes, Rosenthal notes. The study size was too small, and all the children analysed eventually recovered, even if this process sometimes took longer than expected. That just shows that current treatments for severe malaria aren\u2019t \u201cquite as good as we might have hoped\u201d, he says.",
            "Rosenthal and others are still worried about this news, however. \u201cThe emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa is a major threat to malaria control,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are now only starting to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d ",

Even if researchers had already produced all the information needed to understand a human cell or a brain, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we would know it\u201d, he says, \u201cbecause no human has the ability to understand or read all the literature and get a comprehensive view.\u201d",
            "Five years later, Rodriques says he is closer to solving that problem using artificial intelligence (AI). In September, he and his team at the US start-up FutureHouse announced that an AI-based system they had built could, within minutes, produce syntheses of scientific knowledge that were more accurate than Wikipedia pages1. The team promptly generated Wikipedia-style entries on around 17,000 human genes, most of which previously lacked a detailed page.",
            "How AI-powered science search engines can speed up your research",
            "Rodriques is not the only one turning to AI to help synthesize science. For decades, scholars have been trying to accelerate the onerous task of compiling bodies of research into reviews. \u201cThey\u2019re too long, they\u2019re incredibly intensive and they\u2019re often out of date by the time they\u2019re written,\u201d says Iain Marshall, who studies research synthesis at King\u2019s College London. The explosion of interest in large language models (LLMs), the generative-AI programs that underlie tools such as ChatGPT, is prompting fresh excitement about automating the task.",
            "Some of the newer AI-powered science search engines can already help people to produce narrative literature reviews \u2014 a written tour of studies \u2014 by finding, sorting and summarizing publications. But they can\u2019t yet produce a high-quality review by themselves. The toughest challenge of all is the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 systematic review, which involves stringent procedures to search and assess papers, and often a meta-analysis to synthesize the results. Most researchers agree that these are a long way from being fully automated. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll eventually get there,\u201d says Paul Glasziou, a specialist in evidence and systematic reviews at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia. \u201cI just can\u2019t tell you whether that\u2019s 10 years away or 100 years away.\u201d",
            "At the same time, however, researchers fear that AI tools could lead to more sloppy, inaccurate or misleading reviews polluting the literature. \u201cThe worry is that all the decades of research on how to do good evidence synthesis starts to be undermined,\u201d says James Thomas, who studies evidence synthesis at University College London.",
            "h2Computer-assisted reviews",
            "Computer software has been helping researchers to search and parse the research literature for decades. Well before LLMs emerged, scientists were using machine-learning and other algorithms to help to identify particular studies or to quickly pull findings out of papers. But the advent of systems such as ChatGPT has triggered a frenzy of interest in speeding up this process by combining LLMs with other software.",
            "AI science search engines are exploding in number \u2014 are they any good? ",
            "It would be terribly naive to ask ChatGPT \u2014 or any other AI chatbot \u2014 to simply write an academic literature review from scratch, researchers say. These LLMs generate text by training on enormous amounts of writing, but most commercial AI firms do not reveal what data the models were trained on. If asked to review research on a topic, an LLM such as ChatGPT is likely to draw on credible academic research, inaccurate blogs and who knows what other information, says Marshall. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no weighing up of what the most pertinent, high-quality literature is,\u201d he says. And because LLMs work by repeatedly generating statistically plausible words in response to a query, they produce different answers to the same question and \u2018hallucinate\u2019 errors \u2014 including, notoriously, non-existent academic references. \u201cNone of the processes which are regarded as good practice in research synthesis take place,\u201d Marshall says.",
            "A more sophisticated process involves uploading a corpus of pre-selected papers to an LLM, and asking it to extract insights from them, basing its answer only on those studies. This \u2018retrieval-augmented generation\u2019 seems to cut down on hallucinations, although it does not prevent them. The process can also be set up so that the LLM will reference the sources it drew its information from.",
            "This is the basis for specialized, AI-powered science search engines such as Consensus and Elicit. Most companies do not reveal exact details of how their systems work. But they typically turn a user\u2019s question into a computerized search across academic databases such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed, returning the most relevant results.",
            "An LLM then summarizes each of these studies and synthesizes them into an answer that cites its sources; the user is given various options to filter the work they want to include. \u201cThey are search engines first and foremost,\u201d says Aaron Tay, who heads data services at Singapore Management University and blogs about AI tools. \u201cAt the very least, what they cite is definitely real.\u201d",

Bilal notes that much of the research literature is paywalled and it\u2019s computationally intensive to search a lot of full text. \u201cRunning an AI app through the whole text of millions of articles will take a lot of time, and it will become prohibitively expensive,\u201d he says.",

In part because PaperQA2 digests the full text of papers, running it is expensive, he says.",

            "A systematic review involves at least 25 careful steps, according to a breakdown from Glasziou\u2019s team. After combing through the literature, a researcher must filter their longlist to find the most pertinent papers, then extract data, screen studies for potential bias and synthesize the results. (Many of these steps are done in duplicate by another researcher to check for inconsistencies.) This laborious method \u2014 which is supposed to be rigorous, transparent and reproducible \u2014 is considered worthwhile in medicine, for instance, because clinicians use the results to guide important decisions about treating patients.",
            " ChatGPT-like AIs are coming to major science search engines",
            "In 2019, before ChatGPT came along, Glasziou and his colleagues set out to achieve a world record in science: a systematic review in two weeks. He and others, including Marshall and Thomas, had already developed computer tools to reduce the time involved. The menu of software available by that time included RobotSearch, a machine-learning model trained to quickly identify randomized trials from a collection of studies. RobotReviewer, another AI system, helps to assess whether a study is at risk of bias because it was not adequately blinded, for instance. \u201cAll of those are important little tools in shaving down the time of doing a systematic review,\u201d Glasziou says.",
            "The clock started at 9:30 a.m. on Monday 21 January 2019. The team cruised across the line at lunchtime on Friday 1 February, after a total of nine working days3. \u201cI was excited,\u201d says epidemiologist Anna Mae Scott at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the study while at Bond University; everyone celebrated with cake. Since then, the team has pared its record down to five days.",
            "Could the process get faster? Other researchers have been working to automate aspects of systematic reviews, too. In 2015, Glasziou founded the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews, a niche community that, fittingly, has produced several systematic reviews about tools for automating systematic reviews4. But even so, \u201cnot very many [tools] have seen widespread acceptance\u201d, says Marshall. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how mature the technology is.\u201d",
            "Elicit is one company that says its tool helps researchers with systematic reviews, not just narrative ones. The firm does not offer systematic reviews at the push of a button, says Brady, but its system does automate some of the steps \u2014 including screening papers and extracting data and insights. Brady says that most researchers who use it for systematic reviews have uploaded relevant papers they find using other search techniques.",
            "Systematic-review aficionados worry that AI tools are at risk of failing to meet two essential criteria of the studies: transparency and reproducibility. \u201cIf I can\u2019t see the methods used, then it is not a systematic review, it is simply a review article,\u201d says Justin Clark, who builds review automation tools as part of Glasziou\u2019s team. Brady says that the papers that reviewers upload to Elicit \u201care an excellent, transparent record\u201d of their starting literature. As for reproducibility: \u201cWe don\u2019t guarantee that our results are always going to be identical across repeats of the same steps, but we aim to make it so \u2014 within reason,\u201d he says, adding that transparency and reproducibility will be important as the firm improves its system.",
            "Specialists in reviewing say they would like to see more published evaluations of the accuracy and reproducibility of AI systems that have been designed to help produce literature reviews. \u201cBuilding cool tools and trying stuff out is really good fun,\u201d says Clark. \u201cDoing a hardcore evaluative study is a lot of hard work.\u201d",
            "Audit AI search tools now, before they skew research",
            "Earlier this year, Clark led a systematic review of studies that had used generative AI tools to help with systematic reviewing. He and his team found only 15 published studies in which the AI\u2019s performance had been adequately compared with that of a person. The results, which have not yet been published or peer reviewed, suggest that these AI systems can extract some data from uploaded studies and assess the risk of bias of clinical trials. \u201cIt seems to do OK with reading and assessing papers,\u201d Clark says, \u201cbut it did very badly at all these other tasks\u201d, including designing and conducting a thorough literature search. (Existing computer software can already do the final step of synthesizing data using a meta-analysis.)",
            "Glasziou and his team are still trying to shave time off their reviewing record through improved tools, which are available on a website they call the Evidence Review Accelerator. \u201cIt won\u2019t be one big thing. It\u2019s that every year you\u2019ll get faster and faster,\u201d Glasziou predicts. In 2022, for instance, the group released a computerized tool called Methods Wizard, which asks users a series of questions about their methods and then writes a protocol for them without using AI.",
            "h2Rushed reviews?",
            "Automating the synthesis of information also comes with risks. Researchers have known for years that many systematic reviews are redundant or of poor quality5, and AI could make these problems worse. Authors might knowingly or unknowingly use AI tools to race through a review that does not follow rigorous procedures, or which includes poor-quality work, and get a misleading result.",
            "By contrast, says Glasziou, AI could also encourage researchers to do a quick check of previously published literature when they wouldn\u2019t have bothered before. \u201cAI may raise their game,\u201d he says. And Brady says that, in future, AI tools could help to flag and filter out poor-quality papers by looking for telltale signs such as P-hacking, a form of data manipulation.",
            "Glasziou sees the situation as a balance of two forces: AI tools could help scientists to produce high-quality reviews, but might also fuel the rapid generation of substandard ones. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the net impact is going to be on the published literature,\u201d he says.",
            "Some people argue that the ability to synthesize and make sense of the world\u2019s knowledge should not lie solely in the hands of opaque, profit-making companies. Clark wants to see non-profit groups build and carefully test AI tools. He and other researchers welcomed the announcement from two UK funders last month that they are investing more than US$70 million in evidence-synthesis systems. \u201cWe just want to be cautious and careful,\u201d Clark says. \u201cWe want to make sure that the answers that [technology] is helping to provide to us are correct.\u201d",

            "To address this problem, Zhang and his colleagues compared the genomes of cultivated tomato species (Solanum lycopersicum) with their much-sweeter wild counterparts.

Using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene-editing technology, the researchers deactivated the two genes and found that the plants bore fruit that was much sweeter than that of a widely cultivated variety.",

But the timing of the Pew survey means it could be used as a benchmark for tracking attitudes towards science during Trump\u2019s second term, he says.",
            "h2Partisan split",
            "Tyson and his colleagues polled 9,593 US residents using online and phone surveys between 21 and 27 October. Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with statements about scientists\u2019 intelligence, communication skills, compassion for the public and engagement in policy.",
            "Almost 90% of survey respondents who identified themselves as Democrats indicated a belief that scientists act in the public\u2019s best interest. The figure for Republicans was 66% \u2014 5 percentage points higher than last year. But respondents were sharply divided over whether scientists should engage in policy debates on scientific issues, with 51% supporting an active role and 48% saying scientists should stay out of these debates.",
            "How can scientists make the most of the public\u2019s trust in them?",
            "This means that \u201cpeople want to trust the science but are not always sure they can trust the scientists\u201d to put personal biases aside when using their influence, says Arthur Lupia, a survey researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.",
            "The Pew report also found that only 45% of respondents think scientists are good communicators and 47% think scientists feel superior to others. Researchers who spoke to Nature say that the scientific community should accept that feedback, and act on it.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to discover something \u2014 it\u2019s another thing to explain it effectively,\u201d Lupia says. \u201cFor science to have public value, we actually have to do both of those things.\u201d",
            "To solve the communication conundrum, Oreskes says that scientific degree programmes should add more public-focused writing and speaking to their curricula. Mede suggests that scientists attend children\u2019s school science fairs, help with community-science projects and find other ways to speak to people face-to-face.",
            "\u201cThere is an important opportunity here for scientists, particularly those in government agencies,\u201d says Oreskes, \u201cto do an honest review of the ways in which their communications fell short during the pandemic, and consider how they can do better going forward.\u201d",

Such crowdsourced signals could improve satellite navigation, especially in swathes of the world where data are otherwise scarce, including Africa, South America and South Asia.",
            "The proof-of-principle study, by a team at Google, was published in Nature on 13 November1.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing data set,\u201d says Anthea Coster, an atmospheric physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. \u201cIt fills in the map a lot, in areas where we desperately need more information.\u201d",
            "Phone data could reduce GPS errors by 10\u201320% in some areas, and more in underserved regions, estimates Ningbo Wang, an atmospheric physicist at the Aerospace Information Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Even with adjustments, interference from the ionosphere remains a challenge, he says, especially during solar storms that trigger uneven conditions in the ionosphere. \u201cThe results presented are truly impressive.\u201d",
            "h2Dual bands",
            "When the air is partly ionized, freely moving electrons slightly slow down the radio signals travelling to Earth from GPS and other navigation satellites. This can affect the nanosecond-precision timing that satellite navigation devices use to pinpoint their locations, with potentially serious impacts on aeroplane landings and autonomous vehicles.",
            "Real-time maps of the density of these electrons are commonly used to correct for fluctuations in the ionosphere. Engineers create the maps using data from ground-based receiver stations, which can detect the arrival times of two different frequencies of radio waves received from the same satellite. Electrons in the ionosphere slow down low-frequency waves more than they do high-frequency ones, by a nanosecond or so. This difference reveals the density of the electrons the wave passed through on its way to a receiver.",
            "Without these corrections, GPS would be out by around 5 metres, and by tens of metres during solar storms, when charged particles from the Sun can boost electron density. But many regions of the world lack the ground-based receiver stations used to make these maps.",
            "h2Noisy bonanza",
            "Although not all satnav devices can work at multiple frequencies, modern phones often do. Phone sensors also weren\u2019t previously thought to be viable for mapping the ionosphere, says Brian Williams, a computer scientist at Google in Mountain View, California, and a co-author of the study. This is because data from mobile phones are much noisier than are those from purpose-built scientific receivers, not least because they receive signals only intermittently and because the radio waves bounce off nearby buildings in built-up areas.",
            "The Google team succeeded in part thanks to the volume of data obtained. \u201cWhen combined in large numbers, the noise averages out and you still get a clear signal,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s like there is a scientific monitoring station in every city where there are phones.\u201d",
            "Anyone with an Android phone \u2014 and who allows Google to collect sensor data to improve location accuracy \u2014 was eligible to contribute to the study. But the data were aggregated such that individual devices are not identifiable, says the firm.",
            "Williams says that efforts are already under way to use this technique to improve location accuracy for Android users. But the data should also be useful for scientific studies of Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, he says. Already, the map has revealed bubbles in ionized gas, known as plasma, over South America that had not previously been observed in detail.",
            "For science to really benefit, Google will need to release the data, says Coster, who works on the Madrigal Database, a community resource for geospacer data that brings together ionosphere data from thousands of ground stations. A spokesperson for Google told Nature\u2019s news team that the data behind the study will be released alongside the paper, but there are currently no plans to provide fresh data in real time.",
            "Researchers are working on using other smartphone sensors in other ways. Google\u2019s Android Earthquake Alerts System in 2020 showed how accelerometers in people\u2019s phones could sense quakes and warn others who were yet to be hit. Apple users can access an app that uses similar technology. ",
            "Until now, scientists have thought of phones as end users of navigation services, says Wang. Flipping this on its head to use phone measurements as input data is \u201cnew territory\u201d, he says. \u201cThis paper marks an exciting shift.\u201d",

            "Dandruff makes the scalp itch, but it\u2019s not a dry skin problem. Treating it may call for a change in how often you wash your hair, use of an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo, or even turning to a prescription shampoo. ",
            "Dandruff flakes on your hair or shoulders don\u2019t look good. The itchy scalp that comes with it is no fun, either. In fact, although dandruff shows up on your hair, the condition actually starts with your scalp.",
            "Dandruff is a type of dermatitis (Der-muh-TY-tis), or skin inflammation. One study estimated that half of us will at some point develop this condition. And one key time it may emerge is puberty.",
            "Everyone\u2019s scalp hosts a mix of microbes. This is known as its microbiome (MY-kroh-BY-ohm). Sometimes the normal proportion of some types to others gets messed up. This is known as a dysbiosis (Dis-by-OH-sis). In people with dandruff, certain types of yeast and bacteria are far more common, compared to people with healthy scalps.",
            "Amy McMichael\u00a0and others discussed some of the culprits in a July 2024 report in the Archives of Dermatological Research. She\u2019s a dermatologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Both are in Winston-Salem, N.C.",
            "People often make the mistake of thinking an itchy, scaly scalp is dry, McMichael says. If they add oil, though, they risk making matters worse. Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",
            "Hair-care practices might explain some of the difference, McMichael says. She and others have found differences in how often women of African and European ancestry shampoo their hair. Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",
            "And also use hair conditioners, McMichael advises. \u201cIt actually smooths the outer layer \u2014 the cuticle \u2014 much better than you can get with oil.\u201d Be careful about using hair sprays and gels, she adds. These can dry hair, increasing the risk that strands will break.",
            "In any case, if you notice a hair or scalp problem, talk to your doctor or another health-care expert right away. You might need help for dandruff. Or you might have a more serious skin or hair condition.",
            "\u201cThe earlier that you come in, the better off you are,\u201d McMichael says."

            "A sounding rocket called Endurance is shown launching from Svalbard, Norway in May 2022. Tools on board it were at last able to measure the faint but powerful electric field in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
            "For the first time, scientists have measured a long-sought global electric field in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This ambipolar electric field had been predicted to exist decades ago. But it had never been detected \u2014 until now.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s the big whoop,\u201d says Glyn Collinson. He works at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. An atmospheric scientist, he was lead investigator for the Endurance rocket program. And what it\u2019s just detected, he says, is \u201ca whole frickin\u2019 new planetary-energy field that\u2019s never been measured before!\u201d",
            "The field is weak. At only 0.55 volt, it\u2019s about as strong as a watch battery, Collinson says. Still, that\u2019s strong enough to control the shape and evolution of Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. And the features it controls, he says, could affect the suitability of our planet for life.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to the DNA of our planet,\u201d Collinson says of this field. He led a team that confirmed its presence in the August 28 Nature.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/UCM1MaYC5lM?feature=oembed",
            "Learn more about this newfound third major \u201cfield\u201d that not only shapes the environment of our planet but also helps make it habitable. Though very weak, this electric field can still lift the atmosphere up and allow for a hitherto mysterious up-flowing polar wind.",
            "Scientists first predicted such an electric field in the 1960s. This was at the dawn of the space age. Early spacecraft flying over Earth\u2019s poles detected a supersonic outflow of ions \u2014 charged particles \u2014 exiting the atmosphere. They called it a polar wind.",
            "The most reasonable thing to explain that speedy wind would be some electric field. How? Sunlight might kick electrons out of atoms in the upper atmosphere. Those negatively charged electrons are energetic and light enough that they want to float out into space. Left behind are positively charged oxygen ions. Being heavier, they want to sink down in Earth\u2019s gravity.",
            "But the atmosphere wants to remain electrically neutral \u2014 neither positive nor negative \u2014 by keeping an equal balance between electrons and positive ions. So this electric field forms. It keeps the electrons tied to the ions, which prevents them from escaping.",
            "Once established, the field can act as a booster for lighter ions, such as hydrogen. It gives them enough energy to break free of Earth\u2019s gravity. Now they zoom away, forming that polar wind. The field also pulls heavier ions higher up into the atmosphere than they would otherwise reach. Here, other forces can propel them, too, into space.",
            "That was the hypothesis, anyway. But until very recently, technology to detect that field didn\u2019t exist.",
            "Being such a weak field, Collinson says, finding it \u201cwas genuinely thought impossible.\u201d",

            "He and his team had to develop a new instrument to measure it. They mounted this photoelectron spectrometer onto a rocket. They called the rocket Endurance. They named it for the ship that Ernest Shackleton\u2019s team took to explore Antarctica in 1914.",

            "Glyn Collinson checks his team\u2019s new photoelectron spectrometer as the rocket that will launch it is being assembled in Svalbard, Norway. The device detected a weak electric field, which develops in the atmosphere above Earth\u2019s poles. ",
            "Getting to the launchpad was a journey worthy of the rocket\u2019s name. They had to be as far into the polar region as possible. So the team traveled by boat for 17 hours to get to a Norwegian archipelago. Known as Svalbard, it\u2019s just 1,300 kilometers (815 miles) from the North Pole.",
            "Along the way, several members of the team got sick with COVID-19. Adding to tensions, the war between nearby Russia and Ukraine had begun just a few months earlier.",
            "So that explains \u201ca certain amount of nervousness about firing off rockets,\u201d Collinson recalls. \u201cPolar bears were the least of it. We had war and plague.\u201d",
            "Two more days of blizzards kept Endurance grounded. When the rocket finally launched on May 11, 2022, it went straight up through the atmosphere to a height of around 770 kilometers (480 miles). Along the way, it measured the energies of electrons every 10 seconds. The flight lasted 19 minutes. Afterward, the rocket fell back to Earth, splashing down in the Greenland Sea.",
            "Between 248 and 768 kilometers up, Endurance detected a change in the electric potential of 0.55 volt. That\u2019s not much. But it was exactly enough to explain the polar wind.",
            "The measurement is solid and exciting, says David Brain. A planetary scientist, he works at the University of Colorado Boulder and did not take part in the new work. He also cautions that it\u2019s only one data point and from just one rocket. \u201cThis result is a really great result,\u201d he says, but one that \u201cargues there should be more measurements like this.\u201d",
            "Collinson agrees. NASA recently approved his team to launch a follow-up rocket. It will be named Resolute for an Arctic-exploring ship that set sail in 1850.",
            "The ambipolar electric field helps control how quickly a planet\u2019s atmosphere escapes into space. As such, it likely plays some role in making a planet hospitable to life, Collinson says.",

            "Like Earth, the Venusian atmosphere has an electric field. But it\u2019s far stronger than Earth\u2019s and led to a far different evolution of its climate, as this animation explains.",
            "Both Mars and Venus also have electric fields. But in their cases, they might have fared better over time without them.",
            "For instance, Mars used to be more like Earth, scientists think. Over time, it lost much of its atmosphere to space. Indeed, that atmospheric \u201closs to space was a significant, if not dominant, process in changing [Mars\u2019] climate,\u201d Bruce Jakosky told Science News back in 2015. Jakosky, who works at the University of Colorado Boulder, led a team that measured that loss. And Venus used to be much wetter, data suggest.",
            "If such an electric field didn\u2019t exist on Venus and Mars, \u201cthen I think it\u2019s possible Venus and Mars would have lost less oxygen,\u201d Brain says \u2014 and therefore less water.",
            "Earth\u2019s ambipolar electric field helps kick its oxygen out into space, too. But Earth has one key advantage over Mars and Venus: It has a global magnetic field to guide charged particles around the planet.",
            "*an_infographic_text_on_the_image_reads",
            "fCWithin the solar system, Venus appears to have started out as Earth\u2019s twin. But owing to a very different electric-field strength, Venus lost most water from its surface and atmosphere. Today, Venus is a very hot, dry place, while our planet is a relatively comfortable site teeming with life.",
            "\u201cThe electric field is the engine that gets the particles moving,\u201d Brain explains. \u201cThe magnetic field is sort of the road that the particles move along.\u201d Earth\u2019s magnetic field means oxygen can escape only near the poles, rather than from any or all parts of the atmosphere.",
            "And that, he adds, could help explain why Earth has kept its habitable atmosphere for so much longer than Venus or Mars.\u00a0",
            "\u201cFundamentally, what makes a planet habitable is going to be many things,\u201d Collinson says. \u201cBut I think comparing these different energy fields across different planets is a way to answer the question: Why is the Earth habitable?\u201d In other words, \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d",

These blobs lurk under the Pacific Ocean and Africa. Scientists now think these blobs could be what\u2019s left of Theia, entombed in the Earth\u2019s lower mantle.",

Plate tectonics explains why and how Earth\u2019s crust changes over time. No other rocky planet in our solar system appears to have this feature.",

            "Craters are round, bowl-shaped depressions surrounded by a ring, like the one shown in Figure 1. They are made when a\u00a0meteorite\u00a0collides with a\u00a0planet\u00a0or a\u00a0moon. Craters are what make our moon look like Swiss cheese. Each round hole is the place where a meteorite\u00a0impacted, or hit, the surface of the moon, so craters are often called\u00a0impact craters. Often, the meteorite that creates a crater explodes on impact, so the crater is an empty reminder of the collision.",
            "There are\u00a0meteoroids\u00a0traveling around throughout space, and all of the moons and planets in our solar system have been impacted by meteorites since its formation. (Note: they are called meteoroids when they\u2019re still in space, and meteorites when they land on a planet or moon.)",
            "On Earth, we only see a few impact craters, for a couple of different reasons. First, most meteoroids never reach the Earth\u2019s surface because they burn up in the atmosphere. This is what we are seeing when we watch a\u00a0shooting star\u00a0during a\u00a0meteor shower\u00a0(meteor\u00a0refers to the visible streak of light). Second, impact craters from meteorites can be changed by geological forces (like earthquakes and continental movements) or eroded away by atmospheric forces (like wind or rain). There is no atmosphere on the moon, which means that falling meteoroids do not burn up and there is no weather to erode away the craters. In fact, the footprints of the astronauts who landed on the moon over 50 years ago are still there!",

            "Where can you find impact craters on Earth? There are only about 170 confirmed impact craters on Earth. Not all of them are obvious because most are eroded, covered by sediment or under water. Each crater has to be identified using several different kinds of clues. First, geological clues are found by looking for pieces of the exploded, iron-rich meteorite or for glass that formed during the impact. Satellite imaging can be used to visualize crater formations that are beneath the Earth\u2019s surface or a body of water. Finally, chemical evidence is used to date the crater and find traces of elements that are more common in space than on our planet.",
            "By piecing together this evidence, scientists can study craters on Earth and link them to different periods of Earth\u2019s history. This involves many different types of scientists, including astronomers, geologists, chemists, paleontologists and meteorologists (who actually study weather, not meteorites). This has led to an interesting hypothesis being proposed about the formation of a sea, the extinction of the dinosaurs and even the origins of life!",
            "In this science project, you will investigate whether the size of a crater depends upon the size of the meteorite. To test this, you will use different-sized, nearly spherical objects as your \u201cmeteorites,\u201d like the objects shown in Figure 2. What types of clues will you look for in your investigation? How will studying an impact crater give you information about the collision, even if the meteorite is no longer there? Are there other clues of a meteorite impact that are important?",

            "A full moon could make it easy for a werewolf to spot prey. But a bright night makes it easy to be spotted, too. ",
            "As the full moon rises, a mythical werewolf howls and heads out on the hunt. But is this the best time for werewolves to find a meal? In some stories, this transformation can happen at any time of the month or even during the day. And science suggests that a careful werewolf might want to schedule their change based on their goals.\u00a0",
            "The moon affects our world in several ways. As it orbits Earth, the moon pushes and pulls at the oceans to make tides. These tides can, in turn, influence the behavior of ocean creatures. And moonlight \u2014 a reflection of the sun \u2014 can also have power over the behavior of animals both on land and in the sea.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "If a werewolf is all big, scary predator, the full moon might be a blessing. But if the animal could face predators itself, it might want to save its transformation for a much darker night.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The dark depths of an ocean or stream might not seem like the obvious place for animals affected by the moon. But \u201cit is something that we see pretty commonly among aquatic critters,\u201d says Heidi Ballew. She\u2019s a marine ecologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ballew studies the \u2018O\u2018opu nakea (Awaous stamineus), a goby native to Hawaii. The hardy little fish are born in freshwater streams in the hills. From there, a goby\u2019s life can take two very different paths depending on when it\u2019s born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When the moon is full, the sun, Earth and moon are lined up. This produces higher tides. Some gobies hatch during that full moon. The higher tides sweep their tiny bodies out to sea. When they are grown, higher tides during the new moon (when the sun, moon and Earth line up again) help them find their way back to their home streams. Special fins on their bellies, modified into suckers, help them climb waterfalls back to their birthplace. There, they mate and make more gobies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/mmwM7dwtvKA?feature=oembed",
            "Waterfall? Not a problem. Watch a goby climb up a waterfall with her mouth and her sucker-like fin.\u00a0",
            "But not all gobies go out to see the world. Gobies born during the dark of a new moon stay home and never leave the stream where they are born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Baby gobies are trying to avoid predation, Ballew says. \u201cA full moon provides a high tide. But it also produces a lot of light \u2014 even underwater.\u201d Night-hunting fish can better see tiny, defenseless gobies. So if a fish is going to stay put, hatching at the new moon is a safer bet.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The moon matters even as they grow into adults. A big, well-fed baby goby may become an adult during the full moon. But a smaller goby might become an adult at the new moon instead. The darkness hides these still-small, newly adult gobies, keeping them safe from predators. Ballew and her colleagues published their fishy findings February 26 in the journal Ecology of Freshwater Fish.\u00a0",
            "So there are pros and cons to lots of moonlight. A full moon lights up the night and makes it easy to spot dinner. But if a werewolf is as likely to become prey as it is to go hunting, a new moon might help it hide.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The bright night of a full moon also presents Australian mammals with a problem, says Euan Ritchie. He\u2019s a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In one study, Ritchie and his colleagues took photos of animals in southeastern Australia at different phases of the moon. Prey species such as possums and rabbit-sized bandicoots were more active when nights were cloudy. The extra darkness provided cover to hide from predators.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But predators such as quolls were also more active when it was darker \u2014 when the moon was new or half. Each species was trying to find a balance between getting more food and becoming someone else\u2019s dinner.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "\u201cPredators often use ambush to capture their prey,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cThe lighter it is, the harder it might be [for predators] to avoid detection.\u201d While the prey might be able to spot a predator more easily, they, too, may be more detectable. \u201cThey [might] be more hesitant to be active, especially in areas without much cover to retreat to.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ritchie and his colleagues published their findings in 2020 in the journal Australian Mammalogy.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Werewolves also need to find that balance between predator and prey. If a werewolf wanted to hunt as much as possible, \u201cthey would hunt humans by day and night,\u201d Ritchie says. But being a werewolf isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cMany prey, including humans, are often far from harmless.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In that case, Ballew says, a werewolf might be advised to vary its strategy. A big, strong werewolf could find good hunting during the full moon. But if a werewolf is small, young, or weak? \u201cMaybe you would want to utilize the new moon so that your predators are less likely to find you.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson a werewolf could learn from the gobies that stayed home.\u00a0\u00a0"

Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",

            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",

            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",

            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",

But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

She works at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.",
            "Nicknamed Percy, the rover turned up this potential sign of life in mid-July. The robot had drilled into a reddish rock at a site known as Cheyava Falls.

On Earth, they\u2019re the building blocks of life.",

But since Percy\u00a0landed in Jezero Crater three years ago, scientists have struggled to identify organics, Stack Morgan says. That landing site was an ancient, dried-up lake.",
            "Adding to the new excitement, little white spots with black rims speckle the reddish rock sample that Percy found. \u201cThey look like a tricolored leopard spot,\u201d Stack Morgan says.",
            "Percy examined these spots using instruments that can identify the chemical recipe of materials. And the spots\u2019 rims contained iron phosphate. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry have been linked to ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create such rings can be an energy source for microbes.",

He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed.

Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",

            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

A human still has to review that text, however. Her role: looking for missed details, such as spelling errors or words the program just got wrong. Similarly, computers could compile lists of suspect articles for people to check, Kasprak says. Here, people would then be asked to offer the final assessment of what reads true.",
            "Even as computers get better at flagging bogus stories, there\u2019s no guarantee that fake news creators won\u2019t step up their game to stay just ahead of the truth cops.

The system then considered several factors to judge how truthful the posts were likely to be. If, for example, the story centered on a local event, the user\u2019s input was seen as more credible than a comment from someone far away. The computer also judged as suspicious the frequent tweets on a story by someone who had not tweeted for a long time. It used other factors, too, to sift through tweets.",

The researchers reviewed reposted stories and the networks of readers that they involved for some 1,700 fake and 500 true news stories on Weibo. They did the same for about 30 fake and 30 true news networks on Twitter. On both social-media sites, Li\u2019s team found, most people tend to repost real news straight from a single source. The same was not true for fake news. These stories tended to spread more through people reposting from other reposters.",

He\u2019s a data analyst at SSON Analytics in Singapore.",
            "Internet sites could put warning signs on stories they suspect of being untrue. But labeling such stories may have an unfortunate effect. It may cause people to think that the remaining unlabeled stories are all true. In fact, they may simply have not been reviewed by a fact-checker. This was the conclusion, anyway, of research posted last year on the Social Science Research Network. Gordon Pennycook in Canada at the University of Regina, and David Rand of Yale University in New Haven, Conn., conducted the study.",
            "Facebook has taken a different approach. It shows debunked stories lower in a user\u2019s news feeds. And that can cut a false article\u2019s future views by as much as 80 percent, company spokesperson Svensson says. Facebook also displays articles that debunk false stories whenever users encounter the related stories. That technique, however, may backfire. Zollo in Venice, Italy, works with Walter Quattrociocchi. They conducted a study of Facebook users who like and share conspiracy news. And after these readers interacted with debunking articles, they actually increased their activity on Facebook\u2019s conspiracy pages, they reported this past June.",

Are you reading a news story on the front page of a newspaper? Then it\u2019s trying to inform you. Is it a column on the editorial page? A newspaper\u2019s editorial page is where writers share opinions, so a story here is trying to persuade you.",

Is the photo related to the news story it\u2019s attached to? Why is it there? What was the photographer trying to communicate? What angle was the photo taken from? (When a photographer is shooting down on a subject, it tends to make the subject appear powerless, Baker says. When the camera is looking up at the person, they appear powerful.)",

If you\u2019re questioning something a politician said, she suggests searching for a few key words on FactCheck.org. If you\u2019re wondering about a meme or a story shared via social media, try Snopes. If you suspect a photo might have been manipulated, or might not show what its caption claims, do a reverse image search. This will show you where the image has appeared before.

They\u2019d put their feet in the air and cry, \u201cOur feet are hot!\u201d Their games had been played on artificial turf. This heat-trapping plastic can get so hot it burns. A new water-storage system that Cirkel\u2019s Dutch research team has just developed works to avoid that problem.",

Eventually, that water will evaporate. As it does, it will cool the playing surface. It\u2019s like the way sweating works. There, the body releases moisture to carry heat away from our skin.",

One hot June day, the surface of regular artificial grass soared to 62.2\u00b0 Celsius\u00a0(144\u00b0 Fahrenheit)! That was 25 degrees C (45 degrees F) hotter than regular grass.

The only filler that didn\u2019t move water well was the conventional rubber (the standard filler in fields topped by artificial turf). Only about 1 millimeter (0.04 inch) of the stored water evaporated from its surface each day.",

            "The rain-cooled system was a big improvement over today\u2019s fake grass. And in the outdoor tests, rain fell often enough to supply all the water the system needed. But in hotter, drier cities, the system may need irrigation, as real grass does.",

            "Carbon capture refers to technology that tries to tackle climate change by capturing carbon dioxide, or CO2.",
            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, CO2 works like a blanket. It traps heat, warming our climate. Humans add a lot of CO2 to the air when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, for energy. Carbon capture can reduce this climate-warming CO2 pollution.",
            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

            "Orb weaver spiders (Araneus ventricosus) can use trapped fireflies to lure in more prey. They seem to do this by tricking the fireflies into changing the pattern of their light flashes. That switch attracts even more fireflies to the spider\u2019s web.",
            "These findings appear in the August 19 Current Biology.",
            "The firefly species that suffers this fate is Abscondita terminalis. It lives in tropical parts of Asia. Males have two lanterns. Females have just one. A single flash from a female usually helps male fireflies find her among tall grasses at dusk. Males are showier, giving off multiple light pulses to attract a mate.",
            "But if stuck in the web of an orb weaver spider, flashy males can become deadly decoys. By making male fireflies blink in a pattern more like females, the spider now lures other firefly males into its web.",

That\u2019s in Christchurch, New Zealand. The new findings add a unique hunting hack to spiders\u2019 skillsets, she says.",

            "When an orb weaver spider was around, male fireflies also were likely to get caught in its web and to change their flashing pattern. This was less likely when the spider was absent. These findings hint that something about the spiders affected the trapped fireflies\u2019 flashes.",
            "Further observations suggests that the fireflies\u2019 altered flashing pattern helped orb weavers catch more prey.",
            "To test this, Li\u2019s team used black ink to paint over the lanterns of some caught fireflies. Without their prey flashing, orb weavers were now less likely to capture more fireflies.\u00a0",
            "Orb weavers seemed to affect fireflies\u2019 flashes in a very specific way. Trapped males that had been bitten and wrapped in a spider\u2019s silk stopped using one of their lanterns to pulse light. Flashing just a single lantern, the males\u2019 signal became weaker, single pulses of light.",
            "These blinks appeared much closer to a female\u2019s flash pattern. That gave Li\u2019s team the idea that orb weavers make caught male fireflies look like females. This now coaxed more male prey into their webs.",
            "The orb weavers also handled fireflies differently than non-flashing beetle species, Li reports. The spiders wrapped other beetles in a thick layer of silk. Then they almost immediately began to eat them. They wrapped the fireflies more lightly, leaving their lanterns still visible. Then the spiders stocked away the wrapped fireflies in their web.\u00a0",
            "As more fireflies get caught, Li says, the spiders \u201crepeat the sequence for each of them \u2014 and leave them there, just flashing.\u201d",
            "Scientists still aren\u2019t sure how exactly orb weavers change fireflies\u2019 flashing patterns, Nelson says. Li suspects the spider\u2019s bite or venom has something to do with it. He\u2019s now planning to test those ideas. His team also plans to look for orb weavers outside of southeast Asia that might also use this tactic."

If you measure the properties of one particle, you automatically know the properties of the other. And whatever happens to one will also affect the other.",

From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",

            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",

That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."

            "After seven years of experimentation, a team of researchers at the Coralassist Lab at Newcastle University, in the United Kingdom, finally achieved its goals. Through selective breeding, they had for the first time ever produced adult corals capable of resisting marine heat waves \u2014 a potentially useful trait in an ever-warming world. Their work, published in October in Nature Communications, showed that corals can become better adapted to warming within a single generation.",
            "The rise in tolerance that they achieved was not large compared with how fast the ocean is warming. \u201cBut it\u2019s not an inconsequential jump,\u201d says Stephen Palumbi, a marine biologist at Stanford University who also works on heat tolerance in corals but was not involved in this study. \u201c[It\u2019s] not a small benefit.\u201d",
            "The Coralassist Lab lab is one of several coral restoration projects worldwide that are looking for ways to help corals acclimatize to increasingly common heat waves through assisted evolution \u2014 the practice of using human interventions to amp up natural processes. Some scientists are helping corals evolve more quickly by lab-breeding the symbiotic organisms that live inside them to be heat resistant. Others are gardening coral reefs in the wild so heat-resistant species can find each other and mate more easily.",
            "The field has been growing over the past 10 years. But big questions remain about whether scientists can identify the various genes linked with heat resistance, whether it\u2019s logistically possible to scale up these assisted evolution efforts, and whether they will make a difference, considering the pace of global warming.\n",
            "BQThe world\u2019s corals, from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, are undergoing their fourth mass bleaching since 1998.",
            "Coral reefs are some of the most vulnerable ecosystems on the planet, susceptible to pollution, ocean acidification, and overfishing. And as marine heat waves become stronger and more frequent, they are increasingly driving corals to expel their resident microalgae, which provide them with essential nutrients. Without their algae, corals can lose their vibrant colors, a phenomenon called bleaching, and starve to death.",
            "The world\u2019s corals, from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, are currently undergoing their fourth mass bleaching since 1998. That event killed about 8 percent of the world\u2019s coral, and between 2009 and 2018 about 14 percent of the world\u2019s remaining corals \u2014 about 4,500 square kilometers of them \u2014 were wiped out too, predominantly by heat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the Paris Agreement goal, coral reefs will decline by 70 to 90 percent by 2100.",
            "Working off previous studies that established that some corals naturally withstand heat better than others, the Coralassist team began its project by systematically mapping and heat testing 100 Acropora digitifera coral colonies in the highly diverse reefs of Palau, in the western Pacific Ocean. They exposed fragments from each colony to a temperature stress challenge in a laboratory tank that emulated the duration and intensity of marine heat waves. One group spent 10 days in water that gradually warmed by 3.5 degrees C; another group spent a month in water warmed by 2.5 degrees C.",

            "The team then selected the top and bottom performers and started matchmaking. Those with high heat tolerance would mingle their eggs and sperm together. Low-tolerance corals were similarly paired, and some couples were a mix of both. The resulting larvae, after attaching to ceramic tiles, were moved to nursery tanks on a local reef, where they grew for three to four years.",
            "At the end of their study, the team found that the heritability of heat tolerance was between 0.2 and 0.3 on a scale of 0 to 1, indicating that \u201cabout a quarter of the variability in offspring heat tolerance was due to genes passed from their parents,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThe response is not completely genetically driven, the environment also has some influence,\u201d says Adriana Humanes, a marine ecologist in the Coralassist Lab. \u201cBut you have a huge component of the genetics that is influencing the response to the heat stress.\u201d",
            "In their trials, the tolerance of adult offspring of high-heat-tolerant parents was increased through breeding by almost 1 \u201cdegree-heating week,\u201d a metric that refers to how much heat stress has accumulated in an area over the previous 12 weeks, compared to the corals with low-heat-tolerance parents. The study serves as proof of concept that selective breeding can boost heat tolerance in just one generation and endure into adulthood.\n",
            "BQThe genes that make a coral more tolerant to heat might also make it less fertile and slower growing, says a researcher.",
            "While the experiment showed there is scope for breeding, the improvement in heat resistance was still \u201cpretty modest compared to climate change,\u201d says Liam Lachs, an ecologist from the Coralassist lab who ran the team\u2019s statistical calculations. This year Palau\u2019s waters warmed at 10 degree-heating weeks, and the Caribbean hit 20 degree-heating weeks. In addition, the corals that were more heat resistant to short zaps of heat didn\u2019t do as well under longer-term exposure to heat, indicating that different genes might be responsible for resistance to different durations of heat.",
            "Coral researchers know that there is no single gene that confers heat resistance on corals: It\u2019s a \u201cvery complex trait encoded by many genes,\u201d says Annika Lamb, who runs a similar project with corals from the Great Barrier Reef at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS). Her lab is also trying to selectively breed heat-resistant corals, but she\u2019s using a faster method \u2014 applying a quick heat zap \u2014 as well as focusing on breeding corals from different species in the hopes of making sturdier hybrids.",
            "Breeding efforts must also take into consideration tradeoffs. The genes that make a coral more tolerant to heat might also make it less tolerant to disease, less fertile, less resistant to storms or cold, and slower growing, says Lamb. ",
            "Given these considerations, her team is also selectively breeding just the microalgae that live inside corals, which are to a large extent responsible for the actual temperature tolerance of a coral colony, says Madeleine van Oppen, head of AIMS\u2019 coral assisted-evolution project.\n",

            "Van Oppen has been selecting an array of microalgae from coral around the Great Barrier Reef, bolstering their heat tolerance by exposing multiple generations, over the course of 10 years, to elevated temperatures in a lab, and then reintroducing them into chemically bleached adult coral fragments.",
            "After initial lab tests, van Oppen started a trial on an inshore reef of the Great Barrier Reef. The results so far have been \u201creally promising,\u201d she says. During last summer\u2019s heat wave the corals inoculated with heat-evolved microalgae paled less and photosynthesized better than corals with closely related microalgae that hadn\u2019t been boosted for heat tolerance. But there are still questions about whether the microalgae will spread and stay healthy, and whether there are factors in the wild that haven\u2019t yet been taken into account. \u201cThis is a very young field,\u201d says van Oppen. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that there\u2019s a lot of unknown still.\u201d",
            "For instance, studies show that corals reared in labs often have weakened skeletons. This suggests they could be compromised once planted in ocean waters, says Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies in Australia. \u201cDespite long-standing claims that heat-tolerant super-corals can be bred in the laboratory and used to re-populate reefs, we still don\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s true,\u201d he says, noting that adding artificially bred corals to the wild gene pool is unlikely to make a significant difference except in extreme circumstances, as natural selection is already changing the mix of coral species on reefs.\n",
            "BQA million newly settled corals might sound like a lot, but \u201cin reality it\u2019s a drop in the ocean,\u201d says a marine biologist.",
            "\u201cCorals are always complicated. They\u2019re always doing something unexpected,\u201d says Stanford\u2019s Palumbi, whose lab is identifying heat-resistant corals in the wild and then running what he calls \u201ccommon gardening\u201d experiments on them. \u201cThese corals have been [evolving tolerance to changing conditions] for hundreds of thousands of years. They\u2019re already out there,\u201d says Palumbi, who also works in Palau, among other places. By collecting thousands of coral fragments from different reefs, testing them for resistance to a heat zap, and then moving the more heat-tolerant species and colonies to human-made reefs on metal frames, his team is giving them a chance to breed with a broader gene pool. ",
            "Preliminary findings from these tests, says Palumbi, suggest their offspring are similar in heat tolerance to Coralassist\u2019s 1 degree-heating week corals. \u201cWe\u2019re basically pursuing two pretty different but very parallel and complementary ways of looking at the same question,\u201d says Palumbi. But the new paper by the Coralassist team is the first to quantify an uptick in heat tolerance. \u201cThat number is something that really hasn\u2019t appeared in any other paper so far,\u201d he says.\n",
            "Still, the practical difficulties and costs of coral husbandry shouldn\u2019t be overlooked, says Hughes, and coral reef restoration is far more expensive than restoring seagrasses or mangroves. A million newly settled corals might sound like a lot, but \u201cin reality it\u2019s a drop in the ocean,\u201d says Hughes, who notes that the total area of reef worldwide currently occupied by laboratory-reared corals is a handful of square meters.",

            "fCMicroalgae bred to tolerate heat are applied to young corals grown at a lab of the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville, Australia.\nGiacomo d'Orlando",
            "\u201cThe most we can do in terms of reef restoration will always be very small in scale relative to the area to be covered,\u201d says Christopher Jury, a reef ecologist at the University of Hawai\u2019i at M\u0101noa. But recovering reefs the whole world over was never the goal, he says. Restoration efforts can protect small areas intended to provide seed material which, through normal reproduction, larval dispersal, and settlement on the seafloor, can foster the rejuvenation of reefs elsewhere. Of course, substantial climate change mitigation is a prerequisite if any of these other strategies are going to work to preserve reefs, he says, and breeding efforts are just meant to buy coral communities some extra time.\n",
            "The fact that coral abundance has plummeted due to climate change doesn\u2019t negate the fact that rapid evolution is already happening naturally in some surviving coral populations. When Jury\u2019s team semi-enclosed a naturally occurring coral reef community off Oahu and, for two years, subjected it to a combination of 2 degrees C warming and -0.2 pH units of acidification \u2014 akin to what oceans will experience with current rates of global warming \u2014 the communities shifted and changed while maintaining high rates of biodiversity. The corals recruited a diverse assemblage of algae, invertebrates, and microbes that helped them withstand the heat. So there is hope.",
            "Ultimately, the data gathered from all the experiments underway can help researchers improve their models of how corals will fare under global warming, says James Guest, the researcher who led the Coralassist Lab work. That team recently plugged their data from years of breeding experiments into computer models that will provide guidance on where and when interventions will be necessary and effective under various climate change scenarios. This work is forthcoming in Science.",
            "\u201cThere will be some instances where it\u2019s better just to leave the corals to their devices,\u201d says Guest. \u201cIt\u2019s just keeping a really open mind and constantly being prepared to update the advice based on new research.\u201d"

            "In the fall of 2023, the Biden administration announced $7 billion in funding for seven hydrogen hubs, slated to be built across the country over the next eight to 12 years. If all goes as planned, one of those hubs, the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2) \u2014 a network of more than a dozen interconnected hydrogen production centers, storage facilities, pipelines, and new solar farms that will power these operations \u2014 will stretch from southeastern Pennsylvania and neighboring southern New Jersey into Delaware. Expected to receive $750 million in federal funding, MACH2 is projected to create roughly 20,800 jobs in the Delaware Valley region, of which 6,400 will be permanent.",
            "The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) says that a sufficiently robust buildout of hydrogen production could power steelmaking, cement production, and other energy-intensive heavy industries, which account for more than a fifth of national carbon emissions and have been notoriously hard to decarbonize, as well as fueling ships, airplanes, and trucks. But some environmentalists and energy experts question whether investing so much money in hydrogen could siphon funding from more effective decarbonization strategies. Even a so-called \u201cgreen\u201d hub, which runs entirely on renewable energy, they say, might not provide the promised carbon-reduction benefits and could potentially even increase emissions.",
            "And residents of potential host communities \u2014 particularly the hard-pressed city of Chester, Pennsylvania, where some of the MACH2 facilities are planned \u2014 are concerned that they will bear the brunt of the potential risks and health hazards that hydrogen production and transport could bring.\n",
            "BQFew details about the Mid-Atlantic hydrogen hub have been shared with the public, unnerving community groups. ",
            "Scientists discovered how to extract usable hydrogen from water molecules using electrolysis in the 1800s, and as far back as 1874, novelist Jules Verne predicted it would someday be \u201cthe coal of the future.\u201d Hydrogen is, after all, the most abundant element on the planet, and it produces no carbon emissions when burned. The United States already produces 10 million metric tons of hydrogen a year \u2014 but most of it is derived from natural gas and is largely used in petroleum refining and in making ammonia for manufacturing fertilizer. Every ton of ammonia produced generates 2.6 tons of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, according to a report published in Green Chemistry.",
            "Still, scaling up low- or zero-carbon hydrogen production wasn\u2019t considered financially viable until passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, which offer substantial tax credits to producers of clean hydrogen. ",
            "Today, some proposed hubs are planning on producing \u201cblue\u201d hydrogen \u2014 that is, hydrogen created using natural gas but with the resulting carbon emissions captured and stored underground. Representatives of the MACH2 hub say that 82 percent of their production will be \u201cgreen,\u201d meaning powered by solar and wind; 15 percent will be \u201cpink\u201d \u2014 powered by the Salem and Hope Creek nuclear plants, in southern New Jersey; and the remaining 3 percent will be \u201corange\u201d \u2014 powered by biogas, which is produced when organic matter decomposes in an anaerobic environment.",

More information will be released in the project\u2019s next phase, expected to begin in the coming year.",
            "The lack of specificity has unnerved environmental and community groups. The Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental advocacy nonprofit, is alarmed by what it sees as a lack of proper safety precautions. Part of MACH2\u2019s plan involves repurposing old fossil fuel infrastructure to carry hydrogen. Like many aspects of the project, what that means isn\u2019t yet clear.",
            "MACH2 officials are currently creating an inventory of underutilized infrastructure, according to Matt Krayton, the communications lead for the hub. He says the hub would likely repurpose existing pipeline rights of way \u2014 every pipeline needs approval from landowners whose property would be crossed \u2014 and possibly the pipelines themselves, which would be re-sleeved with a hydrogen-safe polymer to prevent leaks.\n",
            "BQMaking green hydrogen to power short-haul planes and heavy-duty vehicles is neither economical nor efficient, a report finds.",
            "Some 1,600 miles of hydrogen pipelines are already operating across the U.S., and Nick Barilo, executive director of the Center for Hydrogen Safety at the American Institute of Chemical Engineers, noted that all combustible fuels carry a certain amount of risk, and hydrogen is no more dangerous than natural gas. \u201cThe U.S. industry has been using hydrogen for over a century,\u201d Barilo said. \u201cSafety knowledge and best practices for the production and transportation of hydrogen are well-established and mature.\u201d ",
            "In some potential host communities, like Chester, Pennsylvania, assurances like Barilo\u2019s fall flat. Fifteen miles outside of Philadelphia, the city once bustled with manufacturing and heavy industry. But after World War II, plants began to shutter, and the city entered a long decline. By 2020, its population was half its 1950 peak.\n",
            "Today, a third of Chester residents live in poverty, and the city, which declared bankruptcy in 2022, is host to 11 industries classified by the DEP as hazardous, including one of the largest incinerators in the nation.

But the industry still faces headwinds over its potential costs and benefits.",
            "Although burning hydrogen produces no direct greenhouse gas emissions, hydrogen that leaks into the atmosphere, according to a 2022 research paper published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, increases concentrations of other greenhouse gases, like methane, ozone, and water vapor. \u201cAny time you\u2019re handling [hydrogen], producing it, transporting it, storing it \u2014 [the molecule] is so small that the risk of leaks is significant,\u201d said Talor Musil, a field manager at the Pennsylvania-based nonprofit Environmental Health Project.\n",
            "And according to a recent report published by Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, an energy and climate policy think tank, making green hydrogen to power short-haul planes and heavy-duty vehicles \u2014 two sectors often touted as ripe for adopting hydrogen \u2014 is neither economical nor efficient. Roughly 20 to 30 percent of hydrogen\u2019s energy value is lost in the process of splitting water molecules, the report said, and another 15 percent may be lost during compression and storage. The Energy Innovation report ranked the potential end uses for hydrogen by their long-term viability and determined that it made the most financial and environmental sense for refining oil and producing ammonia for fertilizer, while also having value in steelmaking and long-haul aviation and marine shipping.",
            "BQWithout strict rules on the use of renewable energy, the hydrogen industry could actually increase overall emissions.",
            "Energy experts agree on these high-value uses for hydrogren, but the Inflation Reduction Act guarantees a tax credit for the fuel, no matter what its end use, for 10 years. Given rapid advances in battery technology, said the Energy Innovations report, it will be hard to justify hydrogen\u2019s expense in industries like trucking \u2014 which can operate far more cheaply using electricity \u2014 when the credit ends. A recent study by a group of Harvard researchers estimated that depending on what it\u2019s ultimately used for, green hydrogen may wind up being even less cost effective at fighting climate change than direct air capture of CO2, which the International Energy Agency estimated would have an operating cost, when scaled up, of between $230 and $630 per metric ton of CO2 captured.",
            "And then there\u2019s the matter of impact. The seven hubs combined are projected to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 25 million metric tons of CO2 a year (not counting the emissions linked with hydrogen production). The total tonnage is not significant, some experts say \u2014 it amounts to less than half of one percent of total U.S. CO2 emissions \u2014 considering the $7 billion in taxpayer support. But the Energy Department considers the hubs a catalyst, a way to \u201ckickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure\u201d; presumably, costs of hydrogen production will drop as the industry develops.\n",

            "Unless the federal government implements strict rules on carbon capture and the use of green energy for the hubs, the industry could actually increase overall emissions, according to the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Last November, Rachel Fakhry, the NRDC\u2019s policy director for emerging technologies, testified before the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee that, for hydrogen to be truly sustainable, green hubs would need to abide by three main tenets: buying electricity from newly built renewable energy sources, rather than pulling existing renewables from the grid (a requirement known as \u201cadditionality\u201d); matching their hourly use with the availability of green energy, which prevents hubs from dipping into fossil fuels and buying clean energy credits after the fact; and using clean energy that\u2019s produced close to the hubs, ensuring that its delivery doesn\u2019t lead to increased emissions. Legislators and industry groups are already indicating they will challenge a proposed additionality requirement.",
            "As the federal government works to finalize how it will regulate the hydrogen tax credits, energy experts continue to grapple with the potential significance, and value, of the proposed hubs. \u201cOne of the big challenges in the broader field of serious, big systems decarbonization is we\u2019re sort of talking about various imaginaries,\u201d said Danny Cullenward, a climate economist and senior fellow at University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy. \u201cWe\u2019re throwing money at the hubs. We\u2019re throwing money through this tax credit at the production of hydrogen. But there isn\u2019t really anything resembling a coordinated strategy for what\u2019s the right use of hydrogen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a really weird thing, if you think about it.\u201d"

More than three-quarters of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity occurs in forests. Wooded areas filter and manage rainwater, provide shade, soak up pollution, regulate climate, provide oxygen, and salve our spirits.",

            "Jake M. Robinson: Back then, something like 45 to 60 percent of the terrestrial surface of Earth was covered in forests. It has rapidly changed. We have gone from about 6 billion hectares of forest to 4 billion. We have lost a third of the planet\u2019s forests in the last 10,000 years. About 50 percent of that loss has been just in the last 100 years or so. That\u2019s how much it\u2019s sped up since the Industrial Revolution. But the nature of forests is changing too. There are pockets of natural virgin forests left, but much of it is monoculture plantation.",

            "Robinson: No, there isn\u2019t a consensus. Some people have the idea that we should be restoring ecosystems back to what they were like before humans started intervening in them. Another view is we need to restore the functions and the processes of ecosystems and the biodiversity they support, not necessarily this ideal picture of what it was a few thousand years ago. I would like to see us recognize that humans are part of the ecosystem and that it\u2019s okay that we\u2019re altering the land: Indigenous peoples have been changing ecosystems for tens of thousands of years.\n",

            "Robinson: This was partly catalyzed by a 2019 Science study, which is quite controversial in the restoration ecology sector. They basically ran some models and showed that 900 million hectares is available to support forests, which could host about another a trillion trees. That simple idea took off, stratospherically. The authors weren\u2019t literally advocating planting a trillion trees, nor did they mean to imply that there aren\u2019t other essential ecosystems, like grasslands.

In urban areas, around 30 percent of trees that are planted die within the first five years of life. If you plant trees in ecosystems where trees simply shouldn\u2019t be growing, you can remove the biodiversity that evolved with those niches. Probably the majority of ecosystem restoration projects fail or don\u2019t meet their stated goals. There\u2019s a big social element as well, because lots of people are already on the land that is put aside for tree planting; you can end up displacing them.

Several hundred years ago there were 100,000 Indigenous people supported by the forests in the Coixtlahuaca district, and now there\u2019s fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. The land can\u2019t support them, it\u2019s so degraded from agriculture and poor land management. Twenty years ago the soil was essentially rock. The local communities had to crush the rock so it could retain water, and then they planted these little nurse species \u2014 a non-native tree called Gregg\u2019s pines that\u2019s well adapted to poor conditions and won\u2019t reproduce \u2014 just to kickstart the ecosystem. These trees died and their carbon made it into the soil. It\u2019s an ongoing project \u2014 it\u2019s not yet a flourishing ecosystem \u2014 but it just shows that it can start from zero.",

It looks quite like a rainforest. He mostly focuses on non-annual plants \u2014 fruits and vegetables, nuts and mushrooms.

It\u2019s been quite eye-opening, and I think it\u2019ll be a useful monitoring tool in the future. We\u2019ve also recently found that white noise can stimulate fungi, promoting growth.

By one official measure, natural products from the Amazon make up less than 0.01 percent of the country\u2019s economy. But Carlos Nobre of the National Institute for Amazonian Research, in a manifesto for a New Economy for the Brazilian Amazon published by the World Resources Institute last year, found that such data seriously underestimate its importance. The bioeconomy \u201cis partially invisible in national accounts,\u201d he said, because many local transactions take place outside the formal economy. ",
            "Nobre puts their economic contribution more than 10 times higher than previous estimates. He says that a fully developed Amazon bioeconomy based of fruits of the forest could reach $6.75 billion by 2050 and employ nearly a million people. But will it happen?\n",
            "Nobre co-chairs the Science Panel for the Amazon, a grouping of 280 conservation-minded scientists which argues that a successful socio-bioeconomy for the region requires not just the promotion of a handful of charismatic forest crops, but more radical policy shifts. It requires stopping activities such as cattle ranching and mining that threaten Indigenous rights or damage their forests, and instead engaging with local producers to build the infrastructure they need to grow their businesses, such as electricity supplies for refrigerating and processing forest products, and reliable transportation to facilitate trade.

Less than a quarter has gone into developing products from native forest species or sustaining small-scale family farming ",

            "About 18 months ago, climate scientists began to notice something strange. In March of 2023, global sea surface temperatures started to rise. In a warming world, the seas would be expected to grow hotter, but the rise, which came at a time when the Pacific Ocean was in the neutral phase of the weather pattern known as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, was unusually steep. In April, 2023, sea surface temperatures set a new record. They did so again in May.\n",
            "As the months went on, the weirdness continued. In the summer of 2023, the world entered an El Ni\u00f1o, the warm phase of ENSO. El Ni\u00f1os typically bring higher temperatures, but in the second half of 2023, both sea surface and air temperatures increased so much that scientists were stunned. One called the figures \u201cabsolutely gobsmackingly bananas.\u201d\n",
            "In an essay that appeared in Nature this past March, NASA\u2019s chief climate scientist, Gavin Schmidt said: \u201cIt\u2019s humbling, and a bit worrying, to admit that no year has confounded climate scientists\u2019 predictive capabilities more than 2023 has.\u201d\n",
            "Officially, the El Ni\u00f1o ended in May 2024. But global temperatures have remained stubbornly high. This year they are expected to set yet another record.",
            "Schmidt says that scientists still can\u2019t explain the unexpected spike in temperatures. When I talked with him recently, he called the continuing confusion \u201ca little embarrassing\u201d for researchers.",

            "Scientists have identified several recent developments that could have contributed to the last year and a half of anomalous warmth. The first is a set of rules that reduced the sulfur content of the fuel used in super tankers. Since sulfur dioxide pollution reflects sunlight, this change, while good for public health, could have led to increased ocean heating. ",
            "A second potential contributor is an unusual eruption that occurred in January 2022. Normally, volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide and so produce temporary cooling. But the eruption of Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2018apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific, sent water vapor shooting into the stratosphere, which could have had a warming effect.",
            "Yet another possible contributor is the solar cycle. The sun is currently at, or near, a peak of activity, and this, too, could be boosting temperatures.",
            "At this point, though, Schmidt says, none of these developments \u2014 or even a combination of all of them \u2014 seems sufficient to explain the heat. This, in turn, raises several other possibilities. The recent temperature run-up could be the result of some development that\u2019s yet to be identified. Or it could mean the climate system is more unpredictable than was thought. Alternatively, it could indicate that something is missing from climate models, or that amplifying feedbacks are kicking in sooner than the models had predicted.\n",

We expected that 2023 would be another warm year because all of the years are warm now, but it probably wasn\u2019t going to be a record-warm year. So when the records started to be broken, first in the North Atlantic in March and April, June, and then the global mean in June, and then throughout the rest of the year, and then absolutely ridiculously large record-breaking events in the fall \u2014 August, September, October, November \u2014 people started using adjectives that scientists don\u2019t generally tend to use.",
            "At the end of 2023, we summed it up: It was a record warm year and it was a record-breaking size of the record. Our eyebrows at this point were rolling over the top of our heads. It was clear that the predictions that people had made at the beginning of year were all wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter what the method was, they were all wrong, and they were all wrong by about 0.2 degrees Celsius. Now that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a big deal. ",
            "You can accommodate a missed prediction in two ways. You can either say, your actual prediction was wrong. Or you can say, no, we underestimated the uncertainty.\n",
            "So at the beginning of 2024, we thought: Hopefully we\u2019ll get some more information from people doing science for all the different things that were happening. And maybe we\u2019ll get some more analyses of the internal variability. Some of that has happened, but not in a coordinated way. And it\u2019s still pretty much, I would say, amateur hour in terms of assessing what actually happened in 2023.",
            "Kolbert: There was a whole list of things people thought might have contributed.",

            "One other event was the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha\u02bbapai volcano in the South Pacific, which was a very unusual eruption. It put a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is normally super dry. That was a very new thing, and people were saying, well, maybe that\u2019s contributing.",
            "People were also talking about unusual behavior of the Saharan dust or the wind pattern in the North Atlantic. People were talking about long-term, ongoing changes in how much pollution is coming from China and India. Maybe those things are changing faster than we anticipated. The pollution in the air is a cooling factor, and so if you take it away, then that\u2019s a warming factor.",
            "The science that\u2019s been done has not been equally spread amongst all of those things. A lot of people have looked at the impact of the marine shipping regulation change. If you take that and you put it into some climate model and you estimate the temperature change, right now you\u2019d expect about 0.05 of a degree, 0.08 of a degree [of warming per year], and then building over a decade to about 0.1 degree. So that seems like it helps, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s sufficient. And the first paper that came out about the volcano, they said, no, no, the normal cooling volcanic pollution is still bigger than the warming water vapor component. So now I have more warming to explain and less things to explain it.\n",

            "Schmidt: Like I said, there\u2019s two reasons why you could have messed up the prediction. One is you are missing some driving element. Another is you are underestimating the spread. Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off. And you could think of things being more off in multiple ways because the system is changing in a way where what happened in the past is no longer a good guide to what\u2019s going to happen in the future. And that\u2019s concerning. For example, we have huge industries and huge expectations based on temperature anomalies that are associated with [El Ni\u00f1o].\n",

That\u2019s very difficult to predict. I have this feeling that what we\u2019re doing will influence these decisions, but I don\u2019t know how it will influence these decisions. And so my best plan is just to do the best that we can in terms of the science and hope that by knowing more about the system, people will make better choices.

            "Shepherd: The track forecasts have improved significantly. We still have a ways to go with the intensity forecast, and we know why. Track forecasts are governed more by the large steering conditions of the atmosphere that the models can pick up. But the intensity forecasts are governed by the ocean heat content, by the convection that\u2019s happening inside the clouds. These are things we don\u2019t often have readily available data on to go into the model.

I think with Milton, it went from a Category 1 to a Category 5 in less than 24 hours. This explosive development is really a fingerprint of climate change.",

            "Here in Burnt Corn Valley, smack in the middle of the Navajo reservation\u2019s vast Black Mesa region, the hilly land both craves water and is brutalized by it. The sandy Arizona soil cracks under a punishing August sun as red-striped blister beetles search for moisture across its baked surface. Cottonwood trees and sagebrush rise from deep gullies carved by floodwaters that, during the intensifying summer monsoon, sluice off surrounding mesas and wash away fragile topsoil \u2014 reminders that with climate change, even quenching rains harbor powers of destruction.",
            "This portrait of climatic havoc belies a softer reality, though. Farming once thrived in this parched region and could once again \u2014 if the right practices are adopted. Exhibit A: The crops on Roberto Nutlouis\u2019s 12-acre Sliding Rock Farm, in his reservation hometown of Pi\u00f1on, a five-hour drive north of Phoenix. \u201cThe corn is actually pretty big and thriving,\u201d Nutlouis says. He believes \u2014 and both Western science and the lived experience of his Native elders affirm \u2014 that the traditional rock and stick structures he\u2019s built on his property, which help store water and prevent erosion, have a lot to do with it. These structures, similar to those used by Native peoples long before Europeans arrived on the continent, are not only delivering water to crops (the broader, 27,000-square-mile reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S.). They are also restoring Nutlouis\u2019s watershed and those of his neighbors, helping to sequester carbon, and reviving this high-desert ecosystem. It\u2019s all part of a bigger effort among a range of local and regional grassroots organizations to build back the reservation\u2019s fragile, depleted ecosystems and bring greater sovereignty over food, water, and health to its communities.\n",
            "BQPeople living in arid zones have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture water for crops.",
            "Din\u00e9 (the Navajo name for themselves) are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive. Depending on elevation, precipitation in Black Mesa averages 6 to 16 inches a year; recent heat extremes \u2014 the Navajo government declared a state of emergency in 2023 due to soaring temperatures \u2014mean that the scant water evaporates more quickly. Climate models predict the region will experience increasing droughts that decimate plant life, part of a growing trend of human-caused desertification across the globe, as well as higher-intensity seasonal rainfall, which can sweep away crops and roads. The ecological health of the reservation has also been weakened by deforestation from timbering operations and from overgrazing over the years.",
            "Still, this season, Nutlouis, 44, has been able to skip his usual two-hour roundtrip drive to a reliable well to haul water home for his corn. His crop is healthy and hydrated because his land still holds last winter\u2019s snowmelt. Clearly, his heavy labor over the past 20 years \u2014 during which he has built woven brush dams, gabions (wirework cages filled with rocks), earthen berms, concrete spillways and trenches, limestone aprons and walls, and stone-lined \u201cZuni bowls,\u201d which stabilize eroding streambeds \u2014 is paying off.",

            "Din\u00e9 and others living in arid zones around the world have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture and control water to grow crops and to mitigate the devastation of floods in ephemeral stream systems. Various Puebloans, including Zuni and Hohokam, used similar devices, as did the Aztecs. Arab peoples and tribes in India have incorporated stone water diversions for thousands of years. \u201c[M]ost traditional Indigenous communities are not passive observers of nature,\u201d writes Lyla June Johnston, a Din\u00e9 anthropologist and community organizer. Instead, they are \u201cinfluential facilitators of landscape scale abundance, rooted in an ethic of kinship and reverence.\u201d",
            "Time and again over the last 15 years, Laura Norman, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has seen evidence that when these structures \u2014 which Norman calls Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams, or NIDS \u2014 are placed in gullies, they slow water to mitigate erosion, collect nutrient-rich sediment and plant debris that nourish both crops and wild plants, help store carbon, improve groundwater recharge, and increase downstream water availability by as much as 28 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect that counters degradation, and you get all of these ecosystem services,\u201d she says.",
            "The structures on Nutlouis\u2019s farm are integral cogs in a larger system of floodplain farming. It works like this: Nutlouis\u2019s property lies in an alluvial fan, where mineral-rich sediments and plant waste atop mesas and other uplands wash down onto flatter ground with rainwater, snowmelt, and spring water. Across the valley, similar farms rely on this kind of system, many of which feature stone and stick constructions that Nutlouis helped build. The organic materials trapped behind the structures, says Jonathan Sandor, an emeritus agronomy professor at Iowa State University, \u201care a major input into keeping the fertility of the soils up.\u201d Such small watersheds are optimal: \u201cThese gentle slopes and small watersheds allow runoff but reduce the possibility of high runoff velocities that may damage crops,\u201d Sandor explained in a 2008 paper.",
            "BQ\u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d says an expert.",
            "Whether rock walls or ramps, hand-dug depressions in the soil, earthen walls, or branches plaited into dams, NIDS splash water over a wider area and slow its flow so it can better soak into the soil. Many trap sediments behind them, fertilizing whatever grows nearby. The stone structures create a hyperlocal cooling effect, especially when they\u2019re combined with shade-making vegetation.",
            "Here, too, smallness is a boon. \u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d Norman says. Up to five kilometers downstream from such structures, \u201cwe\u2019ve documented increased vegetation despite drought. We\u2019ve also documented [increased vegetation] up to one kilometer upstream, which indicates water availability.\u201d In this way, an alluvial farm and its NIDS can support plants both sown and wild.\n",
            "\u201cThe moisture we get from winter precipitation is really important for the corn to germinate and grow,\u201d says Nutlouis, \u201cand the monsoon rain is really important to finish our harvest of corn and squash and melons.\u201d He acknowledges that in practice this can look chaotic, with cornfields flooded up to their ears before the water trickles down to the next field.",

            "But lately, climate change has thrown extra challenges at the reservation. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious soil moisture deficit that\u2019s causing a lot of ecological shifts,\u201d Nutlouis says. Much of Black Mesa\u2019s pinyon forest, he says, has succumbed to two decades of drought. Historically, Din\u00e9 have foraged for pinyon pine nuts. They are an important component of food sovereignty on the reservation, and their loss is acutely felt.",
            "But the ecosystem services provided by Nutlouis\u2019s structures on his farm and elsewhere do seem to be meeting those climatic challenges. He\u2019s noticed small juniper trees popping up on hillsides around his property despite the dryness; A cottonwood tree towering over one cornfield is also lush and full. \u201cThe idea that Earth will restore itself with natural seed dispersal\u201d after NIDS begin to do their job \u201chas been my observation,\u201d says Norman. Or as Nutlouis puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re allowing nature to do its own thing and restore itself.\u201d",
            "Still, Nutlouis is inclined to help the process along. His nonprofit Nihikeya (loosely translated as a collective ecological footprint) collaborates with a variety of local and regional grassroots groups that work on food, water, and justice issues, like Tolani Lake Enterprises, First Nations Development Institute, and the Ten Tribes Partnership. Din\u00e9 C.A.R.E., another collaborator, is an environmental justice organization that advocates for community health and land rights across the reservation, as well as for the cleanup of coal- and uranium-polluted rivers and aquifers. \u201cWe especially want to support a lot of renewable projects through solar and wind, and we want to support agriculture too, because having a robust food system is a form of revenue for local farmers,\u201d says executive director Robyn Jackson. \u201cIt also helps with continuing our cultural traditions.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to farming into the future,\u201d says a Navajo activist.",
            "Nihikeya also works closely with the water-rights organization T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed, whose members are collecting native plant seeds to restore riparian habitat across Black Mesa. Some of those native plants, like wolfberry, are edible, which will also help improve food sovereignty and security. \u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to continuing farming into the future,\u201d says T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed executive director Nicole Horseherder.",
            "To house accessions of pinyon and juniper, willow, wolfberry bush, three-leaf sumac, and rabbit brush, Nutlouis is building a seed bank. When put back into the landscape, these plants will help keep the ground moist and mitigate erosion.\n",
            "Nutlouis is working on his master\u2019s degree in sustainable communities at Northern Arizona University, where he studies the Western science that qualifies and quantifies the benefits of traditional practices. But he is also adamant that watershed restoration success is predicated on reforging ancestral kinship connections \u2014 that is, on returning the power to make land-use decisions to clan mothers, who were traditionally Din\u00e9 leaders in this arena. To that end, he\u2019s been meeting with neighbors in one tiny watershed of Burnt Corn Valley after another to discuss how to improve the health of their land, whether for growing corn or just ensuring roads remain intact when it rains. So far, Nutlouis has helped restore 56 fields across the valley, with more NIDS than he can count.",

One of her NIDS study sites saw its water availability extended from three months to four months. \u201cYou can envision how important that is for arid lands,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing this kind of farming way before the Europeans came, and that\u2019s what our ancestors were known for,\u201d says Nutlouis. \u201cThe work we do is looking back at ancestral wisdom, reclaiming and re-correcting knowledge, de-colonizing and re-Indigenizing.\u201d He continues, \u201cEcologies needs to be restored. Food systems need to be restored. This is an opportunity to begin developing localized food economies. There\u2019s a lot of potential in that, but we got to do it right.\u201d",

            "Some 50 miles southwest of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, and strategically located close to a cluster of the island\u2019s top universities, the 3,500-acre Hsinchu Science Park is globally celebrated as the incubator of Taiwan\u2019s most successful technology companies. It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. ",
            "Today Taiwan\u2019s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan\u2019s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. ",
            "It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent.\n",
            "BQBy 2030, Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry will consume twice as much electricity as the whole of New Zealand.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s more than 23 million people consume nearly as much energy per capita as U.S. consumers, but the lion\u2019s share of that consumption \u2014 56 percent \u2014 goes to Taiwan\u2019s industrial sector for companies like TSMC. In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan\u2019s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s government is banking on the continuing success of its technology sector and wants the island to be a leader in A.I. But just one small data center, the Vantage 16MW Data center in Taipei, is expected to require as much energy as some 13,000 households. Nicholas Chen, a lawyer who analyses Taiwan\u2019s climate and energy policies, warns that the collision of Taiwan\u2019s commitments to the clean energy transition and its position in global supply chains as a key partner of multinational companies that have made commitments to net-zero deadlines \u2014 along with the explosive growth in demand \u2014 has all the makings of a crisis.\n",
            "\u201cIn order to plan and operate A.I. data centers, an adequate supply of stable, zero-carbon energy is a precondition,\u201d he said. \u201cA.I. data centers cannot exist without sufficient green energy.

The island depends on imported fossil fuel for around 90 percent of its energy and lives under the growing threat of blockade, quarantine, or invasion from China. In addition, for political reasons, the government has pledged to close its nuclear sector by 2025.",
            "Taiwan regularly attends U.N. climate meetings, though never as a participant. Excluded at China\u2019s insistence from membership in the United Nations, Taiwan asserts its presence on the margins, convening side events, and adopting the Paris Agreement targets of peak emissions before 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. Its major companies, TSMC included, have signed up to RE100, a corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged to achieve net zero production. But right now, there is a wide gap between aspiration and performance. ",
            "Angelica Oung, a journalist and founder of the Clean Energy Transition Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for a rapid energy transition, has studied Taiwan\u2019s energy sector for years. When we met in a restaurant in Taipei, she cheerfully ordered an implausibly large number of dishes that crowded onto the small table as we talked. Oung described two major blackouts \u2014 one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge.\n",

            "Taiwan\u2019s current energy mix illustrates the scale of the challenge: Last year, Taiwan\u2019s power sector was 83 percent dependent on fossil fuel: Coal accounted for around 42 percent of generation; natural gas 40 percent; and oil 1 percent. Nuclear supplied 6 percent, and solar, wind, hydro, and biomass together, nearly 10 percent, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, which leaves the island at the mercy both of international price fluctuations and potential blockade by China. The government has sought to shield consumers from rising global prices, but that has resulted in growing debt for the Taiwan Electric Power Company (Taipower), the national provider. In the event of a naval blockade by China, Taiwan could count on about six weeks reserves of coal but not much more than a week of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Given that LNG supplies more than a third of electricity generation, the impacts would be severe. \n",

The 2050 net-zero roadmap released by Taiwan\u2019s National Development Council in 2022 promised to shut down its nuclear sector by 2025. By the same year, the share of coal would have to come down to 30 percent, gas would have to rise to 50 percent, and renewables would have to leap to 20 percent. None of those targets is on track. ",
            "Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. \u201cThe problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don\u2019t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.\u201d Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks.",
            "According to Peter Kurz, a consultant to the technology sector and a long-term resident of Taiwan, there is one renewable resource that the nation has in abundance. \u201cThe Taiwan Strait has a huge wind resource,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the most wind power anywhere in the world available close to a population.\u201d",

            "Offshore wind is under development, but the government is criticized for imposing burdensome requirements to use Taiwanese products and workers that the country is not well equipped to meet. They reflect the government\u2019s ambition to build a native industry at the same time as addressing its energy problem. But critics point out that Taiwan lacks the specialist industrial skills that producing turbines demands, and the requirements lead to higher costs and delays.",
            "Despite the attraction of Taiwan\u2019s west coast with its relatively shallow waters, there are other constraints, such as limited harbor space. There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan\u2019s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters from China\u2019s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable.",
            "Government critics regard one current policy as needless self-harm: the pledge to shut down Taiwan\u2019s remaining nuclear reactor by next year and achieve a \u201cnuclear free homeland.\u201d It is a pledge made by the current ruling party, the Democratic People\u2019s Party (DPP) and, as the deadline approaches, it is a policy increasingly being questioned. Taiwan\u2019s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978. The DPP came into existence in 1986, the year of the Chernobyl disaster, and its decision to adopt a no-nuclear policy was reinforced by the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan in 2011.",

The shuttered reactors have not yet been decommissioned, possibly because, in addition to its other difficulties, Taiwan has run out of waste storage capacity: The fuel rods remain in place because there is nowhere else to put them. As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change. Voters added to the confusion in 2021 when they opposed the completion of the two uncommissioned plants.",
            "On the 13th floor of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei, the deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s energy administration, Stephen Wu, chose his words carefully. \u201cThere is a debate going on in our parliament,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the public has demanded a reduction of nuclear power and also a reduction in carbon emissions. So there is some discussion about whether the [shuttered] nuclear plants will somehow function again when conditions are ready.\u201d",

The fact that its technology industry is essential for global production of everything from electric vehicles to ballistic missiles has counted as a security plus for Taiwan in its increasingly tense stand-off with China. It is not in the interest of China or the United States to see semiconductor manufacturers damaged or destroyed. Such companies, in security jargon, are collectively labelled Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a shield the government is keen to maintain. That the sector depends inescapably on Taiwan\u2019s energy security renders the search for a solution all the more urgent."

            "Down on the south end of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, oil rigs have plumbed the earth like flocks of blackened drinking birds for more than a century. Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "fCParabolic mirrors at a solar thermal plant in Kramer Junction, California. \nWarren Gretz / NREL",
            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

            "Researchers at NREL had been thinking about something like GeoTES for years, but they needed funding and land to make it a reality, which led them to partner with a Kern County-based energy investment firm, Premier Resource Management, in Bakersfield. In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea. By early this year, when California officially announced a ban on new permits for hydraulic fracking, they were fully focused on a way to give the old wells new life \u2014 as a battery, of sorts.\n",
            "BQTo survive a downturn in oil and gas, Kern County aims to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub.",
            "In its heyday in the mid-1980s, Kern County produced 256 million barrels of oil a year, and it remains the seventh-largest oil producing county in the U.S. Despite the industry\u2019s harm \u2014 more people per capita die from chronic lower respiratory disease here than anywhere else in California \u2014 drilling still pumps $13 billion a year into the local economy. Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

            "The geothermal industry would appear to offer a relatively seamless shift for many oilfield workers. Often, contractors can simply apply their skills to hot water instead of oil. As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",
            "Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology for the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council, a global nonprofit that works to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage, cautions that 10-hour energy-storage solutions will help us get through the swing from night to day, but that we produce and consume renewable energy on a scale that spans seasons.\n",
            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

Plankton are at the base of the ocean food chain, feeding fish that feed billions of people. They are responsible for half of the world\u2019s oxygen supply and half of our planet\u2019s annual carbon sink. Miniscule but powerful, their presence can help or hinder ecosystems \u2014 by soaking up greenhouse gas, for example, or by spewing toxins. Where plankton live, how many there are, when they bloom and which species dominate each play a huge role in this delicate balance. And our changing climate is spurring a sea change in all of it.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re headed into an ocean and, for that matter, a world that we\u2019re not going to recognize because it\u2019s changing so fundamentally,\u201d says David Hutchins, a marine microbiologist at the University of Southern California, who has charted plankton\u2019s future.\n",
            "Climate change is hitting our oceans hard, making them warmer and more acidic, while radically altering currents. The outlook for plankton is mixed. Some studies report overall plankton numbers dropping, while others show them rising in some major ocean basins. As the planet warms, the diversity of the menagerie in many spots is increasing, says Clare Ostle, a marine biogeochemist at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. But certain species are losing out, she adds, including big juicy plankton thought to be important for food webs and carbon sequestration. And, in the long term, plankton numbers may plummet as climate change starves them of nutrients.\n",
            "BQScientists are shocked by the knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says one expert.",
            "Scientists are now struggling to work out what the net effect will be. They have some new technologies at their disposal, including a new NASA satellite called PACE \u2014 for Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem \u2014 launched this February. And some old ones, including a decades-old program that painstakingly trawls the ocean with filters to scoop up tiny creatures and count them by hand. Yet scientists say they are shocked by the size of our knowledge gaps. \u201cI always find it surprising how little is known about plankton,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "The Ocean Stewardship Coalition this month released a \u201cplankton manifesto\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, highlighting how important plankton are alongside how little we know about them. \u201cThe planetary importance of plankton remains largely ignored,\u201d the group writes, alongside a plea for more research, education, and discussion in international treaties about plankton\u2019s plight.\n",
            "The word \u201cplankton,\u201d from the Greek for \u201cwanderer,\u201d is a catchall for the host of tiny creatures that live in fresh or salty water and drift where the currents take them. That includes plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and things that blur the lines between categories in a way that land-dwelling organisms typically don\u2019t. There are phytoplankton that feed on sunlight and CO2, including glassy diatoms, dinoflagellates with whip-like tendrils, and spherical coccolithophores that are struggling against ocean acidification to build hard calcite shells. Others are zooplankton \u2014 tiny animals including shelled foraminifera, along with fish larvae, tiny worms, and even jellyfish. Some have a lifespan of just days; others, years.",

His modelling, in agreement with other work, predicts that as waters warm, plankton will move polewards at a rate of about 21 miles per decade. \u201cSome changes will be massive, like in the Arctic, where entire communities will be replaced by something new,\u201d he says. Phytoplankton seem better able to cope with gradual warming than zooplankton, Benedetti says, so their habitat range and diversity looks set to increase in most regions. But that\u2019s not necessarily good news: the most productive ocean regions, counterintuitively, have low diversity, Benedetti notes. And more diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher numbers of plankton overall.",
            "In the long term, researchers fear an overall decline in plankton numbers thanks to a dwindling supply of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and iron. Plankton typically rely on nutrients that have been mixed from the ocean bottom up to the surface. But melting polar ice and changing ocean currents are now increasing the density difference between top, fresh waters and deeper, saltier waters, making these layers ever-less-likely to mix. This increased \u201cstratification,\u201d as it is called, is expected to starve ever-more regions of the ocean. While some coastal regions are drowning in too much nitrogen, which runs off agricultural fields, much of the open ocean might become \u201cmore desert-like,\u201d says Hutchins.\n",
            "BQScientists have investigated dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. ",
            "A factor working against this trend is pollution from both the burning of fossil fuels and from wildfires, which can carry nutrients far out into ocean waters. The wildly destructive Australian wildfire season of 2019-2020, for example, poured so much nutritional iron into the water that phytoplankton concentrations doubled between New Zealand and South America, creating an algae bloom bigger than Australia that lasted for months. The biggest surprise was how long the blooms lasted, says Jakob Weis at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, who studied the phenomenon. The amount of carbon soaked up by those organisms is thought to have roughly matched the carbon spewed by the fires \u2014 a helpful factor in the context of climate change. \u201cWe intentionally refrained from framing the blooms as \u2018good news,\u2019 given the devastating impact the wildfires had on the Australian public, wildlife, terrestrial ecosystems, and climate,\u201d says Weis. But the plankton, at least, were \u201chappy.\u201d",
            "Such nutrient influxes could be a big deal, says Hutchins, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where waters are particularly starved of iron. But the long-term impacts are entirely unclear. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s going to balance out some of what\u2019s not mixing up from below, or if it\u2019s going to select for different communities, different species, because it\u2019s chemically different [food],\u201d says Hutchins. Such blooms won\u2019t make a big dent in the big-picture fight against global warming, adds Ostle. \u201cWe\u2019ve burned thousands of years of deposits of oil and gas. The phytoplankton blooms aren\u2019t going to be able to cut it.\u201d\n",

            "Since the 1990s, some small-scale experiments have investigated the idea of intentionally dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. But early tests suggested that such a geoengineering scheme might not be very effective at burying carbon in the seabed for the longterm, while being expensive and difficult to carry out \u2014 not to mention the possibly huge, unknown consequences for ocean life. There have been international moratoria against large-scale commercial fertilization efforts since 2008, but research into the idea continues. Just last month, Ken Buesseler at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and colleagues laid out a research agenda for how to best assess this strategy\u2019s possible risks and benefits. \u201cYou learn a lot from these experiments,\u201d says Benedetti, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t see this as a long-term solution.\u201d",
            "In the face of so much uncertainty, it\u2019s vital for researchers to get on-the-ground data about how plankton are faring. The longest-running program to do this is the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, an effort that has been attaching collection devices onto ocean-crossing ships since the 1930s. The technique is simple: Plankton get scooped out of surface waters and squashed onto a filter like bugs on a car windscreen. The filter rolls up as the ship moves along, creating a scroll-like record of plankton roadkill from across the ship\u2019s track. Those filters are delivered to a lab where they are unspooled and the plankton peered at through a microscope. About a dozen workers at the Marine Biological Association, the effort\u2019s headquarters, have been trained to identify more than 600 different types of tiny creature \u2014 a task they are now trying to bolster with artificial intelligence algorithms.\n",

Ostle, who heads up the Pacific Branch of the CPR, says the data here shows plankton biomass increasing near the pole and decreasing closer to the tropics, as expected.",
            "Most of the increase is, interestingly, diatoms, says Ostle \u2014 large, round phytoplankton that form juicy food balls for fish and which tend to sink quickly, making them good carbon storage bombs. \u201cIt was a surprise to see this,\u201d says Ostle. It\u2019s an important shift: \u201cDiatoms are really the engines of carbon fixation,\u201d says Hutchins, who estimates they are responsible for about half of phytoplanktons\u2019 total carbon uptake.\n",
            "Ostle suspects the explanation behind the unexpected North Atlantic diatom boom lies with sunlight. The increased ocean stratification that can stop nutrients from mixing upwards has also managed to trap diatoms in surface waters that are bathed in more light; they stay in the growing zone for longer. Eventually, says Ostle, the food disadvantage of increased stratification will likely outweigh the light advantage. But when and how remains uncertain.",

            "The story varies from region to region. In the northeast Atlantic, around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining at rates of around 10 percent per decade. Some researchers have even suggested that the infamous North Sea cod crash in the 1990s, usually attributed to overfishing, was exacerbated by a plankton deficit. In the Arctic Ocean, though, plankton numbers have blossomed, with productivity increasing by more than half between 1998 and 2018, thanks not just to more open water from melting ice but also to increased nutrients, possibly introduced to the Arctic by storms and shifting currents.",
            "There\u2019s less data in the North Pacific and in the subtropics, but both are now starting to show an important shift away from large diatoms towards dinoflagellates, says Ostle. These smaller creatures are less nutritious; fish have to work harder to eat more of them. \u201cThat could have really big implications for the fisheries. We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "Dinoflagellates are also the plankton responsible for bioluminescence \u2014 and, sometimes, for generating biotoxins that lead to shellfish poisoning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting big bioluminescent blooms off of Southern California,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty if you go out for a walk on the beach at night and the waves are all lighting up, but they also have toxins,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they [dinoflagellates] are going to be one of the winners too, in in the future warmer ocean.\u201d",

In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature took the step of classing the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) as critically endangered. Around the same time, the European Union adopted a comprehensive eel regulation establishing measures to support the recovery of the stock, including through seasonal fishing closures and limits.",

The tiny, transparent, larvae are then carried on the current to Europe\u2019s Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs.

            "The eel\u2019s mysterious life cycle resists standard fisheries science. To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

But they are struggling to come up with solutions, since the reasons for the European eel\u2019s collapse are not straightforward. Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980. There are clearly a number of factors at play in this long decline, but the extent of each is uncertain.",
            "Overfishing, it seems, is only one piece of the puzzle, as shown by the failure of the EU\u2019s fishing regulations to produce a recovery. Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle. The recent surge of illegal trafficking of juveniles to Asia has surely put another dent in the population.",

This seems unlikely given that a 2023 committee vote on a resolution calling for renewed commitment to the regulation won the support of 80 percent of delegates present. \u201cThere\u2019s no will to do a ban, and also it wouldn\u2019t help,\u201d Andrew Kerr, the chair of a nonprofit coalition of conservationists, scientists, and commercial fishermen called the Sustainable Eel Group (SEG), told me over video call from his home in England. \u201cThe eel is much more complex than that, and if you stop fishing, you\u2019re not going to save the eel. What you need is a very controlled level of fishing, but we have to work on all the environmental factors.\u201d",
            "Durif acknowledges that the EU still needs some convincing from the scientific community before it will accept a zero-catch limit. \u201cThe EU is working on making a special request to ICES to see if we can measure the efficiency of the regulation, which we keep on saying we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

            "The mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",

In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",
            "BQIn Sweden, the threat of hydropower plants to migrating eels is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing.",
            "Eel fishermen around Europe fear their livelihoods being put on hold by a fishing ban, and they argue that the authorities should be addressing other known mortality factors. In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years. The population numbers continue to go down; soon we risk going underneath the survival threshold of the species.\u201d"

JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company.

            "Ten years ago, I walked with Yazar along the banks of Tigris at the antique settlement of Hasankeyf in Turkey. A local shepherd named \u00c7oban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf, once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels \u2014 a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory \u2014 were soon to be erased.",

            "About 20 million students in the United States ride to school each day on the familiar yellow bus. The vast majority of the nation\u2019s roughly 490,000 school buses \u2014 which comprise the nation\u2019s largest public-transportation fleet \u2014 are powered by diesel engines. \u201cWe\u2019re poisoning our kids on the way to school,\u201d said Jessica Keithan, cofounder and director of the Texas Electric School Bus Project, of the exhaust that inevitably infiltrates bus interiors and children\u2019s lungs.",
            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",

            "fCChildren aboard an electric school bus in Chevy Chase, Maryland, last February.\nTom Brenner / AP Photo.",
            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/19371586/embed",
            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

            "Still, he calls green infrastructure \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d because managing water where it falls protects water bodies from contaminants like bacteria, heavy metals, and trash, and it reduces the risk of basement backups. \u201cYou have to have both,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Despite its limited finances and aging infrastructure, Milwaukee\u2019s sewerage district has set a goal of eliminating combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2035. \u201cWith the changing climate we\u2019re facing,\u201d Shafer has said, \u201cit\u2019s like running uphill, and the hill keeps getting steeper and steeper.\u201d\n",
            "Boston, too, has emphasized gray infrastructure in its efforts to upgrade stormwater management. The city is operating under a long-term control plan \u2014 a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be \u201cfishable and swimmable.\u201d To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",
            "BQAlexandria\u2019s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four.",
            "But according to Max Rome, stormwater program manager for the nonprofit Charles River Watershed Association, the control plan\u2019s current goal may be impossible to meet. In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan.",
            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn\u2019t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.\u201d\n",
            "In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050\u2019s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That\u2019s above the watershed\u2019s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet.\n",
            "Increased rainfall is also affecting Western cities, including Portland, Oregon, which sharply reduced pollution in the downtown section of the Willamette River and Columbia Slough by building three tunnels to hold stormwater flows. The project, which nearly eliminated CSOs, took 20 years to complete, in 2011, and cost $1.4 billion.",

            "The 2.2-mile-long tunnel, completed at a cost of $615 million but not due to begin operating until early 2026, will reduce sewage and stormwater overflows into the Potomac River from 140 million gallons a year, between 2000 and 2016, to 17 million gallons a year, said Justin Carl, chief executive of AlexRenew, the city\u2019s public wastewater treatment authority. Alexandria\u2019s new tunnel is designed to reduce the number of overflows per year from 70, during the 2000 to 2016 period, to four.",
            "The project includes some green infrastructure, like bioretention basins and tree wells that filter and retain stormwater runoff. But the agency decided to limit those measures because most of its CSOs occur in the oldest part of the city, which has little open space and clayey soils, which have a slow infiltration rate when moist.",
            "BQOnly one site in Washington was suitable for nature-based solutions because it had low overflow and wasn\u2019t densely developed.",
            "A much larger stormwater project is planned for the nation\u2019s capital, where DC Water, an independent local-government authority, is building an 18-mile network of tunnels to hold 249 million gallons of stormwater and sewage until it can be safely pumped to a treatment plant. When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",
            "Green infrastructure is just a small part of the overall project, costing $98 million out of a total budget of $3.29 billion, Wone said. The agency conducted green-infrastructure pilot projects at two sites and concluded that only one, in Rock Creek Park, was suitable for nature-based solutions because it had low overflow volumes and wasn\u2019t densely developed.\n",
            "Acknowledging the climate challenges faced by U.S. cities, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) in 2022 issued a 182-page report projecting a 9.5 percent increase in average annual rainfall by 2050, over the 1997-2017 baseline, and stated that stormwater management projects \u2014 whether gray or green \u2014 must be upgraded to reflect that scenario.",

            "Since that landmark study, more than 7,000 papers have come out about microplastics, including one coauthored by Thompson that was published in Science last month and warned that the tiny particles pose a growing biological threat to many species, including humans. The rate of global plastic production has roughly doubled in the last two decades. Without action at a global level, Thompson has written, plastic production could triple by 2060.",

I started asking the question, \u201cWhat are the smallest pieces?\u201d My students went out on the beach, and they brought back samples of sand. When we looked at them with a microscope, we saw pieces that didn\u2019t look like sand, that turned out to be plastic. We discovered that microplastics, including many smaller than the diameter of a human hair, contaminated waters around the U.K.",
            "In a 2004 paper published in Science, we showed that they were biologically available to a range of marine organisms. We also showed, using archived samples, that the abundance of these small fragments, which we named microplastics, had increased significantly since the 1960s. ",

And it wasn\u2019t until our 2004 paper that this really started to attract attention.

The packets, the bottles, all of those things will fragment over time into smaller and smaller pieces.

And neither did I see it from surface trawl data. But the reason I believe is that we weren\u2019t yet recording the small bits, so we were missing a fraction.

But it declined to answer questions from Yale Environment 360 about whether it supports the ruling or will help to implement it.",
            "But a Batwa elder now based in Bukavu near the park, who answered on condition of anonymity, explained why the ruling was so important to the tribe. \u201cOur traditional lands in the park are numerous, because each clan has its own hills. Among these hills, there are sacred sites where we communicated with the ancestors and communed with the forest, which we consider to be the nourishing mother. These lands our are identity. To deprive us of them is to exterminate us.\u201d \n",
            "\nThe African Commission\u2019s ruling is legally significant. It finds that the DRC government has violated 11 articles on human rights in the African Charter, to which it is a signatory. These include the rights of the Batwa to life, property, natural resources, development, health, religion, and culture. And it calls on the government to adopt into law as soon as possible \u201can effective mechanism for the delimitation, demarcation and titling of the territory traditionally occupied by the Batwa and the various natural resources attached to it in accordance with their tradition,\u201d and to annul all laws \u201cprohibiting the presence of the Batwa on ancestral lands and the enjoyment of the fruits of these lands.\u201d",

            "The African Union has endorsed the commission\u2019s decision, but it is far from clear how the Congolese government will respond. According to an attorney based in Bukavu, who is part-Batwa and has been following the case closely, the government has all along attempted to thwart the commission\u2019s investigation. \u201cIt has never responded to correspondence addressed to it by the Commission, nor appeared before it, even though it is a signatory member of the African Charter.\u201d (Neither the commission nor the DRC government has responded to requests for comment.)",

",
            "The forced eviction of Indigenous people, such as the Batwa, from their ancestral lands across Africa has been widespread for decades. Usually carried out in the name of conservation, it has in the past often been planned, helped, and funded by Western conservation groups such as the WCS and World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

Development Programme concluded that WWF had for years funded park guards that it knew inflicted violence on Baka people in the region\u2019s parks. The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization\u2019s work in the region.",
            "The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians \u2014 more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them.",
            "The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month \u2014 signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists \u2014 contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not \u201cdetract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d noting their \u201clands include more than one-third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes.\u201d",

            "So the ruling by the African Commission on the land rights of the Batwa in the Kahuzi-Biega National Park, an epitome of attempted fortress conservation, is being seen by many as a wider adjudication.",
            "Leaving aside its symbolic importance, the Kahuzi-Biega park is an important biodiversity hotspot. Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas. UNESCO made it a World Heritage Site and calls it \u201cone of the ecologically richest regions of Africa.\u201d",
            "But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

            "Many armed groups stayed on after the civil wars, setting up crude mining operations for coltan (used in cellphones and personal computers), cassiterite (tin ore), and gold. Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",
            "BQ\u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that \u201cpark guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.\u201d",
            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas. The result, he says, is \u201cthousands of hectares of deforestation,\u201d visible in satellite images.",

            "Simpson accuses human rights lobbyists of having an \u201coverly idealized image of the Batwa as ecologically noble savages.\u201d Even so, he says the Batwa are minor players in a wider economy of ecological destruction. The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides \u201cideal hideouts\u201d for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is \u201cthe only feasible form of enforcement.\u201d",
            "But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",
            "\u201cDoes the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

I realized that I lived in a community that was surrounded by billion-dollar industries that had very little resources for people who looked like me. I got on Facebook and asked, \u201cWho needs help?\u201d So many people needed food. They needed water. People were newly homeless.",
            "I was looking at the connections between industrial pollution, the storms that were happening across Louisiana and Texas, and the proposed industry coming along the Gulf Coast. I was beginning to recognize how all of this was connected when I heard about these 20 proposed LNG terminals. My first question was, \u201cWhere are they going to go?\u201d I had this overwhelming feeling that they were going to push out more Black communities.

I get a few small grants from organizations, but a lot of the funding comes from crowdsourcing from across the U.S. I assist people with food, shelter, water, clothing, paying their utility bills, paying their rent. But then they come to our community outreach meetings, they protest. [In late June] I was able to organize over 200 people from Texas and Louisiana to march with over 1,000 people down Wall Street to tell banks to stop funding environmental racism in our communities. I can\u2019t talk to a person in my community about CP2 coming when they can\u2019t feed their families, when they can\u2019t pay their rent.

            "Ozane: I\u2019m originally from Mississippi. When we first came to Louisiana in 2003, I immediately knew that those industries were bad because we could see the fires and the smoke. The air smelled like rotten eggs one day and like Clorox the next. It made me sick. One of my sisters who worked at a petrochemical plant ended up being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. Her job was to watch the flare to see how big or small it would be, but she didn\u2019t know what was coming out of that thing.\n",
            "Three of my children have eczema, and two have asthma. My son was recently diagnosed with epilepsy. He started having seizures last year, at the age of 17. He had his first seizure while driving between two facilities that had flares going. Those flares are loud, they are bright, and those are seizure-triggering things. It was also a couple days after the explosion at [a local refinery]. I tried to get answers, but everybody I talked to said that the chemicals released from these facilities disappear out of your blood quickly.\n",

            "Ozane: There have been studies done by Tulane and LSU, but the studies I\u2019ve seen have been paid for by industry and are biased. The state of Louisiana has said that even though cancer rates are going up, there is no way to say that they\u2019re going up because industry has grown. Louisiana is third in the nation for cancer rates. People hear about Cancer Alley, not understanding that the entire state of Louisiana is a cancer state.

The Vessel Project fought coal in Westlake, Louisiana, and right behind coal came LNG. And right behind LNG, now, you have [new] petrochemical plants.
