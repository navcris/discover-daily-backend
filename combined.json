            "Growing immature eggs from old mice in the ovarian structures of young mice can reverse signs of ageing in the eggs1.",
            "\u201cThink of this as a five-star anti-ageing spa for the old egg,\u201d says Rong Li, a cell biologist at the National University of Singapore (NUS), who co-authored a study describing the results.",
            "When the rejuvenated eggs were fertilized, the resulting embryos were almost four times more likely to give rise to healthy pups than the eggs that matured in the old environment. The results are published in Nature Aging today.",

            "In mammalian ovaries, ovarian structures, known as follicles, house a maturing egg, called an oocyte. Once developed, these pop out as eggs, ready for fertilization. But with age, the number and quality of oocytes decline. Researchers have investigated the role of oocyte ageing in infertility2, but Li and her colleague Wang HaiYang, also a cell biologist at NUS, focused on ageing follicles.",
            "The latest study offers the \u201cfirst solid, strong evidence\u201d that follicles can improve the quality of maturing eggs, says Suzannah Williams, an ovarian biologist at the University of Oxford, UK. They\u2019ve \u201cdone a fantastic job\u201d.",
            "h2Old to young",
            "The researchers swapped out oocytes from 14-month-old mice that were close to becoming infertile and placed them into the follicles of 2-month-old mice, which were in their reproductive prime \u2014 and vice versa.",
            "They found that the quality of old oocytes improved when grown in young follicles compared with those grown in old follicles. Specifically, after the youthful treatment, the oocytes had fewer chromosomal abnormalities, improved mitochondrial function and their gene expression and metabolite-production profiles better resembled those of young oocytes.",
            "Meanwhile, young oocytes grown in old follicles showed increased signs of ageing.",
            "The researchers fertilized the eggs and transferred them into surrogate mice. Embryos that came from rejuvenated oocytes were significantly more likely to give rise to a pup than old oocytes grown in old follicles. However, the success rate didn\u2019t reach that of pups that arose from young oocytes grown in young follicles.",
            "The results suggests that oocyte ageing is partially reversible, and that the surrounding cellular environment plays an important part in the process, says Li.",
            "h2More connections",
            "The researchers took a closer look at what could be driving oocyte revival. Tunnel-like structures that connect follicles to oocytes, known as transzonal projections (TZPs), pump important molecules for nourishing oocytes. The researchers found a higher density of TZPs in old oocytes embedded in young follicles compared with those embedded in old follicles.",
            "If the findings translate to people, Li suggests that this could lead to cell therapies that improve egg quality in older people.",
            "But Williams says that this translation will be tricky, given the difficulties of acquiring sufficient donor tissue and growing them for long enough in the laboratory. Still, she says \u201cit\u2019s a proof of concept\u201d.",

            "The warnings come off the back of one of the largest studies1 of viruses harboured by fur animals in China. The team, which included Holmes, found a broad array of viruses \u2014 including new pathogens and known ones found in new hosts. The study was published in Nature on Wednesday.",
            "Researchers have long suspected that these animals are a reservoir of viruses that can jump to people, says Alice Hughes, a conservation biologist at the University of Hong Kong. The analysis \u201chighlights that these concerns are valid, and that the diversity of viruses with known risks to humans is even greater than was realized\u201d. Hughes says the industry should mandate transitioning to artificial fur.",
            "The other option is to improve regulation and oversight of the fur trade, says Hughes. This includes ensuring the implementation of measures such as animal quarantines, reducing overcrowding and rules around cleaning cages, sourcing feed and waste disposal, she says.",
            "Linfa Wang, a virologist at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, says the animal-farming and animal-trading industries need to be monitored closely for emerging diseases.",
            "Mark Oaten, chief executive of the International Fur Federation in London, which represents farms in more than 40 countries, says farms should operate under the highest biosecurity standards. \u201cThe prevention and surveillance measures undertaken by fur farmers continue being the best toolbox to further mitigate any risk for the general public\u2019s health,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Global industry",
            "Fur farming is a global industry, although most farms are found in Europe and China. In 2016, farms in Europe produced 39.05 million mink pelts; Chinese farms produced 26.16 million such pelts.",
            "Many animals farmed for their fur are susceptible to human viruses. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 spread through mink farms across Europe. But Oaten says studies of these outbreaks found that farmers were not driving the spread of the virus in the general population, and that prevention and surveillance measures implemented by farmers are \u201cthe best toolbox to further mitigate any risk for the general public health.\u201d",
            "Mink farms have also had outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus. And a popular fur animal, the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), could have played a part in bringing the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome to people in 20032. Raccoon dogs are also susceptible to, and can spread, SARS-CoV-23.",
            "Holmes and his colleagues, including several in China, sought to identify the viruses circulating in farms in China. They swabbed lung and gut tissue samples for 461 animals that died between 2021 and 2024. Of these animals, 164 came from four species farmed exclusively for fur: mink (Neogale vison), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and raccoon dog. The individuals were predominantly from intensive breeding facilities in northeastern China. The rest came from farmed and wild animals used for fur as well as food and traditional medicine, spread more broadly across eastern China. These included guinea pigs, deer and rabbits. The animals had all been sick and had probably died of an infectious disease.",
            "The researchers sequenced RNA and DNA in the tissue samples and found a trove of viruses: 125 were identified in total, including many influenza viruses and coronaviruses.",
            "Of these, 36 had never been seen before, and many were found in species not previously known to host them. For instance, they found the Japanese encephalitis virus in guinea pigs and norovirus in mink.",
            "h2Human receptor",
            "The researchers found an H6N2 avian influenza virus in a muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) \u2014 the first known identification of this subtype in mammals. And most notably, they found in mink a HKU5-like coronavirus related to viruses that have so far been identified only in bats \u2014 evidence that fur farms can act as a highway for viruses lurking in wild animals to get to people.",
            "These viruses \u201cstand out to me the most\u201d, says Michael Letko, a molecular virologist at Washington State University in Pullman. Studies in Letko\u2019s laboratory have shown that some HKU5 viruses might be able to adapt to the human ACE2 receptor to enter cells4, just as certain viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, do. \u201cA deeper dive into these newly discovered viruses will be important, in order to understand their risk to other animals,\u201d he says.",
            "The researchers classified some three dozen viruses as most concerning, because of their ability to jump between species. Raccoon dogs and mink each carried ten of these high-risk viruses \u2014 the most of any species.",
            "Wang says the findings need to be corroborated with epidemiological studies to assess how widespread the viruses are, and infection studies in the lab, which can demonstrate the risk of these viruses infecting people. Even without that evidence, he says, the highest risk of a new pathogen emerging in people \u201cis in the animal industry\u201d.",

            "Pathoplexus \u2014 a portmanteau of pathogen and plexus \u2014 was launched last month, and the team of scientists behind the database hopes that it will encourage more researchers to share genetic sequences of known and emerging viruses of public-health importance.",
            "Sharing sequences as quickly as possible is important for identifying new viruses and tracking changes that could make them more dangerous to humans, as well as for designing vaccines, says Edward Holmes, a virologist at the University of Sydney in Australia.",
            "Pathoplexus currently focuses on four viruses that are not specifically included in other databases: Crimean\u2013Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Ebola Sudan, Ebola Zaire and West Nile Virus. Other pathogens will be added later, the team says.",
            "h2Existing hurdles",
            "Among the largest existing repositories is GenBank in the United States, which offers unrestricted access to its genomic data. But public access means that anyone can theoretically use the data to publish scientific papers, without acknowledging the data owners. This has discouraged scientists, particularly those from lower-income countries, from sharing their data quickly, such as during a public-health emergency. An alternative repository, GISAID, requires users to register, agree to acknowledge the data owners and make their best efforts to collaborate with the owners. The database was designed to ensure the rights of data submitters.",
            "GISAID was hugely popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it contains close to 17 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. But researchers have raised concerns around transparency in its governance, how it mediates disputes over credit and how it sanctions those it thinks to have violated its conditions for use.",
            "\u201cGISAID has led to a lot of frustration in the past few years,\u201d but the scientific community has also learnt lessons on how to do things better, says Spyros Lytras, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Tokyo. \u201cStarting from scratch is what we need as a community, and Pathoplexus might be the solution.\u201d",
            "A representative for GISAID said in an e-mail that the trust it has with the scientific community is strong, and that more than 70,000 researchers use the site. The roles of its governing bodies and funding sources are displayed on its website, and their terms of use haven\u2019t changed since it was founded in 2008, the representative said.",
            "h2Building trust",
            "Pathoplexus offers some protections for users. For instance, researchers can set restrictions on how their data are used, such as not allowing them to be included as a key focus of scientific publications for up to a year without their explicit permission. This should give data owners enough time to submit a manuscript on their findings.",
            "Users must also credit the data owners in their publications. \u201cWe aim to build a community where researchers feel confident that their contributions will be respected and properly credited,\u201d says Jamie Southgate, a member of Pathoplexus and the head of operations at the global coalition Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology, based in Cape Town, South Africa.",
            "Pathoplexus doesn\u2019t block individuals who breach the terms of use from accessing the site, which GISAID has done in rare cases. Instead, if published data breach the terms, the team will approach the journals to ensure that the data are used in accordance with the way in which they were shared, says Emma Hodcroft, a co-founder of Pathoplexus and a molecular epidemiologist at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, Switzerland. \u201cWe have tried to be incredibly explicit\u201d about the terms, she says.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a good, clever solution,\u201d says Senjuti Saha, a molecular microbiologist at the Child Health Research Foundation in Dhaka, who agrees with the approach of reaching out to publishers. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d She thinks that Pathoplexus\u2019s transparency will breed trust among the scientific community.",
            "But it\u2019s too early to say whether the repository will solve the current data-sharing problems, says Saha. \u201cIt is an excellent and fantastic first step.\u201d",
            "Users might also stick to sharing sequences on local databases. For instance, in China, researchers are probably more likely to publish sequences for emerging viruses on Chinese databases, says Shi Mang, an evolutionary biologist at Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, China, who is also on Pathoplexus\u2019s scientific advisory board. But for established viruses, they are likely to use repositories with well-maintained collections, which Pathoplexus offers.",
            "h2Improved experience",
            "Pathoplexus\u2019s creators have tried to improve the user experience, such as making uploading as easy as possible. Pathoplexus also checks for errors in the sequence data and accompanying information and assists with organizing viruses into subtypes. \u201cThis is actually what attracted me to this database,\u201d says Shi. Incorrect sequences in current repositories can cause lots of trouble for researchers, he says.",
            "So far, Pathoplexus has used GenBank data for the four viruses to populate the site. Thousands of people have visited the site, and 50 have created accounts to submit data, but none have submitted sequences, says Hodcroft. \u201cWe did not expect high volumes of data for the pathogens that we\u2019ve launched with.\u201d",
            "Researchers who work on other viruses will have to wait until the database expands to include them. And to expand, the team needs to secure long-term funding. The site is currently being run by volunteers and donated computing time, which ends in about six months. Hodcroft says her priority right now is to appeal to donors. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously hopeful.\u201d",

Applying the dye to the skin of live mice allowed scientists to peer through tissues at the structures below, including blood vessels and internal organs. The method, described in Science on 6 September1, could offer a less invasive way to monitor live animals used in medical research.",

            "The technique works by changing how body tissues that are normally opaque interact with light. The fluids, fats and proteins that make up tissues such as skin and muscle have different refractive indices (a measurement of how much a material bends light): aqueous components have low refractive indices, whereas lipids and proteins have high ones. Tissues appear opaque because the contrast between these refractive indices causes light to be scattered. The researchers speculated that adding a dye that strongly absorbs light to such tissues could narrow the gap between the components\u2019 refractive indices enough to make them transparent.",

The team used theoretical physics to predict how certain molecules would alter how mouse tissues interacted with light. Several candidates emerged, but the team focused on tartrazine, or FD&C Yellow 5, a common dye used in many processed foods. \u201cWhen tartrazine is dissolved in water, it makes water bend light more like fats do,\u201d says Hong. A tissue containing fluids and lipids becomes transparent when the dye is added, because the light refraction of fluids matches that of lipids.",

They then massaged the dye into various areas of a live mouse\u2019s skin. Applying the dye to the scalp allowed the team to scrutinize tiny zigzags of blood vessels; putting it on the abdomen offered a clear view of the mouse\u2019s intestines contracting with digestion, and revealed other movements tied to breathing. The team also used the solution on the mouse\u2019s leg, and were able to discern muscle fibres beneath the skin.",
            "\n\nTransparent tissues bring cells into focus for microscopy\n",
            "The technique can make tissues transparent only to a depth of around 3 millimetres, so it is currently of limited practical use for thicker tissues and larger animals.",
            "But because tartrazine is a food dye, it is safe to use on living mice, and the method is reversible \u2014 when the dye is rinsed off, the skin simply returns to being opaque. This offers a huge advantage over existing methods of making tissue transparent, which are not typically suitable for live animals, and often involve using chemicals to change the refractive index of certain tissue components, or to remove them all together.",
            "The fact that the method produces transparency, is reversible and can be used on live animals \u201cis going to make it an obvious thing that that many people would want to use\u201d, Keller says. Among other applications, he thinks it could be useful in mouse models that aim to understand the nervous system and neurodegenerative diseases.",

For instance, because wildfires have worsened in Canada, there are now \u201csix weeks of the year where it\u2019s too smoky and hot to let my kid go outside, and my kid has asthma\u201d, Burgess says. She remembers only a handful of smoky days when she was growing up, so she shares that experience to help people process the changes they are seeing.",

Using this strategy with climate change specifically is still being systematically tested.",

            "The smell in the laboratory was new. It was, in the language of the business, tenacious: for more than a week, the odour clung to the paper on which it had been blotted.",
            "To researcher Alex Wiltschko, it was the smell of summertime in Texas: watermelon, but more precisely, the boundary where the red flesh transitions into white rind.",
            "\u201cIt was a molecule that nobody had ever seen before,\u201d says Wiltschko, who runs a company called Osmo, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His team created the compound, called 533, as part of its mission to understand and digitize smell. His goal \u2014 to develop a system that can detect, predict or create odours \u2014 is a tall order, as molecule 533 shows. \u201cIf you looked at the structure, you would never have guessed that it smelled this way.\u201d",
            "That\u2019s one of the problems with understanding smell: the chemical structure of a molecule tells you almost nothing about its odour. Two chemicals with very similar structures can smell wildly different; and two wildly different chemical structures can produce an almost identical odour. And most smells \u2014 coffee, Camembert, ripe tomatoes \u2014 are mixtures of many tens or hundreds of aroma molecules, intensifying the challenge of understanding how chemistry gives rise to olfactory experience.",
            "Another problem is working out how smells relate to each other. With vision, the spectrum is a simple colour palette: red, green, blue and all their swirling intermediates. Sounds have a frequency and a volume, but for smell there are no obvious parameters. Where does an odour identifiable as \u2018frost\u2019 sit in relation to \u2018sauna\u2019? It\u2019s a real challenge to make predictions about smell, says Joel Mainland, a neuroscientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, an independent research institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",
            "\n\nHow do we smell? First 3D structure of human odour receptor offers clues\n",
            "Animals, including humans, have evolved a remarkably complex decoding system befitting the enormous repertoire of odour molecules. All sensory information is processed by receptors, and odour is no different \u2014 except in its scale. For light, the human eye has two types of receptor cell; for smell, there are 400. How the signals from these receptors combine to trigger a particular perception is unclear. Plus, the receptor proteins themselves are hard to work with, so what they look like and how they function has mostly been guesswork.",
            "Things are beginning to change, however, thanks to improvements in structural biology, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Many scientists hope that cracking the olfactory code will help them to understand how animals use this essential sense to find food or mates, and how it feeds into memory, emotion, stress, appetite and more.",
            "Others are trying to digitize smell to build new technologies: devices that diagnose disease on the basis of odours; better, safer insect repellents; and affordable or more-effective aroma molecules for the US$30-billion flavour and fragrance market. At least 20 start-up firms are trying to make electronic noses for applications in health and public safety.",
            "This all adds up to a surge of research into the biology of olfaction, says Sandeep Robert Datta, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cSmell is having a moment,\u201d he says.",

            "Researchers have come up with a few computational models that can relate structure to odour, but early versions tended to be based on quite narrow data sets or could only make predictions when smells had been calibrated to have the same perceived intensity. In 2020, one team reported a model that could predict how similar real-world mixtures were to each other, correctly identifying that rose and violet odorants are more similar to one another than either is to the pungent spice asafoetida, often used in Indian cuisine1.",
            "Previous attempts to use machine learning were good, but not great. For example, when researchers ran a competition to create the best odour-predicting model, algorithms from 22 teams could effectively predict only 8 out of 19 smell descriptors2.",
            "\n\nCould rats and dogs detect disease better than the finest lab equipment?\n",

            "Their program was trained by feeding the model thousands of descriptions of molecular structures from fragrance catalogues, along with smell labels for each \u2014 terms such as \u2018beefy\u2019 or \u2018floral\u2019.",
            "Then, the researchers compared the AI system with human noses. They trained 15 panellists to rate a few hundred aromas using 55 labels, such as \u2018smoky\u2019, \u2018tropical\u2019 and \u2018waxy\u2019.",
            "Humans have a hard time with this task because smell is so subjective. \u201cThere\u2019s no universal truth,\u201d says Mainland. Most smell descriptions lack detail, too. For one smell, panellists chose the words \u2018sharp, sweet, roasted, buttery\u2019. A master perfumer, asked to describe the same smell, noted \u2018ski lodge, fireplace without a fire\u2019. \u201cThat shows you the gap,\u201d says Mainland. \u201cOur lexicon is not good enough.\u201d Nonetheless, a human panel is one of the best available tools for coming up with consistent smell descriptors because the average rankings of the group for different smells tend to be stable.",
            "Using the structure of these molecules alone, the AI algorithm did well at predicting the smell of compounds compared with the average group assessments (see \u2018Same but different\u2019), and it performed better than the typical individual sniffer.

Another goal is to have the model design new odours, for instance chemicals that mimic a specific scent, or that are safer, more sustainable or biodegradable.",

But the expertise and ingenuity of human chemists and flavourists \u2014 plus their highly trained noses \u2014 will still be necessary for innovation.",

            "For both expert and amateur sniffers, the biological equipment for smell detection is the same. The nose has millions of olfactory neurons, and each typically expresses just one type of odorant receptor (OR). The gene family that encodes them was discovered4 in the early 1990s and won Linda Buck and Richard Axel a Nobel prize in 2004.",
            "Each of these receptor types might recognize one or more odorants \u2014 and each odorant might be recognized by more than one receptor. Together, the roughly 400 human ORs can respond to a trillion different chemicals. It\u2019s a fiendishly complex, exquisitely tuned, flexible system \u2014 and it needs to be, because the chemistry of nature is incredibly diverse, says Aashish Manglik, a biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThe breadth of chemicals that make odours is enormous.\u201d One important step in cracking the code of smell is to know what the receptors look like and how they recognize chemicals. But they have been notoriously difficult to study. \u201cThey\u2019re the most recalcitrant membrane proteins to work with,\u201d says Manglik. Many are too unstable to be expressed in cells in the lab and to generate enough protein to analyse.",
            "Scientists have deciphered the structure of two ORs from insects5,6. These receptors are of a totally different type to those in mammals, although the olfactory \u2018logic\u2019 by which they work together is likely to be similar, says sensory neuroscientist Vanessa Ruta, whose lab at the Rockefeller University in New York solved both the structures.",
            "Two more receptor structures7,8, from the olfactory system in mice, followed last year. Both of them sense a bunch of chemicals with distinctly unlikeable fishy, musky or putrid odours, many of which are key components of bodily odours in animals.",
            "Getting at these structures has required some \u201cfunky approaches\u201d, says Manglik, because ORs are so hard to grow in the lab. But last year, he was part of a team that succeeded in publishing the first protein structure of a human olfactory receptor bound to an odorant9.",
            "Having tried almost every OR that they could, Manglik and colleagues found one that is richly expressed outside the nose, in the gut and prostate, and which could, as a result, be made more readily in commonly used cell lines. It\u2019s a receptor called OR51E2 and it responds to the chemical propionate, which has a pungent, cheesy odour.",

            "Using cryo-electron microscopy, the team looked at how propionate binds to the receptor in a little pocket, and how that binding changes the receptor\u2019s shape and conveys information onwards. Seeing the structure \u201cwas really thrilling\u201d, says Buck, whose lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington, studies olfactory neuroscience.",
            "But ORs can detect so many odorants that \u201cthe structure of one OR can\u2019t tell us much\u201d, says Hiro Matsunami, an olfaction biologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who collaborated with Manglik on the study of OR51E2.",
            "Alongside trying to grow more of them, Matsunami and his colleagues have attempted to understand the OR by re-engineering it. They made some synthetic receptors using OR51E2 and parts from two dozen similar receptors. They aligned the amino-acid sequences of these existing ORs, and chose the most frequent amino acid at each position to build an average, or \u2018consensus\u2019, structure. Then they expressed the structure in cells. When they compared their synthetic structure with its real-life counterpart, OR51E2, it looked and behaved just like its sibling10.",
            "Next, they tried building another averaged receptor based on an OR with no published structure \u2014 OR1A1 \u2014 which recognizes a broad range of odorants including some that smell fruity, floral and minty. They used a computational model to explore how it bound to two compounds that both smell of menthol; the compounds bound to the receptor in different places.",
            "The team thinks that different odorants probably engage a single OR in distinct ways. That would help to explain the level of complexity in the smell code \u2014 and could explain why, for example, two disparate chemicals can have similar odours, or why chemically similar compounds can smell so different. The compound carvone, for instance, comes in two varieties that are mirror images of each other; one smells of spearmint, the other of caraway or dill. \u201cThere must be a receptor that can explain this,\u201d says Matsunami.",
            "Some researchers are using machine learning to accelerate the search for structures and their preferred chemical partners. Right now, scientists have identified odour molecules that bind to only about 20% of human ORs.",
            "The protein-prediction algorithm AlphaFold has suggested thousands of structures for mammalian odorant receptors11. And machine learning and modelling has helped Matsunami and his colleagues to screen millions of compounds to see which ones might bind to two candidate OR structures12. One of the molecules they found smells of orange blossom; another strongly of honey.",
            "The dream end point is to gather data on hundreds of ORs and how their activation lines up with the chemistry of millions of odorants, says Manglik.",
            "h2Lead with the nose",
            "Once a smell is processed by receptors, this information proceeds to a brain region called the olfactory bulb, which sits behind the bridge of the nose, and onwards to the olfactory cortex. The circuitry for olfaction before information enters the cortex is well understood, particularly in model organisms such as fruit flies and mice. But the olfactory cortex is more of a mystery. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to figure out what\u2019s happening there,\u201d says Buck.",
            "Many researchers want to understand how information from receptors is organized in the brain, and what rules govern perception. If that were understood, it might be possible to get an animal to perceive a certain smell without even presenting an odorant, simply by recreating the pattern it generates in the brain, says Dima Rinberg, a neuroscientist who studies smell at New York University School of Medicine.",
            "\n\nHuman nose can detect 1 trillion odours\n",
            "Another big unknown, Datta says, is how the olfactory system interacts with other crucial brain circuits, such as those that control movement or navigation. Several labs, including his own, are interested in how animals actively sense scent and move towards or away from odours.",
            "Capturing the connection between scent and behaviour is already possible to some extent in the brains of insects. In fruit flies, for instance, scientists can explore chemical structure, receptors and the brain in a single system. \u201cIn insects you can start to span the whole spectrum,\u201d says Ruta.",
            "Insects\u2019 sense of smell is also relevant to human health. Mosquitoes evolved to sniff out humans, and many insects prey on crops that humans rely on. Last November, Osmo announced a $3.5-million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, aimed at discovering and producing compounds that repel, attract or destroy insects that carry disease.",
            "Meanwhile, detecting scents is also big business. For some tasks and applications, \u2018electronic noses\u2019 are already commercially available: some are designed to detect off odours in food or to pick up smells in waste water. They are being intensively studied as diagnostics for diseases such as TB, diabetes and various cancers.",
            "But natural sniffers still have an edge, and even without a full understanding of how brains process smell, scientists can exploit biological noses to improve chemical sensing for safety, security or health care.",
            "The classic example is the sniffer dog, widely used to sense chemicals in explosives or narcotics \u2014 but these animals are expensive to train and there are limits to what they can detect.",
            "Rinberg\u2019s team is aiming to blend animal and digital odour detection. They developed a nose\u2013computer interface in mice13, using electrodes that record signals from the olfactory bulb as mice smell different compounds. The researchers can decode odour identities from neural activity, and then use the patterns to flag these smells under natural conditions. Their device, which is now being developed by a start-up called Canaery, co-founded by Rinberg, retains the precision of the animal\u2019s sense of smell without researchers having to train the animal to respond. \u201cThe biological nose is the best chemical detector,\u201d Rinberg says. \u201cThe whole machinery is hard to beat.\u201d",
            "Despite the pre-eminence of biology, many scientists dream of a time when a digital smell sensor will rival those for other senses. \u201cSmartphones can do image and audio recognition,\u201d says Ruta. \u201cBut for olfaction there\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d",
            "And although they know how well biological noses work, researchers still have a lot of outstanding questions. For Buck, the simplest to pose could be the most difficult to answer. \u201cIt would be nice to know how you get a perception of a particular odorant,\u201d she says \u2014 how the brain, beyond the nose, creates a sense of rose, for instance, and how it distinguishes it from the essence of fish. \u201cHow does that happen in the brain? No one knows,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the techniques to figure that out yet.\u201d",

            "The fastest supercomputer in the world is a machine known as Frontier, but even this speedster with nearly 50,000 processors has its limits. On a sunny Monday in April, its power consumption is spiking as it tries to keep up with the amount of work requested by scientific groups around the world.",
            "The electricity demand peaks at around 27 megawatts, enough to power roughly 10,000 houses, says Bronson Messer, director of science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where Frontier is located. With a note of pride in his voice, Messer uses a local term to describe the supercomputer\u2019s work rate: \u201cThey are running the machine like a scalded dog.\u201d",
            "Frontier churns through data at record speed, outpacing 100,000 laptops working simultaneously. When it debuted in 2022, it was the first to break through supercomputing\u2019s exascale speed barrier \u2014 the capability of executing an exaflop, or 1018 floating point operations per second. The Oak Ridge behemoth is the latest chart-topper in a decades-long global trend of pushing towards larger supercomputers (although it is possible that faster computers exist in military labs or otherwise secret facilities).",
            "\n\nHow cutting-edge computer chips are speeding up the AI revolution\n",
            "But speed and size are secondary to Frontier\u2019s main purpose \u2014 to push the bounds of human knowledge. Frontier excels at creating simulations that capture large-scale patterns with small-scale details, such as how tiny cloud droplets can affect the pace at which Earth\u2019s climate warms. Researchers are using the supercomputer to create cutting-edge models of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. Some projects are simulating proteins to help develop new drugs, modelling turbulence to improve aeroplane engine design and creating open-source large language models (LLMs) to compete with the artificial intelligence (AI) tools from Google and OpenAI.",
            "Researchers log on to Frontier from all over the world. In 2023, the supercomputer had 1,744 users in 18 countries. And, in 2024, Oak Ridge anticipates that Frontier users will publish at least 500 papers based on computations performed on the machine.",
            "\u201cFrontier is not unlike the James Webb Space Telescope,\u201d says biophysicist Dilip Asthagiri of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. \u201cWe should see it as a scientific instrument.\u201d",
            "h2Inside the machine",
            "The brains of Frontier reside in a warehouse-sized room filled with a steady electronic hum that is gentle enough to talk over. In the room are 74 identical glossy black racks that hold a total of 9,408 nodes. These are the workhorses of a supercomputer. Each node consists of four graphics processing units (GPUs) and one computer processing unit (CPU).",
            "A team of engineers continuously monitors the machine for signs of trouble, says Corey Edmonds, a technician at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the company that built the supercomputer. Edmonds, who is based at Oak Ridge, is doing maintenance surgery on Frontier on this day. After fixing a broken connector on one of the nodes, he squeezes grey thermal grease from a syringe on to a silvery rectangle \u2014 one of the node\u2019s four GPUs. This helps the GPU to dissipate heat quickly and stay cool.",
            "Frontier owes its speed mainly to its extensive use of GPUs. These chips, first developed to render realistic graphics for computer gamers, are now powering advances in AI through machine-learning applications.",
            "\u201cThey can run really fast,\u201d says Messer. \u201cThey\u2019re also abysmally stupid.\u201d GPUs excel at crunching many numbers at once \u2014 and not much else. \u201cThey can do one thing over and over and over and over again,\u201d he says, which makes them useful for speedy work in supercomputer calculations.",
            "Researchers have to customize their code to take advantage of Frontier\u2019s GPUs. Messer likens a scientist using Frontier for the first time to a suburban driver commandeering a race car. \u201cIt\u2019s got a steering wheel, gas pedal and a brake,\u201d he says. \u201cBut try to get a regular driver into a Formula One car and actually have them go from here to there.\u201d",
            "h2Big science",
            "It\u2019s not easy for researchers to get a chance to use Frontier. Messer and three colleagues are gathering on this April Monday to evaluate research proposals for the machine. On average, they approve around one in four proposals, and last year awarded time to 131 projects. In particular, applicants need to make the case that their project can take advantage of the supercomputer\u2019s entire system.",
            "The most common allocations they offer are around 500,000 node hours, equivalent to running the entire machine for three days continuously. Their largest allocation is four times bigger. Researchers who are granted time on Frontier get about ten times more computing resources than they can procure anywhere else, says Messer.",
            "Today, his team is doling out smaller awards of around 20,000 node hours, which it does on a weekly basis. Many projects take advantage of Frontier\u2019s ability to simultaneously model a wide range of spatial and time scales. In total, Frontier has about 65 million node-hours available each year.",

            "Scientists want to use Frontier, for example, to simulate atomically accurate biological processes, such as proteins or nucleic acids in solution interacting with other parts of cells.",
            "This May, Asthagiri and Nick Hagerty, a high-performance-computing engineer at Oak Ridge, used Frontier to simulate a cube-shaped drop of liquid water containing more than 155 billion water molecules. \u201cIt was to push the machine,\u201d says Asthagiri. The simulated cube is about one-tenth the width of a human hair, and the model is among the largest atomic-level simulations ever made, says Asthagiri, who has not yet published the work in a peer-reviewed journal.",
            "These initial simulations are building towards more ambitious goals to model entire cells from the atoms up. In the near term, researchers would like to simulate a cellular organelle and use these to inform laboratory experiments. They are also working to combine Frontier\u2019s high-resolution simulations of biological materials with ultra-fast imaging using X-ray free-electron lasers to accelerate discoveries.",
            "With Frontier, climate models have become more precise, too. In 2023, Oak Ridge climate scientist Matt Norman and other researchers used the supercomputer to run a global climate model with 3.25-kilometre resolution. Frontier\u2019s computing capability was necessary for them to create a decades-long forecast at this resolution1. The model also incorporated the effects of the complex motion of clouds, which occurs on an even finer resolution. \u201cIt took all of Frontier to do it,\u201d says Norman.",
            "Models would run significantly more slowly on other computers to achieve the same resolution while including the effects from clouds, he says. This limitation is a major hurdle for climate scientists seeking to forecast conditions, because cloud behaviour influences the movement of energy around the globe.",
            "\n\nSupercomputing poised for a massive speed boost\n",
            "For a model to be practical for weather and climate forecasts, it needs to run at least one simulated year per day. Frontier could run through 1.26 simulated years per day for this model1, a rate that will allow the researchers to create more-accurate 50-year forecasts than before.",
            "Frontier also brings higher resolution to cosmological scales. Astrophysicist Evan Schneider at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania is using the supercomputer to study how Milky Way-sized galaxies evolve as they age. Frontier\u2019s galaxy models span four orders of magnitude, up to large-scale galactic structures about 100,000 light years (30,660 parsecs) in size. Before Frontier, the largest structures she could model at comparable resolution were dwarf galaxies, which are about one-fiftieth the mass.",
            "Schneider simulates how supernovae cause gas to leak out of these galaxies2. Over time, thousands to millions of supernova explosions collectively release a significant amount of gas that ultimately exits the galaxy3. Because that gas is the raw material from which new stars are born, star formation slows down as the galaxies age. Frontier allows Schneider to include the effects of hotter gas than is practical with other computers. Her simulations suggest that current cosmological models downplay the role of this hot gas in the evolution of galaxies.",
            "AI researchers are also clamouring for time on Frontier\u2019s GPUs, known for their role in training neural-network-based architectures such as the transformer model underpinning ChatGPT. With its nearly 38,000 GPUs, Frontier occupies a unique public-sector role in the field of AI research, which is otherwise dominated by industry.",
            "Nur Ahmed, an economics researcher now at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, and his colleagues highlighted the gap between AI in academia and industry in a commentary last year4. In 2021, 96% of the largest AI models came from industry. On average, industry models were nearly 30 times the size of academic models. The discrepancy is evident in monetary investment, too. Non-defence US agencies provided US$1.5 billion to support AI research in 2021. In that same year, industry spent more than $340 billion globally.",
            "h2Mind the gap",
            "The gap has only widened since the release of commercial large language models, says Ahmed. The computational resources to train OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, for example, cost an estimated $78 million, whereas Google spent $191 million to train Gemini Ultra (see go.nature.com/44ihnhx). This gulf in investment leads to a stark asymmetry in the computing resources available to researchers in industry versus academia.",
            "Industry is pushing the boundaries of basic AI research, and this could pose a problem for the field, write Ahmed and his co-authors. Industry dominance could lead to a lack of basic research that is not immediately profitable and result, for example, in the development of AI technologies that neglect the needs of lower-income communities, say the researchers. In an unpublished study, Ahmed has analysed 6 million peer-reviewed articles and 32 million patent citations and found that \u201con average, industry tends to ignore some of the concerns of marginalized populations in the global south\u201d.",
            "\n\nClimate scientists push for access to world\u2019s biggest supercomputers to build better Earth models\n",
            "What\u2019s more, many models have problems with gender and racial bias, as found in several commercial face-recognition systems based on AI. Academics could serve as auditors to evaluate the risks from AI models, but to do so they need access to computational resources at the same scale as industry, says Ahmed.",
            "That\u2019s where Frontier comes in. Once Oak Ridge approves a project application, the researcher uses the supercomputer for free, as long as they publish their results. That will help university researchers to compete with companies, says computer scientist Abhinav Bhatele at the University of Maryland in College Park. \u201cThe only way people in academia can train similar-sized models is if they have access to resources like Frontier,\u201d he says.",
            "Bhatele is using Frontier to develop open-source LLMs as a counterbalance to industry models5. \u201cOften when companies train their models, they keep them proprietary, and they don\u2019t release the model weights,\u201d says Bhatele. \u201cWith this open research, we can make these models freely available for anyone to use.\u201d Over the next year, he and his team aim to train a range of LLMs of different sizes, and they will make these models, along with their weights, open-source. They have also made the software for training the models freely available. In this way, says Bhatele, Frontier has a crucial role in a movement in the field to \u201cdemocratize\u201d AI \u2014 to include more people in the technology\u2019s development.",
            "h2The race continues",
            "A few doors down from the room housing Frontier, its predecessor is still working hard performing jobs for scientists around the world. This machine, called Summit, held the world record for speed between 2018 and 2019 and is currently the world\u2019s ninth-fastest supercomputer among public machines. With its long black chrome racks, Summit resembles Frontier, but has a louder cooling system and works at one-eighth the speed.",
            "Summit\u2019s history hints at Frontier\u2019s future. Frontier first topped the list in 2022, and is likely to surrender that spot before long. The second-place supercomputer, Aurora, based at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, is expected to exceed Frontier\u2019s performance at some point with further optimization. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s El Capitan, scheduled to come online later this year at the California-based lab, is also projected to beat Frontier eventually. Also in the mix is Jupiter, an exascale supercomputer in Germany that is due to debut later this year.",
            "Mounting geopolitical tensions further complicate the rankings. Frontier\u2019s title comes from its position on a semiannual ranking from an organization called the TOP500. It rates the world\u2019s supercomputers on the basis of their reported performance on a benchmark task that involves solving a dense set of linear equations.",
            "But computing experts say it is likely that the United States and China are not sharing information publicly about their computing assets, especially because of increasing strain between the two countries. \u201cThere is this idea of a kind of a race in supercomputing,\u201d says Kevin Klyman, a policy researcher at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington DC. In fact, in 2022, the administration of US President Joe Biden implemented controls against exporting semiconductors to China, specifically citing concern about China\u2019s supercomputing capability.",
            "In the supercomputing arena, the tensions began years ago. Notably, in 2016, China overtook the United States in the number of supercomputers on the TOP500 list. \u201cThat caused a lot of anxiety in the United States,\u201d says Klyman. \u201cA lot of US policymakers said, \u2018How do we catch up in the list?\u2019\u201d",
            "Currently, the two countries have the most supercomputers on the TOP500 rankings released this June. The United States boasted 168 machines, whereas China had 80. Researchers wonder, however, whether these countries have powerful supercomputers that they have not disclosed in public. In fact, the number of Chinese machines on the current list has dropped since last November, when it included 104 machines. And China did not report results for any new supercomputers.",

It will be the latest in a decades-long quest for speed (see \u2018Speed records\u2019).

So researchers are continuing to push for improvements in energy efficiency. Frontier is more than four times as efficient as Summit, in large part because it is cooled by water at an ambient temperature, unlike Summit, which uses chilled water. About 3\u20134% of Frontier\u2019s total energy consumption goes to cooling, compared with 10% for Summit.",

They did this by synchronizing the energy transition with the tick of the world\u2019s most accurate clock. The work was led by Jun Ye at JILA, a research institute in Boulder, Colorado, and published in Nature on 5 September1. \u201cIt\u2019s really one of the most exciting papers in recent times,\u201d says Marianna Safronova, an atomic physicist at the University of Delaware in Newark.",

And because the clock\u2019s frequency is set by the fundamental forces that hold the nucleus together, the prototype could spot whether a type of dark matter \u2014 an invisible substance that accounts for around 85% of material in the Universe \u2014 affects these forces on a minuscule scale. \u201cThis is a new, direct window onto the nuclear force,\u201d says Fuchs.",

The most accurate atomic clock gains or loses only one second every 40 billion years. A nuclear clock would work slightly differently: the tick would correspond to the energy transitions of protons and neutrons, rather than electrons, as they reshuffle into an excited state.",
            "This energy shift requires a slightly higher, ultraviolet frequency, resulting in a faster tick rate that could match or surpass the accuracy of the atomic clock. But the nuclear clock\u2019s biggest potential advantage is the combination of precision and stability. Particles in the nucleus are less sensitive than electrons to disturbances such as electromagnetic fields \u2014 meaning that a nuclear clock could be portable and robust. \u201cIt becomes insensitive in a way that is kind of unthinkable in terms of how our clocks work today,\u201d says Anne Curtis, an experimental physicist at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, UK.",

In the 1970s, indirect evidence suggested that thorium-229 had a bizarrely low-energy nuclear transition2 \u2014 one that might eventually be triggered by tabletop lasers. But it wasn\u2019t until last year that scientists discovered the required frequency3 \u2014 and this year, they successfully initiated the shift with a laser4.",
            "The JILA team looked for the transition frequency in trillions of thorium-229 atoms embedded in a crystal using a system known as a frequency comb. The comb pumps out an array of laser frequency lines, with regular and even spacing. It allows researchers to illuminate the crystal with many precise frequencies simultaneously to look for a match, rather than scanning laboriously through the range of possible options using a single-frequency laser.",
            "The comb\u2019s settings \u2014 including the width of the gaps between the lines, or \u2018teeth\u2019 \u2014 were calibrated using the atomic clock and could be tweaked. The team conducted several experimental runs, and when they observed the tell-tale glow produced as thorium-229 atoms decay from their excited state, they used the settings to calculate the frequency driving the signal.",

This not only allowed the team to determine the absolute frequency value with high precision, but also opened up some cool possibilities in physics, says Zhang.",

The latest result \u2014 which pinpoints the frequency with an accuracy of 13 decimal places \u2014 is already precise enough to narrow down the possible energy ranges in which light dark matter could exist, says Fuchs. Nuclear physics could also benefit from the more precise transition frequency, which could help scientists to distinguish between possible shapes of the thorium-229 nucleus, she adds.",

Surgical repairs are meant to fix a torn tendon, often reattaching it to the head of the arm bone. But sutures, or stitches, are anchored at only a few points in the tissue. That puts a lot of force on each point. That pulling can often retear the already fragile tendon.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "It was built for King Djoser, the first ruler of Egypt\u2019s Third Dynasty. That was nearly 4,700 years ago. The structure\u2019s stone platforms get smaller as they rise from the ground. The six levels stand roughly 62 meters (200 feet) tall in the Saqqara necropolis. That\u2019s a vast ancient burial ground in northern Egypt.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Researchers now suggest that ancient people used a water-powered system to construct this pyramid. How? Builders would have controlled flows of water into and out of a large shaft inside the pyramid. The water\u2019s movement would have lifted and lowered a platform that carried building stones to higher levels.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists shared this idea August 5 in\u00a0PLOS ONE. The team was led by Xavier Landreau. He has a background in materials science and physics. He also founded a private research institute known as the Paleotechnic to study ancient technologies. It\u2019s in Paris, France.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "There\u2019s no broadly accepted explanation for how people built pyramids in ancient Egypt. It took millions of massive blocks. Some of those blocks weighed up to 2,500 kilograms (5,500 pounds).\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scholars have proposed several techniques \u2014 including ramps and cranes \u2014 to move such hefty stone blocks. Scientists have also thought about rope-and-pulley devices and\u202frolling wooden rods attached to stones.\u00a0",
            "Other studies have hinted that water played some role in building pyramids. ",
            "Earlier this year, researchers reported a newfound Nile tributary.\u202f(A tributary is a freshwater stream that feeds into a larger river.) This stream borders a chain of 31 pyramids, including Djoser\u2019s. It\u2019s dried up now. But boats carrying workers and building blocks could have traveled this branch of the Nile between 3,700 and 4,700 years ago. They might have docked near to sites where the pyramids now stand.\u00a0",
            "But water likely played an even bigger part in building Egypt\u2019s first pyramid, Landreau says. Designers of Djoser\u2019s pyramid devised techniques for controlling water flow, he now argues. This field of knowledge is known as hydraulics.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The proposed hydraulic system is based on a computer model. That model included data on features inside the pyramid and on a network of underground tunnels at the site. The team also added detailed satellite images of the region. These all helped to model ancient rainfall and runoff levels.\u00a0",
            "In addition to the pyramid itself, the model also included a walled enclosure several hundred meters (yards) away. Known as Gisr el-Mudir, this structure was first described in the 1700s. But its exact purpose has long been a puzzle.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In the new model, Gisr el-Mudir would have captured floodwater that flowed through desert channels during heavy rains. Structures in the walls of the enclosure fed the water to a basin just west of Djoser\u2019s burial grounds. Periods of intense rain may have temporarily turned that basin into a lake. Such a lake would have then drained into a section of a limestone trench around the burial complex. That trench is now known as the Dry Moat.\u00a0",
            "Water from the Dry Moat could have entered two large shafts. One was a north shaft inside the pyramid. Granite chambers near the bottom of both shafts contained stone plugs. When removed, water could rush in.\u00a0",
            "Landreau\u2019s group thinks the north shaft is the framework for a water-powered lift. They think a huge wooden float rested above its granite chamber. That float would have been attached to long ropes. These ropes could have passed over pulleys at the top of the shaft before looping around to attach to a lift platform. ",
            "Ancient engineers would have designed the float and lift platform to counterbalance each other as water filled or drained from the shaft.\u00a0",

            "fCThe controversial new study suggests that a stone-walled dam (far left) fed flood water to a deep trench (center). That water was then sent to a shaft inside the first ancient Egyptian pyramid (far right). The shaft may have served as an elevator to lift stones during the pyramid\u2019s construction.",
            "Workers hauling building stones could have gotten onto the lift platform at ground level. Or they might have gotten on through a tunnel several meters above ground level.\u00a0",
            "As water filled the shaft through the granite chamber, the float would rise and the platform descend. Water would be shut off when the platform reached the loading area. After placing tons of stones on the platform, the shaft would be drained. Then, as the float descended, it pulled on the ropes. And that yanked the platform and its cargo up to new construction levels.\u00a0",
            "Researchers not involved with the study find the water power idea intriguing. But they are not convinced that pyramid builders ever used it.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "One skeptic is Oren Siegel. He\u2019s an archaeologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. Gisr el-Mudir could not have held enough water from occasional rains to maintain this hydraulic system, he argues. Instead, Siegel thinks Gisr el-Mudir may have been an early experiment. It could have been used to test the building of stone enclosures like those that would later, on a larger scale, surround pharaohs\u2019 burial sites.\u00a0",
            "Kamil Kuraszkiewicz has doubts about something else: the proposed lake. It\u2019s not mentioned in any ancient Egyptian writings. He suspects it may never have existed. Kuraszkiewicz is an Egyptologist in Poland at the University of Warsaw.\u00a0",
            "Djoser\u2019s pyramid stones also each weighed, on average, some 300 kilograms (660 pounds). That may sound heavy. But these blocks were much smaller and easier for workers to move than the ones used for later pyramids, says Kuraszkiewicz. Building the proposed water-powered system, he says, would have required \u201cmuch more effort \u2026 than to move the stone blocks using just manpower.\u201d\u00a0"

            "A shooting star is normally a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it event. That space rock, or meteor, leaves a fiery trail of light as it zips through the atmosphere. Then it\u2019s gone. But sometimes, a lasting afterglow remains for minutes. For more than a century, astronomers have wondered why some meteors leave such \u201cpersistent trains.\u201d Now, they at last may have the answer.\u00a0",
            "To leave a lasting trail, meteors need to aim low. Space rocks that fall to about 90 kilometers (56 miles) above the ground before burning up boast lasting afterglows. But those that burn up higher in the atmosphere don\u2019t. These data come from a new survey of persistent meteor trains. Astronomers shared their new findings in the July issue of\u202fJournal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.\u00a0",
            "Amateur astronomers often record such trails \u201cas a nice movie,\u201d says Gunter Stober. This astrophysicist, who works at the University of Bern in Switzerland, did not take part in the new meteor survey. He concludes that it\u2019s \u201creally the first more comprehensive, total overview of [shooting star observations].\u201d\u00a0",
            "Persistent trains form when metals that have burned off an incoming space rock react chemically with a form of oxygen \u2014 ozone (O3) \u2014 in the air. These O3 reactions give off heat and light. These can keep a meteor train aglow for up to an hour.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Studies in the 1940s and 1950s suggested that such trains were rare. Only one in every 750 meteors was thought to produce one. And persistent trains were mostly associated with the brightest shooting stars.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "More recent studies have focused on the\u202fLeonid meteor storms in the early 2000s. Those were the most dramatic such showers in decades. Only the fastest meteors leave trains, these studies found. These were space rocks zinging through the air at speeds of around 70 kilometers (43 miles) per second.\u00a0",
            "But such surveys had their limits. Some were too broad, including one-off views of meteors from observers around the world. Others were too narrow; they might focus on just one spectacular meteor shower.\u00a0",

            "For the new survey, researchers set up a camera to stare at the same patch of sky above New Mexico for nearly two years. From October 2021 to July 2023, it recorded every light streak that crossed its field of view.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In that time, the camera saw nearly 7,500 meteors. About 850 of them \u2014 around one in every eight meteors \u2014 left persistent trains. One in 19 meteors left trains lasting more than five minutes.\u00a0",
            "That was surprising for two reasons. First, way more of the shooting stars left persistent trains than had been expected. Second, the meteors leaving those trains had all sorts of speeds and brightnesses.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Previously, many scientists had held that \u201cthese persistent trains were only formed by the fast, bright meteors,\u201d says Logan Cordonnier. He\u2019s an astrophysicist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \u201cWe found that it doesn\u2019t need to be fast,\u201d the new survey\u2019s leader says. In fact, he notes, \u201cMost of the persistent trains were formed by slower meteors.\u201d\u00a0",
            "The real factor that determined whether a shooting star left a lasting train was ozone, he says.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Meteors that zipped down to altitudes of 90 kilometers were far more likely to leave trains than those that burned up higher in the atmosphere. That key altitude of 90 kilometers is above the ozone layer in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. There is a little ozone at that height, Cordonnier says, just not nearly as much as below it.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In theory, meteors passing through the ozone layer, below, could also leave trails. But few make it that far down without burning up completely.\u00a0",
            "Future views of persistent trains could help probe the chemistry of Earth\u2019s atmosphere around 90 kilometers up. It\u2019s a mysterious layer of air. Cordonnier likens it to \u201cthe spot in your back where you can\u2019t itch.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Basically, \u201cit\u2019s too high in the atmosphere for weather balloons. And it\u2019s too low for satellites to take direct measurements,\u201d Cordonnier says. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult region to probe.\u201d Persistent trains, though, \u201chappen for free, all the time,\u201d he notes. \u201cWe just have to look.\u201d\u00a0",

It swirled for hours above Earth\u2019s northernmost magnetic site, or pole. Now, research has turned up parallel space hurricanes swirling high above the south magnetic pole.",
            "Scientists spotted the first space hurricane in 2021. It was a cyclone-shaped aurora \u2014 a type of northern light show. Unlike sea-level hurricanes, however, this one rained electrons, not water.",
            "Space physicist Sheng Lu at Shandong University in Weihai, China was part of a team that wanted to know if this type of special aurora was just a northern event. To find out, the group pored over satellite data on the southern hemisphere\u2019s ionosphere.",
            "Between 2005 and 2016 they turned up 259 space hurricanes. That\u2019s about 23 per year, on average. It\u2019s also close to the rate that had been estimated to develop in the northern ionosphere.",
            "The team identified other parallels, too. For instance, space hurricanes tend to emerge over the poles in each region\u2019s summer months.",
            "Lu\u2019s team shared its findings June 25 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics.",
            "A barrage of charged particles rains down on Earth from the sun. This solar wind can split our planet\u2019s magnetic-field lines\u00ad. Later, the lines will reconnect. As they do, they churn up ionized gas \u2014 or plasma \u2014 in the ionosphere. This can drive flows of electric current upward, Lu\u2019s team suggests. Those flows then bend and begin to spin. That creates a cyclonic \u201ceye\u201d at the center.",
            "So those shifts in Earth\u2019s magnetic field are what likely set off a space hurricane, the researchers now argue. This, they propose, would be similar to the rise of warm, humid air at the center of the tropical cyclones that spin across Earth\u2019s oceans."

But a new study suggests that eye reflections may offer one way to spot deepfakes. The approach relies on a technique used by astronomers to study galaxies.\u00a0",

If the light is spread evenly across pixels, the index is 0. This measure helps astronomers sort galaxies by shape, such as spiral or elliptical.\u00a0",

            "Archaeologists, take note. There may be brains hiding inside excavated human skulls. New data show that human brains can resist decay for at least 12,000 years.",
            "When scientists find ancient preserved brains, they often call their finds unique or one-of-a-kind, says Alexandra Morton-Hayward. A forensic anthropologist, she studies human remains to tell stories of the dead. She works at the University of Oxford in England. But as she came across report after report on preserved brains, Morton-Hayward started to wonder how rare such finds could be.",
            "So she and her colleagues scoured four centuries of archaeology research for mentions of naturally preserved brains. They found reference to more than 4,400 brains. They came from hundreds of dig sites.",
            "The researchers sorted these brains into five different types based on the processes that had kept them from rotting away. Some had been frozen or dried. Others had been tanned, thus preserving the organ through the same process used to treat leather. (This can happen when the remains react with chemicals found in bogs.) Still other brains had been saponified. ",

In each of these cases, all that remained of the body\u2019s once soft, squishy tissues was a preserved brain. The team reasoned that some unknown mechanism had saved its tissue from degrading. The researchers also collected past and present climate information to learn about the conditions linked to each type of brain preservation.",
            "Brains preserved by the unknown process tended to persist for far longer than the other types of brains. The oldest one was 12,000 years old. Most of these specimens came from wet environments \u2014 sunken shipwrecks, the bottom of wells, lake beds and so on.",
            "The research was published March 20 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
            "Based on studies of soft tissues from dinosaurs and other ancient creatures, the team came up with a hypothesis for how the unexplored mechanism protects brains. Morton-Hayward now suspects that features of the brain\u2019s chemistry and how it worked during life preserve it after death. The types of proteins and lipids in the brain may be especially prone to linking up in a way that makes big, stable molecules.",
            "With the mystery preservation process at play, long-lasting brains may be more common than researchers realized. \u201cI\u2019d just love if other archaeologists were as excited as I was to go out to my next dig and gently rattle every skull,\u201d Morton-Hayward says.",

The y-axis shows the number of brains found preserved up to each age. This number includes all brains that are the age marked on the x-axis or older. (For instance, look at the data point for \u201cunknown\u201d brains at an x-axis value of about 7,000. It has a y-axis value of about 100.

The shape of the curve (the line that moves through the points) shows how the number of brains found for each type drops off with increasing age. There weren\u2019t enough locations with saponified brains to draw trends about their changes with age.\u00a0"

            "The glow happens because fluorescent minerals contain excitable atoms known as activators. When UV light hits these atoms, their electrons gain energy.

The rest is emitted as visible light.\u00a0\u00a0",

That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Aalayah didn\u2019t take the possibility of a shooting seriously until she learned that a gunman shot and killed 26 first graders and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. \u201cI thought if it could happen to them \u2014 little innocent children \u2014 it could definitely happen to me at any time and place,\u201d she recalls.",

The group supports the idea of safety drills to deal with a wide range of hazards. But the drills need to be appropriate for children\u2019s different stages of development, says Josephine\u2019s mom, Michele Gay. And the drills should avoid scaring or possibly causing their own trauma.",
            "\u201cObviously, the point is to empower people,\u201d the former teacher says. \u201cBut the last thing we should be doing is frightening people.\u201d She says, \u201cWe\u2019re not focusing on some bad guy dressed up. We\u2019re not focusing on scary sounds or smells or anything sensorial. We\u2019re literally just talking about how we recognize when we\u2019re in a [threat] situation, and what are the actions.\u201d",
            "Safe and Sound Schools recommends that schools assess their own threat risks and shape plans to their communities. Plans should be tailored to the age and maturity of the kids involved. First graders might learn that different situations call for different responses. If there\u2019s a fire, you leave immediately. If there might be an intruder outside, you find a safe corner in a locked classroom and stay quiet. By high school, you might help with quickly locking and blocking doors.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWhen people are faced with an emergency situation, we know that they might not be able to think clearly,\u201d Gay explains. \u201cWe want all of that to be \u2018pre-loaded.\u2019 That\u2019s why we rehearse the steps of safety.\u201d",

            "Cheryl Lero Jonson is a criminologist at Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio. She and her colleagues recently studied how adults performed in two situations. One was a \u201ctraditional lockdown.\u201d People locked doors and stayed put. The other was a program taught by the ALICE Training Institute, based in Medina, Ohio. Depending on the situation, participants had to choose whether to get away, to block entry to a shelter spot and hide, or to fight to counter an attack.\u00a0",
            "For each of several cases, a shooter tried to enter a classroom and shoot plastic pellets at as many people as possible. When people could only hide, the classroom attacks lasted from 22 seconds to almost five minutes. On average, almost three in every four people got shot in those cases. When people had choices, the average time for the classroom attacks was 16 seconds, and an average of just one in every four inside got shot. Jonson\u2019s team concluded that shootings would end sooner and have fewer injuries if drills offered choices. The study appeared in the December 2018 Journal of School Violence.\u00a0",
            "Another recent study skipped the guns and used a computer model. Researchers at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., based their model on the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado. In that attack, two teens killed 13 people and then themselves. The computer model tested cases in which everyone hid, everyone ran or everyone fought. It also tested a case in which one third ran, another third hid and the rest fought the attackers.\u00a0",
            "The model\u2019s results showed that everyone would have been shot if they all hid. There would have been 21 victims if everyone ran. And it calculated that there would have been five victims if everyone fought. The best result was the combo scenario, with three victims.\u00a0",
            "Eric Dietz worked on the model at Purdue. The choices to run, hide or fight aren\u2019t equally good, this computer scientist stresses. \u201cIt isn\u2019t run or hide or fight. It\u2019s run if you can. Hide only to get back to running again when you can. And if you can\u2019t run or hide any more, then you\u2019d better fight, because you\u2019ve got no other options left.\u201d He and others hope to minimize casualties if a shooting does take place. But, he adds, \u201cWe want to make sure we have some science to back up why we tell students to take certain actions.\u201d",

            "Kenneth Trump heads National School Safety and Security Services. It\u2019s a company in Cleveland, Ohio. He sees a big risk for bias in the study by Jonson\u2019s group. Why? One of its authors works for the ALICE Institute, which makes money doing shooter drills and training. Jonson and the other co-author were certified trainers for the ALICE program. Plus, the study participants were already going through training at the ALICE Institute, and only a few were educators. (Jonson did say that her team took some steps to reduce bias. The \u201cshooter\u201d was not with the ALICE program, and instructions were very specific, for example. Yet the group studied was not a random sample.)",
            "More generally, Trump says, options-based training for students \u201cfails to consider age and developmental factors.\u201d It also fails to consider other variables, such as children who might have special needs (such as being deaf or needing a wheelchair). Students may give shooters more targets if they run. And a majority of school shooters have not been subdued by citizens. Some school employees also have been injured in options-based shooter drills, he adds. In contrast, lockdowns focus on securing classrooms and avoiding more risky situations. In his view, \u201clockdowns work and are the gold standard in best practices for more than two decades.\u201d",
            "And even the scenarios with fewer victims still had some casualties. Aalayah says she hadn\u2019t minded doing shooter drills because she likes to be prepared. \u201cBut afterward, I realized how stupid they are,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t save you in a real situation.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Julia Susany, now 19, had done different types of shooter drills since first grade. She feels it helped to be prepared. Still, young students didn\u2019t really understand why they did the drills. After the Sandy Hook shooting, that changed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t reassuring once I realized what we were doing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt became more creepy.\u201d And it felt like schools were treating shootings as something almost normal. Nonetheless, she says, \u201cI was glad I had at least something to fall back on in case there was an emergency.\u201d",
            "Julia\u2019s high school in Akron, Ohio, taught drills with options to get away, hide or fight. However, the teachers stopped short of having students actually throw things at a role-playing gunman. After all, someone could get hurt.\u00a0",
            "Several students did get bumps and bruises during a December 2019 drill in New Richmond, Ohio. The principal had acted as a shooter. The students were trying to get away. The school used the same type of program as Julia\u2019s high school.\u00a0",
            "Some experts also worry that drills could cause emotional harm. In a 2007 study, Nickerson and a colleague looked at the short-term effects of an intruder drill. Two groups of 4th-, 5th- and 6th-grade students learned about the steps. Then they practiced the drill. Teachers locked classroom doors and shut off the lights. Students moved into corners. Everyone tried to stay quiet.\u00a0",
            "Afterward, the team gave a five-question quiz to those students and two other groups that didn\u2019t do the drills. The groups that practiced had more knowledge about what to do for a drill. And their anxiety levels were not much different from those in kids from the other groups. The team concluded that similar drills could increase children\u2019s short-term knowledge and give them useful skills to use in a real crisis.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe didn\u2019t do long-term follow-up in our study,\u201d Nickerson notes. \u201cAnd I know of no research that has.\u201d Her study also didn\u2019t look at more intense drills, such as run-hide-fight programs. It\u2019s highly unlikely that students would ever come face-to-face with an active threat. Plus, a drill that could cause mental trauma would \u201craise ethical concerns,\u201d the study noted.",
            "\u201cGetting behind a locked door saves lives,\u201d says school psychologist Melissa Reeves. She studies school-crisis prevention at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C. Typical lockdown drills can be done calmly without raising anxiety levels in most students, she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t promise that nothing bad is ever going to happen.

Students have cowered as alarms blared and masked \u201cgunmen\u201d shot blanks or starter guns. Some schools have had students play shooting victims. Teens at one charter high school in Colorado even practiced how to take down a mock gunman.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe don\u2019t light a fire in the hallway to practice fire drills,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cAnd we do not have to shoot off a safety gun or have screaming to simulate what it\u2019s like to be in an active-shooter situation.\u201d And while a drill might not be stressful for most students, it could stress some. \u201cIf your school is asking you to participate in a highly sensorial drill,\u201d she says, \u201cyou have a right to say no if you are uncomfortable.\u201d",
            "Schools also should give students and parents some warning about when drills will happen. \u201cThere should never, ever be an unannounced, highly sensorial drill,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cThere should never be an unannounced lockdown drill.\u201d Indeed, unannounced drills have caused some kids to run from schools. Panicky 911 calls followed.",
            "If done well, a lockdown drill can lower anxiety and teach students good, adaptive behaviors for when a bad situation arises, Brock says. And the options of evacuating or hiding also can serve other, less scary purposes. For instance, such procedures might deal with something like a strange dog on the premises.",
            "However, Brock recommends against having armed-assailant or active-shooter drills for elementary-school students. And he\u2019s wary about using them with students in middle school and high school. If a student has a history of trauma or is already anxious, depressed or stressed, \u201cthese drills are going to be upsetting.\u201d Some students might have had friends or family members who were victims of gun violence.\u00a0",

            "When Chardon High School resumed drills after the 2012 shooting, there were no real gunshots, Siegel-Green says. Parents could choose to keep students home. Counselors were on hand to talk with students. Comfort dogs were also available for at least one drill after the shooting. However, not all schools offer that type of follow-up. Julia says students at her school generally knew they could see a counselor if they felt stressed. Still, it wasn\u2019t emphasized.\u00a0",
            "\u201cIn most cases, people participate in these drills and don\u2019t get more anxious and fearful. But that could certainly happen.

            "Stricter laws on gun storage also can keep firearms out of many shooters\u2019 hands, the groups say. And often a shooter may target classmates at a school he or she attended. So, the report argues, \u201csafety drills with students may be ineffective\u201d because they would share preparedness steps with the people most likely to carry out a shooting.",

            "The runner on the treadmill at the University of Washington wasn\u2019t your typical gym rat. For one thing, he kept sprinting to the front of the treadmill and riding it to the back. For another, he had six legs.",
            "The Seattle athlete was a fruit fly \u2014 officially known as Drosophila melanogaster. And for the first time, high-speed cameras watched him and other flies work out on the tiny treadmill. The videos have just revealed insights into how fly bodies move.",
            "It creates a great opportunity to study how the fly brain controls different aspects of walking, says Eugenia Chiappe. \u00a0This neuroscientist works at the Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal. She did not take part in the new work. But it\u2019s important, she adds, to understand how brains of these \u2014 and other animals \u2014 pull this off.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Fruit flies and humans look very different. Yet their brains are similar in many ways. So studying the flies could help researchers work out the basic biology of movement. \u201cOur interaction with the environment, other animals and fellow human beings [is] crucial for our survival,\u201d Chiappe says. And those interactions depend \u201cdepend on the ability of the brain to monitor and control movement.\u201d",
            "Researchers fashioned their mini treadmill out of simple and easy-to-get belts, pulleys and motors. Its overall length spans just over four times the body length of a fruit fly \u2014 about 2 millimeters (0.08 inch). To prevent the critters from flying away, researchers trimmed the flies\u2019 wings. A glass chamber coated with slippery Rain-X surrounded the treadmill. It limited the flies\u2019 ability to wall-walk. When the treadmill was on, the only floor available was a moving one.",
            "On the treadmill, the flies moved as they normally do. Most of the time, they quickly ran to the front of the treadmill. Then they stopped and rode its traveling belt back to the end. As their abdomens then nicked the back of the chamber, the startled flies sprinted forward again.",
            "\u201cThey sprint and then stop, sprint and then stop,\u201d says Brandon Pratt, a neural engineer on the Seattle team.",
            "The flies easily hit speeds of 50 millimeters (just under two inches) per second. That\u2019s the \u201cfastest speed ever reported\u201d for Drosophila moving on the ground, Pratt says. He\u2019s confident the flies can go even faster (though the researchers didn\u2019t thoroughly test this).",
            "Some of these flies proved to be marathon-level athletes, easily handling treadmill sessions pushing 90 minutes. Pratt\u2019s team posted its results to bioRxiv.org on February 24.",
            "As the flies ran faster, their bodies moved higher. They rose up on their tiptoes, or \u201ctippy-tarsi,\u201d as Pratt says. He\u2019s referring to flies\u2019 leg parts that move somewhat like human feet.",
            "The flies treadmills could be modified to have two different belts. These treadmills could force each side of the insect\u2019s body to move at a different speed. The flies\u2019 middle legs compensated for this odd arrangement, the tests showed. The flies adjust their step distances to keep moving straight ahead. This change in stepping is akin to how a fly might handle a sudden gust of wind from one side. They would turn into the wind by changing the stride on the opposite side.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Zgq9JkUrPLg?feature=oembed",
            "Fruit flies walk normally on a treadmill that moves at a steady pace on both sides (left). Flies can also adjust to a treadmill that has two different speeds (right). Careful analyses of stepping patterns revealed that flies\u2019 middle legs helped keep the fly moving forward.",
            "One thing the flies wouldn\u2019t do: Run backwards. \u201cThey like to run upriver,\u201d Pratt says.",
            "The treadmill doesn\u2019t allow scientists to record what\u2019s going on in the flies\u2019 brains as they move. That would be a valuable bit of data, Chiappe says. It could show how brain cells spring into action as the flies walk, run or adjust their stride.",
            "Other test systems allow more detailed glimpses into the brain of a moving fly. This includes spheres on which tethered flies can walk. But those systems don\u2019t allow the fly to move as naturally as the Seattle team\u2019s treadmill does.",
            "In addition to producing insights on movement, the treadmill experiments sparked some friendly competition, Pratt says. \u201cThere was a point where we were like, \u2018Can we find the most athletic fly?\u2019 We started going down a rabbit hole,\u201d he says. \u201cWe even did a side project where we did endurance training in flies. It got a little ridiculous.\u201d"

            "The beluga whale wears its heart on its sleeve \u2014 or rather, its forehead.",
            "Every beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) has a big bulge on its forehead called its \u201cmelon.\u201d This fat-filled bump helps aim the sound waves a beluga makes for echolocation. But this squishy organ might also be used for communication. Now, researchers have cataloged the expressions that belugas in captivity seem to make with this wobbly forehead fat.",
            "Belugas mold their melon using muscles and connective tissue. They can extend the melon forward until it juts over their lips. This shape looks sort of like the bill of a baseball cap. Belugas can also mush their melon down until it\u2019s flat against their skull. Or lift it upward to create a fleshy top hat. They can even shake it with enough force that it jiggles like Jell-O.",
            "\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t scream \u2018pay attention to me,\u2019 I don\u2019t know what does,\u201d says Justin Richard. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a peacock spread their feathers.\u201d Richard studies animal behavior at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston. His team shared its new findings March 2 in Animal Cognition.",
            "Before Richard became a scientist, he spent a decade as a beluga trainer. He worked closely with the animals at Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut. \u201cEven as a trainer, I knew the shapes meant something,\u201d Richard says. \u201cBut nobody had been able to put together enough observations to make sense of it.\u201d",
            "From 2014 to 2015, he was part of a group that recorded interactions between four belugas at Mystic Aquarium. This footage revealed that the belugas make five distinct melon shapes. The scientists dubbed these flat, lift, press, push and shake. When interacting socially, the whales sported an average of\u00a0nearly two shapes per minute.",

            "It\u2019s not clear whether belugas make these shapes on purpose. It\u2019s possible the animals make them unconsciously when having different emotions. But belugas made 93 percent of the shapes when another beluga could see them. So Richard suspects they\u2019re likely purposeful signals.",
            "Shake and press are proving harder to interpret. \u201cThere are probably some [fine details of the shapes] that are meaningful to them [but] that are difficult for us to pick out,\u201d Richard says. \u00a0\u00a0",
            "The team confirmed its findings from the first four belugas in a larger group of captive whales. Fifty-one belugas at MarineLand Canada in Niagara Falls showed the same melon shapes as the Mystic whales.",
            "The five shapes described in this study may just be the tip of the iceberg, Richard says. Scientists have yet to track how these whales use their melon in the wild. It would be especially interesting to see how they move it during key behaviors, such as group foraging. Or when mother belugas interact with their calves.",
            "The findings establish a shared vocabulary for the melon expressions, says Malin Lilley. She works at Texas A&M University\u2013Central Texas in Killeen. Other researchers, she says, can now build on this as they work to decode beluga communication. Lilley herself studies marine-mammal behavior and cognition but did not take part in the new study.",

            "Labeling melon shapes is key to understanding belugas, Lilley says. But it\u2019s also just plain cool to have words for the squishy expressions she\u2019s seen in her years studying these whales.",
            "Richard and Lilley are both eager to learn how melon shapes interact with belugas\u2019 voices. These whales let out a near-constant stream of whistles, chirps, squeals and clicks. That chatter has earned belugas the nickname \u201ccanaries of the sea.\u201d\u00a0",
            "If wild belugas make these kinds of expressions in murky Arctic waters, then \u201cthere must be important information that\u2019s being transmitted,\u201d Richard says. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a reason they spend so much time doing it.\u201d"

            "By accident, researchers stumbled on a new way to give jeans their iconic blue hue. The light-driven process could help dye denim with fewer harsh chemicals.\u00a0",
            "Denim is usually dyed with indigo. But this compound doesn\u2019t easily dissolve in water. So harsh chemicals are used to break it down into a liquid that can turn the fabric blue.\u00a0Each year, tens of thousands of tons of these harsh chemicals go into making denim across the world. Many are then dumped as waste into streams.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very toxic to both the environment [and] also the workers,\u201d says Katrine Qvortrup. She\u2019s a chemist at Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.",
            "Denim-dyeing chemicals can harm fish. They also pose health risks to workers who must use them. Formaldehyde is just one of the potentially cancer-causing chemicals that denim-makers use. So Qvortrup and her colleagues wanted to find a safer way to make jeans blue.\u00a0",
            "For their new dyeing technique, the researchers chose to use indican. It\u2019s the substance in indigo plants from which natural indigo dye is made. And unlike indigo, indican does dissolve in water. That means using it directly requires fewer harsh chemicals.",
            "In the past, others have used bacteria to make indican. But this only worked for producing small batches. To make enough for the big denim industry, the Danish team needed a new way. Their solution: Tweak an indican-producing enzyme found in indigo plants. This enzyme can make enough indican for factory-scale production, the researchers say.",
            "Their first idea was to mix indican with a second enzyme that would convert it to indigo. Then they dipped yarn in this liquid solution. It worked \u2014 the yarn turned blue within a few minutes.",
            "This sped-up video shows denim developing color over 40 minutes after being soaked in an enzyme solution.",
            "But the team also dipped some yarn in indican alone, without the second enzyme. A few of these samples got left on a windowsill in their lab. And to their surprise, these \u201cwere just turning blue without us doing anything,\u201d says Ditte Hededam Welner. \u201cWe were like, \u2018What\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d Welner is a biochemist on the team.",
            "It turns out that sunlight reacted with the indican on the yarn, converting it to indigo.",
            "How? The light turned a substance in the indican into a radical. A radical is a molecule with unpaired outer electrons, which primes it to bond to other molecules. Once turned into radicals, indoxyl molecules can bond with each other to form indigo.",
            "The team dipped more yarn in an indican solution, again with no enzyme. Then, they exposed the mix to various light sources. \u201cVery slowly, over the next couple of hours, [the yarn] will turn blue, and more and more blue,\u201d Welner says. \u201cThe light will develop the color.\u201d",
            "Light from the sun, from LEDs and even from household light bulbs can do this.\u00a0In fact, light can dye denim even darker than the enzyme method could using the same amount of indican.",
            "The researchers shared their discovery February 27 in Nature Communications.",
            "Using indican as a dye \u2014 with either an enzyme or light \u2014 would reduce the environmental harm from denim dyeing, the researchers say.",
            "They calculated the impact of each method using factors such as the materials involved, wastes produced and more. They looked at things such as carbon dioxide emissions and worker exposures to toxic chemicals.",
            "The enzyme-based method seems most promising. It could cut the harmful impacts by more than 90 percent, compared to normal denim dyeing, the scientists estimate.",
            "Light-driven dyeing is also less harmful than current methods, though not by quite as much. It might cut the impacts of dyeing denim by more than 70 percent. But the light method might take up less space than the enzyme method \u2014 and use less land. And if the researchers can cut electricity costs by dyeing with just sunlight, not bulbs, the light method may prove even better for the environment.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Using indican instead of indigo may be much better for the environment in some ways, says Robert Vos. He\u2019s a sustainability scientist who did not take part in the new project. Vos works at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But, he notes, the new dyeing methods still use lots of water. And this is a concern because a lot of water also goes into growing the cotton used to make denim.",
            "Both of the new indican-dyeing methods will require more testing before either can be used in factories. But at least cost shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Even with the cost of materials, such as LED lights, the light method may not raise the cost of denim dyeing at all, Qvortrup estimates. The enzyme method should cost only a few cents more per pair of jeans.",
            "That\u2019s a good thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to develop sustainable jeans [just] for the rich people,\u201d Qvortrup says. \u201cOur aim is to help to make it a cleaner process and not as polluting.\u201d",
            "Welner hopes these methods will have an impact even before they reach factories. Simply learning about more sustainable ways to make jeans may make denim-wearers think about where their clothes come from, she says. \u201cIf you want to wear blue denim,\u201d she says, \u201cbe aware that there are better ways to make it\u201d than are used right now."

            "A never-before-seen type of eruption explosively blasted debris high into the sky from Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano in 2018. It wasn\u2019t one big ka-pow! Kilauea had been erupting lava. Then a series of 12 strange blasts occurred over a span of 11 days. These blasts sent gas, ash and rock eight kilometers (five miles) into the air.",
            "Scientists now liken those blasts to the action of a stomp rocket. That\u2019s a toy propelled from a launch pad as somebody stomps on a pocket of air, suddenly compressing it.",
            "It\u2019s unlike the two well-known processes that trigger most volcanic explosions, notes Joshua Crozier. He\u2019s a geophysicist at Stanford University in California. He also was lead author of the new study.",
            "One standard process is a sudden release of pressure as hot magma moves up pipe-like channels from underground. The magma contains bubbles of gas. As they expand, molten rock will blast out the top of the crater. Most other explosions arise when a rising plume of magma flash-heats groundwater pooled in some of the volcano\u2019s rocks. This will shoot steam and broken bits of rock skyward.",
            "But neither such process seems to explain what happened at Kilauea six years ago.",
            "Instruments near the volcano\u2019s summit collected data as it blew its top again and again between May 16 and May 27, 2018. Those data now suggest the strange sequence of explosions were due to something scientists had never noticed before.",
            "For one thing, the erupted material didn\u2019t contain bubbly bits of magma. That\u2019s what you\u2019d expect from the first process, Crozier says. And rocks in the caldera were already far too hot to contain much liquid water. That eliminates the second scenario.",
            "Instead, it seems large chunks of the crater\u2019s rock fell down into the chamber of magma below. Each drop suddenly compressed air in the magma chamber. This must have sent volcanic debris shooting skyward, Crozier\u2019s team now argues.",
            "They liken this to the way stepping hard on the air bladder of a stomp rocket sends its foam projectile flying.",
            "Crozier\u2019s team described this novel volcanic action May 27 in Nature Geoscience.",
            "A falling of the \u201croof rock\u201d at the volcano\u2019s summit appears to have smooshed magma in the chamber below. Such a collapse of the crater\u2019s rock is known as subsidence. And this collapse didn\u2019t happen all at once. There were a series of successive drops. Each likely triggered another explosive burst.",
            "Almost as soon as the eruptions began, Crozier and others began suspecting these bursts traced to those collapses in the volcano\u2019s caldera. To confirm their hunch, the team pored over abundant data that has been continuously collected at the site.",
            "Kilauea is one of the most extensively instrumented volcanoes in the world. Networks of seismometers keep close watch on Kilauea\u2019s inner workings. Meanwhile, GPS-armed tiltmeters near its summit record subtle changes in the movement and slope of the ground. This tracks how magma moving below strains the rock.",

This was several weeks after the stomp rocket\u2013style eruptions had ended. Red circles mark the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, or HVO, and the Volcano House hotel.",
            "The Hawaiian Volcano Observatory also has a network of microphones that pick up frequencies below what the human ear can hear. These infrasound rumblings pointed to changes in air pressure. Some were likely caused by explosions.",
            "Changes in the frequency of infrasound waves moving through the ground revealed a distinct pattern during May 2018. They suggest the chamber would enlarge, after which there would be an explosion. Seismic waves, meanwhile, showed a series of distinct earthquakes. Each was less than a magnitude 5 in intensity. These, too, were linked to the explosions.",
            "What likely happened, the researchers say, is that the magma chamber drained enough to make its rocky roof unstable. This let that ceiling rock fall under its own weight. The falling rock suddenly compressed air above the magma \u2014 like compressing a stomp rocket\u2019s air bladder. Some 10 to 30 seconds later, cameras observed the summit shooting hot gas and rock up and out of the magma chamber.",
            "\u201cThis is the first time, to my knowledge, that such a mechanism has been suggested to drive eruptions,\u201d says Larry Mastin. He works at the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Wash.",
            "Mastin did not take part in the new analyses. But as a volcanologist, he understands what can go on in and around magma chambers. What\u2019s being reported is \u201ca rather unusual mechanism,\u201d he notes. \u201cBut the circumstances of this eruption are unusual.\u201d And unusually good monitoring proved \u201cvery useful in helping narrow down the cause.\u201d",
            "The stomp-rocket mechanism only affected the very early stages of Kilauea\u2019s summit collapse, Mastin says. That was basically when \u201cthe roof [was] falling in right above the magma.\u201d Over time, as the collapse in the caldera floor\u2019s radiated outward, the tightly focused stomp-rocket compression ended. And that largely stopped the eruptions as debris clogged the vent in the central caldera.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Stomp-rocket-style eruptions probably aren\u2019t unique to Kilauea, Crozier says. The volcano\u2019s extensive monitoring just made it especially easy to detect the new phenomenon, he says. Knowing how to link seismic and infrasound data may one day help mitigate hazards elsewhere, he says \u2014 at volcanoes with far less instrumentation.",
            "\u201cIn many cases, the first sign we have of an eruption is a seismic or infrasound signal,\u201d Crozier says. The better that science gets at relating such data to what the erupting plume is doing, he says, \u201cthe better we can calibrate our models.\u201d And that, he says, could help warn of upcoming explosive risks."

She\u2019s a graduate student and physical chemist on the Columbia team. The conventional ways to find microplastics just weren\u2019t able to detect these smaller bits, she says.",
            "The new tool identified tiny bits of PET plastic. It\u2019s the same plastic used to make the bottles. The tool also found polystyrene, PVC and polymethyl methacrylate. The team suspects that filters at the bottling plant were the sources of these. But most of the nano bits found were not one of the seven plastics their tool could identify. The researchers don\u2019t know what they are or where they came from.",
            "Yan\u2019s team shared its results online January 16 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/a_8QRSFMMlk?feature=oembed",
            "Researchers at Oregon State University estimate that there\u2019s as much nanoplastic pollution in the environment as all larger plastics \u2014 from leftover trash to microplastic bits in the air and water. They\u2019re also working on ways to measure nanoplastics. The end of the video suggests ways to avoid generating more nanoplastics.",
            "Not all scientists are convinced by the new numbers. Among them is Du\u0161an Materi\u0107. He\u2019s an analytical scientist. He heads a research group that studies micro- and nanoplastics at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research. It\u2019s in Leipzig, Germany.",
            "Materi\u0107 is working to create standard methods to test for nanoplastics. They don\u2019t exist yet, he says. Such new methods will have to be scientifically sound. Without that, there\u2019s no way to truly know how many particles are there. What\u2019s more, he adds, it\u2019s easy to contaminate samples. When this happens there\u2019s no telling where the polluting bits might have come from. Were they already in the water? Did they come from a researcher\u2019s lab?",
            "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence. Using it to identify the plastic bits, as the Columbia team did, can be another source of error, Materi\u0107 says. The new algorithm may be prone to \u201cfalse positives,\u201d he says \u2014 where other things are mistaken for plastic. This would exaggerate how many plastic bits were present.",
            "More standardization is needed here, agrees Kurunthachalam Kannan. He\u2019s an environmental chemist who has studied microplastics. He works at New York State\u2019s Department of Health in Albany. Without a standardized way to test for micro- or nanoplastics, results from different labs can\u2019t be compared in terms of their number or size, he points out.",
            "But whether the water holds 10 pieces of nanoplastics or 100,000, one thing is certain \u2014 they\u2019re there. And one big question remains: What are their health impacts?",
            "These nano-scale bits are very, very small, notes Phoebe Stapleton. She\u2019s a toxicologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J. She also is part of the team that measured them in water. Bits this size can be breathed in. From the lungs they could pass into the blood. Or, if consumed, they could pass into the blood from the gut, says Stapleton.",
            "Once in the blood, the tiny bits can move throughout the body, reaching cells anywhere.",
            "Rain can wash nanoplastics from the air and onto plants, including farm crops. Scientists found some plants absorb these tiny plastics. In fact, eating leafy plants is yet another pathway for these tiny plastics to enter the body. It\u2019s something two researchers at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing described. They mentioned this in a January 3 commentary in Environmental Science & Technology Letters.",
            "But are these nano bits harmful? Past studies placed nanoplastic bits directly onto cells to study their impacts. That caused some toxicity and cancer-causing changes, Stapleton notes. But scientists don\u2019t yet know what happens when the exposure is to the whole body.",
            "\u201cWe know they get in,\u201d says Stapleton. \u201cSo really, the question is about that toxicity\u201d \u2014 what harm they might cause to us. She plans to investigate that.",

            "\u201cDehydration probably causes more [health risks] than exposure to nanoplastics,\u201d adds Yan. So don\u2019t hesitate to drink bottled water if that\u2019s all you have. However, past studies have shown tap water contains fewer plastic bits than bottled water.",
            "\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re exposed to so many plastic particles from different sources is the reality we have right now,\u201d notes Qian. But we can limit this pollution by reducing, reusing and recycling plastics. We can also look for using alternatives to plastics."

            "My parents didn\u2019t realize that I\u2019d probably have good opportunities after graduation. They fought with me to change my degree. I went through the entire process of switching from veterinary medicine to biochemistry. All that was left was for me to submit the form.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "My experience with Skipper, though, got me thinking about what I wanted to do. I grew up fascinated with how an animal could be trained. I wanted to see how that could influence the lives of humans. I never submitted the form to switch programs.\u00a0\u00a0",

I read as many books as I could and watched YouTube videos. I would also take in dogs from clients and train them. By the time I learned about how animals can help a person\u2019s well-being, I felt like this was something I could do as a vet and dog trainer. So I just jumped straight into [using] it to help neurodivergent children.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Our first challenge was reaching children who could benefit from animal-assisted therapy. We considered working with children in their homes. But the stigma surrounding autism made it a daunting experience. Instead, we tried connecting with centers that work with these children. It took a while before any of them would listen to us, but one loved the idea. They offered to have us come talk to parents and stakeholders at an event. Another center gave us the chance to run a trial to see if it would work. We ended up getting tremendous results. That let us get our message out there.

            "That idea involving witchcraft doesn\u2019t hold any longer. But we still see the effects of it in our society.

The family might try to hide the child from the community and not associate with the child publicly.\u00a0\u00a0",

The main treatment in Nigeria and much of Africa right now is through accessible schools. The children receive therapeutic services and an education.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "LOS ANGELES, Calif. \u2014 When Amelia Hammersley was in sixth grade, her younger sister went to the hospital after hurting her head in a fall. Her diagnosis: a concussion. That\u2019s a temporary type of traumatic brain injury, or TBI.",

As a result, he or she steps in time but takes steps that are 20 percent shorter because of the mud. What happens then? Answer: Those who have crossed the 50-yard line are traveling at 80 percent the speed of those who have not, and the line of band members bends at the 50-yard line, just like light in this experiment.

These people showed a strong immune reaction in their noses within one day of exposure. It brought in high levels of interferons \u2014 about the same levels as it took the sick group to mount in five days. In the people who would become sick, it now appears that those extra days gave the virus time to multiply and spread.",

Lightning would hit a tree and it would fall. Rarely would it burn beyond an acre.\u201d Now, he said, larger fires are prevalent.",

Grasses such as red brome and Mediterranean split grass are highly flammable, and in wet years they grow in profusion and create more intense and far more widespread fires.",
            "There is also concern that the invasion of exotic species, in combination with climate change and the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen \u2014 which wafts in from the smoggy Los Angeles basin and stimulates the growth of flammable grasses \u2014 will keep the post-fire Joshua woodlands from reestablishing themselves. Instead, those areas could convert to a non-native grassland with low biodiversity.",

The federal government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, rejected federal endangered species protection for both subspecies, most recently in 2023.",
            "One reason for the lack of protection is that there is currently no shortage of Joshua trees \u2014 the threat is based on projections of future loss. The population of eastern Joshua trees is estimated to be several million, and the western population contains as many as 10 million trees. Nonetheless, Cummings argues that they are both deserving of protection because the forecasts of the future look bleak. \u201cWe know they are on an extinction trajectory, given the threat of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf climate change is frozen at current levels, we [still] lose half their range.\u201d Temperatures, of course, are not expected to remain steady.",

In Joshua Tree National Park, managers are clearing grasses in refugia, for example, to remove fuel and create fire breaks between trees.",

You\u2019ve got to move the yucca moth pollinator. You\u2019ve got to monitor. All of the research we\u2019ve seen so far suggests it\u2019s not a viable option at this moment in time.

If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",

They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions.

            "Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls.\n",
            "Back in 1978, glaciologist John Mercer, of Ohio State University, warned of a \u201cmajor disaster \u2013 a rapid five-meter rise in sea level, caused by deglaciation of West Antarctica\u201d \u2014 should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise. Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "Ice-sheet modeling last year by Kaitlin Naughten of the British Antarctic Survey concurred. \u201cThe opportunity to preserve the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in its present-day state has probably passed,\u201d she concluded, \u201cand policymakers should be prepared for several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.\u201d",
            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",
            "BQSome experts are confident that giant undersea curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean.",
            "Moore wants to get started on testing the idea, and he and his collaborators are seeking research funding.

            "Real-world experiments could follow quickly, says Moore. \u201cWithin two years, we could be working at a fjord in northern Norway, testing different designs in a marine setting.\u201d He has identified a target fjord but won\u2019t say where. \u201cIf that goes well, we would want to scale up to a curtain as much as a kilometer across.\u201d He envisions this being tested among the glaciers of Svalbard, the Norwegian Arctic archipelago that has become an international center for polar research. \u201cIn 10-15 years, we should have something to deploy in Antarctica,\u201d he says.",
            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany.

            "Hugh Hunt, an engineering professor and deputy director of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Climate Repair, has another proposal. \u201cWe have been looking for ideas that involve less infrastructure,\u201d he says. The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",
            "Moore calls the bubble barrier a \u201cwild card.\u201d But, he says, \u201cit is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.\u201d Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched.",
            "BQAn Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides.",
            "There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "In an ideal world, Scambos says, \u201cwe could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.\u201d But the world isn\u2019t like that. Climate negotiators at the UN COP28 meeting last December \u201cbrought up the notion that decarbonizing could go slower now that these [geoengineering] ideas are out there,\u201d Scambos says. \u201cThe idea that \u2018scientists are working on the problem\u2019 could be a death knell for the 22nd century.\u201d",
            "Moore has heard these criticisms. \u201cYes, there is opposition,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to address that. We need a social licence.\u201d He agrees that there are other important causes of current and future sea-level rise. But \u201cnone of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.\u201d",
            "If the glaciers are past their tipping points, dooming the world\u2019s coastal lands, he says, we may have no alternative but to bite the geoengineering bullet. And the sooner we get started, he says, the better."

I saw few signs of human life on the wild Nahanni and the muddy Liard. But once I got to the Mackenzie, which is part of the second longest river system on the continent, I had to make way for tugboats pulling giant barges filled with gas, heating fuel, dry food, and other supplies destined for roadless Indigenous communities downstream of the village of Wrigley, where the Mackenzie Highway, which begins in Alberta, ends. More than once on a cold misty night, I was awoken in my tent by the deafening blast of a tug\u2019s horn.",

In fact, the government-owned company that operates the tugs stopped service altogether this year when it became clear the river would not contain sufficient water \u2014 even in late spring, after river ice melted.

The road was estimated to cost at least $700 million, and in 2018 the government allocated approximately $70 million to study its feasibility. But last February, Canada\u2019s Environment Minister announced the government would no longer invest in major, new road construction.

            "The underlying idea of the internet of animals is to tune into the planet\u2019s hidden phenomena \u2014 the flight paths followed by sharp-shinned hawks, the precise fates befalling Arctic terns that die young, the exact landscape requirements of critically endangered saiga antelope \u2014 by attaching tiny, solar-powered tracking devices, some weighing less than a paperclip, to all kinds of organisms and even some inanimate objects (glaciers, ocean plastic debris). The inexpensive, globe-spanning system of animal tagging is meant to help scientists understand the precise drivers of global change, and much more, by tracking thousands of tagged animals from space and tying their experiences to the broader impacts facing whole populations or even species.",
            "BQBeginning sometime next year, the ICARUS project plans to launch receivers on five low-cost miniature satellites.",
            "Wikelski, the director of the Department of Migration at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, in Germany, said the prospect of having that data, and of \u201cmaking people aware of the incredible beauty and richness of what\u2019s happening out there,\u201d has made the effort worthwhile, even urgent. It\u2019s also true, as he wrote in his recent book The Internet of Animals: Discovering the Collective Intelligence of Life on Earth, that he \u201chad no clue how many pitfalls there would be\u2026 how many times when we desperately wanted to give up, because the whole process had become so exquisitely frustrating that we just couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.\u201d",
            "In 2018, after years of working with designers, engineers, and government officials from multiple countries and continents, Wikelski\u2019s team saw its ICARUS receiver launch aboard a Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station, where Russian cosmonauts attached it to their side of the orbiting lab. \u201cWe danced, cried, and hugged one another,\u201d Wikelski wrote of the launch. \u201cAll the stress of nearly 20 years fell away.\u201d",
            "The internet of animals went live in March 2020, but before the year was out, mechanical issues on the Russian ISS module took the system down. Nearly a year passed before it was up and running again. By the spring of 2021, the system was finally humming along, receiving data from roughly 3,500 tagged animals around the world. But then, in the winter of 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, and the West cut ties with Russia. ICARUS\u2019s transmission of data abruptly halted.\n",

            "After the ISS failure, Wikelski\u2019s team set out to redesign the system to use satellite-based receivers, which had always been its long-term aim. In 2022, plans seemed almost set for an ICARUS receiver to orbit on the next GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite, a joint venture between NASA and the German space agency, scheduled to launch in 2028. But last-minute political haggling siphoned more than a third of the project\u2019s German funding, leaving no money to include ICARUS. \u201cWe were totally devastated,\u201d Wikelski recalled. He gave his project three months to find a solution or finally give up. \u201cThat\u2019s when we scaled down and said, we need a CubeSat.\u201d",
            "And so beginning sometime next year, the project plans to launch ICARUS receivers on five relatively low-cost CubeSats \u2014 miniature satellites roughly the size of a Rubik\u2019s cube and weighing only a couple of pounds \u2014 using private launch companies. Funded by the Max Planck Society, the system will cost roughly $1.57 million to launch and have annual operating expenses of around $160,000.\n",
            "\u201cThe geopolitical aspect of this is pretty huge,\u201d said Michael Wunder, a quantitative ecologist at the University of Colorado Denver who used the ISS tags to study the migration patterns of mountain plovers before the war in Ukraine cut off the research. Instead of involving government space agencies, the project\u2019s new iteration keeps the scientists in control.\n",
            "BQTiny tags record animals\u2019 movements and body temperature, as well as air temperature, air pressure, and wind speed.",
            "The new system allows for greater global coverage \u2014 the ISS receiver couldn\u2019t communicate with tags at the planet\u2019s highest latitudes \u2014 and Wikelski\u2019s team has used the intervening years to shrink the tags by several grams and design new ways for animals to \u201cwear\u201d them, vastly expanding the number of species scientists can study. The team is currently upgrading 4,000 older tags to work with the new system. The tags provide hourly accounts of the animal\u2019s energy expenditure; measure environmental factors like air pressure, altitude, temperature, and humidity; and even use AI to help interpret the animal\u2019s behavior.",
            "The trove of data \u201cwill open a lot of doors for researchers,\u201d said Ashley Lohr, who coordinates North American projects for ICARUS through the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. \u201cHow stressed was the animal? What were the environmental conditions when the animal was at this place at this time?\u201d\n",
            "Wunder\u2019s lab group tagged 17 mountain plovers in Colorado in 2021. Native to the plains of the north-central United Staes, the species has declined by 80 percent in the past six decades. But the birds are hard to study because of their habitat and behavior. \u201cThey\u2019re singing and vociferous but not in your face,\u201d Wunder said, and in breeding season they like their space, living in densities of only about three birds per square kilometer. The plovers often occupy private ranchlands, which makes them hard to find without trespassing. And they breed in late March and April, while bird surveys, timed to count migratory songbirds, happen in May.\n",

            "fCBiologist Martin Wikelski tags a scarlet macaw with an ICARUS transmitter.\nCourtesy of Martin Wikelski",
            "Wunder has long sought to understand whether mountain plovers follow distinct, structured migration patterns or whether birds from different areas mix together in winter flocks. He also wants to learn what drives the birds to migrate. \u201cAre they moving away from something or toward something else?\u201d he asks. He also hopes to determine exactly where the birds are running into trouble.",
            "Before the ISS receiver went dark in 2022, the ICARUS tags revealed that the plovers didn\u2019t follow fixed migration routes and that birds from around the country were mingling in the winter. When several transmitting birds died, Wunder was able to dispatch researchers to their locations and discover the cause of death \u2014 predation. The birds started returning to Colorado in February, and Wunder was eager to see which ones would come back \u2014 but then the war in Ukraine began. \u201cWe were cut off, there was no more information,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Ellen Aikens, a biologist at the University of Wyoming who did her postdoctoral research on animal migration at the Max Planck Institute, believes that ICARUS could serve as a \u201cdemocratizing force\u201d in ecology and biology. It\u2019s a way to level the playing field, she says, so that \u201cfolks that have a smaller budget or are working on species that are a bit more obscure and there\u2019s not as much funding behind can start to get the same kind of information, baseline info, about where those [animals] are going.\u201d\n",
            "BQAs animals travel, says one expert, they can collect environmental information that can better inform climate models.",
            "In her lab, Aikens is studying golden eagles using a tag made by the German company e-obs. \u201cIt\u2019s the gold standard of biologging in bird research, if you can afford it and your bird is big enough to carry the transformer\u201d \u2014 like geese, storks, and eagles. A single e-obs tag costs more than $1,500 and works over a cellular network, meaning researchers must also pay the cost of data transmission for as long as the animal lives. \u201cIf you want to get a good sample size that will allow you to publish your research, that adds up really quickly,\u201d Aikens said. \u201cICARUS tags are cheaper by an order of magnitude.\u201d",
            "Aikens believes that ICARUS will help transform the way scientists study animals. Our nonhuman neighbors \u201ccan take a pulse of the planet and be detectors of change and help us understand the health of the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cAs [animals] move these vast distances, they can collect detailed environmental information that can better inform climate models and collect information in places that are difficult to monitor,\u201d whether high in the sky, deep in the ocean, or under a thick layer of ice.",
            "ICARUS tags are solar-powered, whereas some existing tagging systems run on batteries, which can die \u2014 ending the research on that individual or requiring recapture to change them out. Other tagging systems rely on animals passing by a signal tower. It works for certain animals, like birds and bats, but not for others. \u201cBecause ICARUS is satellite-powered, you don\u2019t have to wait for your animal to go back on the grid and pass by a tower,\u201d said Lohr. Instead, each time a satellite passes over an area, data from nearby tagged animals will be uploaded to Movebank, an open-access database.",

            "Ultimately, researchers hope that ICARUS data can \u201chelp us pinpoint effective conservation strategies,\u201d Aikens said. \u201cIt can help us identify pinch points on the landscape.\u201d While this is already happening for some species, including North American ungulates like elk and pronghorn antelope, whose migrations researchers have tracked for years, for most of the planet\u2019s species \u201cwe lack this data and this wide coverage of information, which makes these fine-scale interventions a lot harder to achieve. That\u2019s a place that ICARUS can help fill in a lot of gaps.\u201d\n",
            "And if the internet of animals can zero in on specific issues \u2014 for instance, a bird species dying out because a particular insect it eats is being killed by a particular chemical being sprayed in an area \u2014 Wikelski believes such information could drive people to act. \u201cPeople are willing to do something about it if they know that what they do is really helpful,\u201d he said.\n",
            "For now, Wikelski continues to practice patience. When I spoke to him in early July, he was dealing with the latest hurdle: satellite launch delays, including one caused by a payload issue and another caused by an ill-timed summer holiday that delayed authorization of the $30,000 payment needed to secure a launch reservation. \u201cOur project is now too small to really be on everybody\u2019s horizon,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, it was too large.\u201d",
            "Nevertheless, Wikelski was hopeful. His team was studying and perfecting the lowest-stress methods of tagging animals and even testing automatic tagging systems, like one for deer involving a salt lick and a tiny elastic band. He remained confident of ICARUS\u2019s potential.",
            "\u201cOne really important aspect we think is transformative in biology is the scaling up of tagging,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have one animal but 50 or 100, or you do it across a continent.\u201d Over the next two years he plans to tag 9,000 animals in Europe, including blackbirds, storm thrushes, swifts, and sparrows in a study already underway. Roughly 7,000 of those 9,000 would die in the first year, he said, based on general patterns. \u201cThat means we are finally understanding where they disappear. Where are the death traps? These tags are so smart, they can tell us if a female is nesting and if the clutch disappears. So we can not only get information on where the adults are living and dying, but have the adults been successful in hatching or clutching? Is there a massive problem in a certain area? Then we can link individuals to populations and understand the drivers of change.\u201d"

            "With a plan for green infrastructure to drain some 9,500 acres across the city, the Philadelphia Water Department was considered by many to be at the cutting edge of stormwater management \u2014 an increasingly urgent challenge for city governments amid the bigger, more frequent rainstorms now occurring as a result of climate change, especially in the northeastern United States.\n",
            "The program led Philadelphia and other U.S. cities to install nature-based solutions to absorb and filter rainfall alongside traditional \u201cgray infrastructure,\u201d such as pipes, tunnels, and pump stations. Yet while other cities, such as Milwaukee and Boston, saw green measures as complements to gray infrastructure, Philadelphia placed rain gardens and bioswales \u2014 vegetated ditches that collect stormwater \u2014 at the center of its strategy. But now, critics say, these innovations are proving inadequate at handling the increase in extreme rainfall events. In fact, the amount of overflow from pipes that combine stormwater with raw sewage has actually increased since the Green Cities program began.\n",
            "BQGray infrastructure can take decades to implement and cost billions of dollars, but many cities don\u2019t have much of a choice.",
            "An average of 14 billion gallons of polluted stormwater have overflowed from Philadelphia\u2019s 164 sewage outfall pipes each year since Green City, Clean Waters began, according to \u201cUnraveling the Facts\u201d a new report from the Restore the River Advocacy Team, a group of water experts and environmentalists that includes the former heads of the interstate Delaware River Basin Commission and the Camden County Municipal Utilities Authority, which manages wastewater in the southern New Jersey county.",

But its storage tunnels and tanks have done the most to reduce combined sewer overflows into Lake Michigan and local rivers, said Kevin Shafer, the district\u2019s executive director. He estimated that the system\u2019s gray infrastructure can currently handle two and a half to three inches of rain at a time, while green measures can absorb only about half an inch.",
            "Still, he calls green infrastructure \u201cthe icing on the cake\u201d because managing water where it falls protects water bodies from contaminants like bacteria, heavy metals, and trash, and it reduces the risk of basement backups. \u201cYou have to have both,\u201d he said.\n",
            "Despite its limited finances and aging infrastructure, Milwaukee\u2019s sewerage district has set a goal of eliminating combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2035. \u201cWith the changing climate we\u2019re facing,\u201d Shafer has said, \u201cit\u2019s like running uphill, and the hill keeps getting steeper and steeper.\u201d\n",
            "Boston, too, has emphasized gray infrastructure in its efforts to upgrade stormwater management. The city is operating under a long-term control plan \u2014 a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be \u201cfishable and swimmable.\u201d To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",

            "But according to Max Rome, stormwater program manager for the nonprofit Charles River Watershed Association, the control plan\u2019s current goal may be impossible to meet. In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan.",
            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn\u2019t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.\u201d\n",
            "In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050\u2019s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That\u2019s above the watershed\u2019s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet.\n",
            "Increased rainfall is also affecting Western cities, including Portland, Oregon, which sharply reduced pollution in the downtown section of the Willamette River and Columbia Slough by building three tunnels to hold stormwater flows.

When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",

            "But we can tell at the population level. As with COVID, you look at the number of deaths during a particular time period, compare it with earlier time periods when there wasn\u2019t an epidemic, when there wasn\u2019t a heat wave, and that gives you a relatively accurate count of excess deaths.

This emphasis on whether it\u2019s going to be livable doesn\u2019t take into account the creativity of human beings. We live in all kinds of environments that are not livable. People live in Antarctica for several months a year. Humans have found ways to modify infrastructure, to modify clothing, behavioral patterns, to be able to survive in very extreme conditions.

            "Last September, a small white aircraft with an unusual design took off from Maribor Airport, in Slovenia. The two pilots were not seated front and center; instead, they steered the plane in a capsule attached far out on the right wing. The plane had some other unusual features. On the far-left wing, another slender capsule contained a tank of so-called cryogenic hydrogen, cooled to minus 253 degrees Celsius, or minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. A fuel cell inside the plane caused the liquid hydrogen to react with oxygen, producing water and enough electricity to power an electric motor with the propeller attached. The plane flew not with fossil fuel, but with hydrogen.",
            "The \u201cHY4,\u201d as the aircraft is called, circled the southeastern foothills of the Alps for a total of more than three hours that day \u2014 a major success, according to Josef Kallo, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Ulm in Germany and CEO of H2Fly, a startup based in Stuttgart. \u201cWe have flown with hydrogen many times before, but now we were able to demonstrate all the processes required for a flight of more than 1,000 kilometers,\u201d Kallo says. His goal is to make so-called \u201cgreen hydrogen,\u201d produced by wind and solar farms, the new standard fuel in aviation. \u201cHydrogen is the most efficient fuel that can be made using renewable energies,\u201d he says.",
            "BQThe aviation industry finds itself in the midst of a struggle over how to clear its reputation as a leading climate polluter. ",
            "The small plane is only a first step. Kallo is also working on an experimental version of the world\u2019s first hydrogen passenger plane in partnership with Deutsche Aircraft, a manufacturer of medium-sized Dornier aircraft, and the German Aerospace Center. \u201cWe want to demonstrate this technology in a 40-seater powered with liquid hydrogen by 2026,\u201d he says. His dream for the 2030s is that hydrogen propulsion will be able \u201cto truly decarbonize at least half of global air traffic.\u201d",
            "The successful test flight is one of many signs that aviation is going through a deep technological shake-up. Mitigating CO2 emissions and climate impact has become one of the top priorities in the industry, experts say. Governments, private companies, and scientists across the world are ramping up sustainable aviation research, trying to find new, more efficient designs for planes and engines and to use recyclable materials. Fuels are at the center of this shake-up. Jet fuel made of fossil kerosene needs to be replaced. But with what?",
            "H2Fly\u2019s Josef Kallo and other experts are convinced that in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 a deep technological transformation is needed \u2014 away from oily liquids like kerosene to hydrogen, a carbon-free fuel so far used only in space flights. At least two other startup companies, U.S.-based Universal Hydrogen and U.K.-based ZeroAvia, are pursuing this goal, too. ZeroAvia calls hydrogen-electric propulsion systems \u201cthe only alternative propulsion system that can deliver the range, payload, and emissions elimination required by the market.\u201d",

            "But hydrogen\u2019s future role is far from clear. Airlines would need to buy hydrogen planes at a massive scale, and airports would have to make huge upfront investments in new hydrogen infrastructure, including pipelines, tanks, and filling stations for the frigid liquid.",
            "In fact, a strong faction within the global aviation industry outright rejects that hydrogen can become a meaningful alternative to kerosene within the next 25 years. \u201cIt is arithmetically impossible to replace the world\u2019s fleets with hydrogen-powered airplanes in time\u201d to meet the industry\u2019s climate-neutrality target, Christopher Raymond, chief sustainability officer of Boeing, claims. The U.S.-based company is the archrival of the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of airliners, Europe-based Airbus. Raymond argues that, in a best-case scenario, \u201chydrogen-powered aircraft may make a small contribution to moderating emissions in 2050.\u201d For now, the aviation industry finds itself in the midst of a struggle over how to clear its reputation as a leading climate polluter.",
            "Globally, aviation contributes about 2.5 percent to energy-related CO2 emissions, a sizeable share. Contrails and nitrous oxides, byproducts of burning fossil fuels at high altitudes, also contribute to heating Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans, and they could even triple aviation\u2019s climate impact, according to a widely cited 2021 study by Manchester Metropolitan University in the U.K.",

Studies project a further increase driven mainly by travelers and airlines from newly prosperous countries in the Global South.",
            "Instead of introducing hydrogen as a new fuel, Boeing\u2019s Christopher Raymond and many others in the aviation industry are betting on a much less disruptive strategy for achieving climate neutrality. \u201cSustainable Aviation Fuels,\u201d or SAFs, are chemically almost identical to fossil kerosene, but they are made from today\u2019s animal waste and plant biomass. Boeing claims that SAF \u201clowers carbon emissions over the fuel\u2019s life cycle by up to 80 percent, depending on the feedstock.\u201d Another advantage of SAFs is that they are \u201cdrop in\u201d fuels, meaning they can be easily incorporated into existing airport fueling systems. In a sign of progress, an experimental Boeing 787 run by Virgin Atlantic flew from London to New York last November with 100 percent fuel made from a mix of waste fats and waste plant sugars. It was the first flight of its kind and a major milestone.",

            "But overall, rollout of SAF has been slow. In 2023, the aviation industry purchased only 500,000 tons, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents 380 airlines. That\u2019s twice as much as in 2022, but still only a miniscule 0.2 percent of the 286 million tons of fossil fuel combusted in planes that year.",
            "Regulators currently allow planes to burn fuel mixtures that contain a maximum of 50 percent SAF, though engineers are retrofitting engines to burn a larger share. Boeing has said that all its new planes will be able to fly with pure SAF by 2030. Deutsche Aircraft, a manufacturer of medium-sized planes, plans to introduce a SAF-only plane, the Dornier 328eco, to the market in 2026 according to Riaan Myburgh, the company\u2019s chief engineer for research and technology. \u201cSAF really is the short-term and even medium-term solution,\u201d he says.",
            "Two problems cast a big shadow: SAF\u2019s availability and its carbon footprint. While most SAFs are currently derived mainly from animal and industrial waste, IATA has called for algae, waste biomass from forestry, agriculture, and municipal waste to be added to the feedstock of refineries as fast as possible. With such a diverse feedstock, however, achieving and proving carbon-neutrality will be difficult. Any kind of biomass feedstock will generate CO2 emissions, for example when energy-intensive fertilizer or diesel tractors and trucks are used in industrial agriculture.",
            "BQBy 2028, says an engineer, the industry must make \u201cits most important decisions on how to become climate neutral.\u201d",
            "That\u2019s also true for so-called \u201celectro-SAF,\u201d which is made by splitting hydrogen from water using renewable energy. This hydrogen is then combined in refineries with carbon from biomass or from industrial exhaust gases to form synthetic kerosene. The process, also called \u201cPower to Liquid,\u201d can only become truly climate-neutral when the necessary carbon is captured directly from the atmosphere using wind or solar power, a technology not yet tested or available at scale.",
            "Against this backdrop, proponents of \u201cgreen hydrogen\u201d fuel like H2Fly\u2019s Josef Kallo argue that the best way to move forward is to take carbon out of the equation altogether and simply use pure hydrogen made with renewable electricity as fuel.\n",
            "Bj\u00f6rn Nagel, a 47-year-old aviation engineer and director of the Hamburg-based Institute of System Architectures in Aeronautics, has looked at aviation\u2019s big existential questions from every possible angle in the past years. As head of a team of 60 scientists, he spends his days zipping between virtual reality animations of future planes, experimental robotic assembly lines, rooms crammed with expensive machinery, and meetings with scientists and aircraft manufacturers.

            "From his research lab on the banks of the Elbe River, Nagel can see the global aircraft production chain in action. Regularly, huge cargo planes appear on the horizon and descend toward a nearby airport, carrying fuselages, wings, and other large plane parts built elsewhere across Europe for his next-door neighbor, Airbus. About half of all the company\u2019s new A320 jets are assembled here.",
            "This proximity increases Nagel\u2019s sense of urgency. \u201cBy 2028,\u201d he says, \u201cthe global aircraft industry must have made its most important decisions on how to become climate neutral.\u201d It takes about seven years to develop a new type of plane, and after becoming operational, these planes will remain in service for 30 to 40 years. \u201cIt\u2019s a race with time,\u201d he says.",
            "Nagel led one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive studies of aviation\u2019s climate strategies, a project called \u201cEXACT,\u201d in which 165 scientists from 20 institutes compared, among other things, how airports around the world \u2014 Tokyo, Dubai, and Frankfurt among them \u2014 could be supplied with either SAF or hydrogen and how their environmental impacts would differ. They examined how to reduce contrails and nitrous oxide emissions most efficiently, and they came up with futuristic new plane designs, including one with a staggering 10 electric engines and propellers.",
            "BQSustainable fuel might not be available in large enough quantities, and harvesting it could harm vulnerable ecosystems.",
            "The studies underscored the challenges of using hydrogen as aviation fuel. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that you can\u2019t just put a hydrogen tank in an airplane and fly off,\u201d Nagel says. New materials are needed to build the planes because tiny hydrogen atoms easily leak and tend to make anything they touch brittle. Nagel acknowledges that deep changes to aircraft architecture are necessary. Computer-simulated hydrogen planes developed in the EXACT study don\u2019t have their fuel tanks spread out in the wings, as current planes do. Instead, they are designed to be nearly spherical, to reduce their surface area and the weight of the insulation needed to keep hydrogen fuel in its cryogenic state. One option under consideration is to place them in the plane\u2019s tail, which would affect the plane\u2019s overall weight balance. ",
            "Fuel cells must also become much lighter and more efficient than they are today. In terms of climate impact, the most important open question is to what extent hydrogen \u2014 which only produces water vapor as an exhaust \u2014 causes contrails. A project is under way in cooperation with Airbus, in which research planes fly behind passenger jets to determine the effects. For SAF, a considerable reduction could be shown compared to fossil jet fuel, since due to their higher chemical purity, SAFs emit much less of the soot that causes contrails.\n",
            "But SAF still has strong downsides. \u201cUsing hydrogen to first synthesize kerosene\u201d \u2014 as in the Power to Liquid process, says Nagel \u2014 \u201cconsumes up to 45 percent more primary energy than using hydrogen directly as a fuel, a huge number.\u201d",

            "fC\nYale Environment 360",
            "Also, the biomass needed for SAF might simply not be available in large enough quantities in the future, and harvesting and collecting it could harm vulnerable ecosystems. In terms of cost, liquid hydrogen fuel will require higher initial investments, Nagel says, but it should come out on par or cheaper than SAFs when their biomass demand, and the high cost of direct air capture of carbon, are figured in. When critics point out that hydrogen requires four times the volume per unit of energy as kerosene, Nagel answers that it weighs three times less. \u201cAccording to our calculations, this largely cancels each other out,\u201d he says.\n",
            "Nagel admits that many challenges remain. \u201cThe devil is in the details\u201d is a phrase he often uses. Overall, he has concluded that hydrogen, if made with electricity from renewable sources, has enough advantages to become the fuel of the future, with SAF and \u201celectro-SAF\u201d filling in for some time to come and for certain demands.",
            "BQAirbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen-powered plane fit to transport passengers to the market by 2035. ",
            "Nagel is convinced that hydrogen\u2019s technological challenges can be resolved. With that goal, his institute is turning a ground-based A320 jet into a \u201cHydrogen Aviation Lab\u201d at Hamburg airport to test components and create a filling station for hydrogen fuel made by the region\u2019s wind farms, in a project run by Lufthansa Technik. The German Aerospace Center is also involved in turning a Dornier 328 into a flying test bed for hydrogen-electric propulsion, and it is testing direct hydrogen combustion engines in Cologne.",
            "But like all big players, the research agency is hedging its bets on aviation\u2019s future. It is also researching Power to Liquid technologies, for which a pilot plant will be built in Eastern Germany. And in the U.S., Boeing is pursuing research on hydrogen propulsion. \u201cWe know it will take an \u2018SAF and\u2019 approach and not an \u2018SAF or\u2019 approach to achieving net-zero by 2050,\u201d Boeing\u2019s Raymond concedes.",
            "Given Boeing\u2019s current massive quality problems with its existing fleet, it is safe to say that hydrogen propulsion will either be developed in Europe, or nowhere. \u201cWe\u2019d like to work with all aircraft manufacturers on hydrogen but it is clear that Boeing has a different focus right now,\u201d Nagel says. In contrast, Airbus has committed to introducing a hydrogen plane fit to transport passengers to the market by 2035. At the Dubai air show last December, Airbus\u2019 chief sustainability officer, Julie Kitcher, radiated optimism when she said that hydrogen propulsion is moving towards \u201ctechnological readiness.\u201d In January, the company opened a brand-new R&D center for hydrogen technologies in Stade, some 40 kilometers north of Hamburg down the Elbe River."

Outside Russia \u2014 where Moscow geologist Vladimir Larin was making the case half a century ago that we live on a \u201cprimordially hydrogen-rich planet\u201d \u2014 few researchers showed much interest in exploring whether that assumption was true. \n",

So, even if the gas was present in a sample, it would not be detected. He says this helps explain why, among more than 100,000 gas samples analyzed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), only eight recorded hydrogen at significant concentrations.\n",

Many reserves will be too deep or remote to tap easily \u2014 around hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean, for instance. But if Ellis is right, then just a small fraction could meet the world\u2019s needs for centuries.

Zgonnik argues that capturing natural hydrogen as it is generated underground could have the opposite effect, reducing warming.

            "Texas is by far the top emitter of greenhouse gases in the United States: The oil-rich state releases twice as much carbon dioxide as the runner-up state, California, and as much as the entire country of Germany.",
            "But the air in Texas may soon get a slight reprieve. Last April, the Texas-based company 1PointFive broke ground on a direct air capture facility called Stratos that, by 2025, aims to absorb 500,000 metric tons of atmospheric CO2 each year. That\u2019s 125 times more CO2 than the next-largest direct air capture plant.\n",
            "The concept of direct air capture has been around for decades. In the face of skyrocketing global temperatures and CO2 levels, the idea is simple: remove some of that CO2 from the air and either bury it underground or turn it into a saleable product. After years of lab tests and experiments, these efforts  started to gain commercial traction a few years ago. Now, direct air capture is seriously ramping up, with about 20 plants in operation across Europe, Canada, and the U.S., where the Department of Energy is funding four regional direct air capture hubs. Globally, more than 100 plants are at some stage of development.\n",
            "Though the concept is simple, there are still plenty of hurdles. Building and operating an air capture plant is about 50 times more expensive than planting trees per ton of CO2 taken up. Researchers are working hard to come up with new materials and systems to lower that price tag, encouraged by government prize money and rising tax breaks and carbon credits.",
            "BQPulling CO2 straight from the air is expensive, but it can be done nearly anywhere, with easily quantifiable results.",
            "Those incentives are important given the second major issue: scale. The plants in operation today together capture just 10,000 metric tons of CO2 a year. The largest of these \u2014 a project called Orca, run in Iceland by Climeworks \u2014 soaks up 4,000 metric tons per year. But the International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) pathway to net zero by 2050 calls for pulling 80 million metric tons of CO2 from the air annually by 2030, and more than a billion metric tons by 2050. That will involve a herculean effort, requiring tens of megaton-scale plants to be built per year. Stratos would be just the first.",

While the world ramps up installations of wind and solar to replace the burning of fossil fuels, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that carbon dioxide removal, while not a substitute for deep emissions reductions, \u201cis part of all modelled scenarios that limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or lower by 2100.\u201d",

Planting and protecting forests and other ecosystems \u2014 called nature-based solutions \u2014 is relatively cheap, can be done at large scale, and has a heap of side benefits, including the provision of habitat for endangered species, flood protection, or increased food supplies for humans. The IPCC\u2019s 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C calculated that up to 11 billion metric tons of CO2 could be drawn down in this manner per year by 2050, a huge chunk of today\u2019s roughly 35 billion metric tons in emissions. But the amount of carbon stored by nature can be hard to estimate and uncertain: A wildfire can wipe out a forest, for example.\n",
            "According to the IEA, capturing CO2 directly from the flue stacks of power plants and other industrial operations, like concrete plants, which are hard-to-mitigate sectors, should be used to soak up nearly 4 billion metric tons of CO2 a year by 2050. But these methods don\u2019t touch legacy CO2, which is more dilute in the atmosphere. Pulling CO2 straight from the air is expensive, but it can be done nearly anywhere, with easily quantifiable results. The IEA target of roughly 1 billion metric tons by 2050 is a smaller but still substantial slice of the pie.",
            "BQOnce CO2 is captured, companies need to decide what to do with it: bury it or use it to make a product.",
            "Today, there are two main strategies for air capture, each of which involves large fans that pull air into a processing area. The first strategy absorbs CO2 onto a solid filter; then a combination of low pressure and moderate temperatures (around 90 degrees C) pulls the concentrated CO2 back out. This process has a relatively high energy requirement, but the biggest plant currently using it \u2014 Climework\u2019s Orca \u2014 makes use of geothermal energy. The capture units \u2014 Orca\u2019s resemble industrial air conditioners the size of a shipping container \u2014 are typically modular, so a capture facility can host just a handful of these units, or many, and be placed basically anywhere there\u2019s ready access to renewable energy.",
            "The second strategy absorbs CO2 into a liquid, transfers the CO2 to limestone pellets, and uses very high temperatures (about 600 degrees C) \u2014 typically supplied by a fossil-fuel-powered furnace \u2014 to remove the CO2 and recover the reagents. The CO2 released from the furnace can be captured too. This system requires a lot of water. But the chemical process is well suited to very large operations. This technique, as developed by the British Columbia-based company Carbon Engineering, is powering Stratos.",
            "Other options are available. The California-based company Heirloom, which opened the first commercial air capture plant in the U.S. last November, with a capacity of 1,000 metric tons a year, uses a variant on the limestone technology. The company simply exposes trays of powdered calcium oxide to air to soak up CO2 and turn it into limestone. Like the other limestone technique, the Heirloom process also releases CO2 from the limestone using high temperatures, but this facility uses renewable energy to do so.",

            "All of this is costly. Businesses can currently buy carbon credits online from Climeworks at the startling price of $1,500 per metric ton. That\u2019s extremely expensive; other voluntary carbon credits \u2014 from schemes that plant trees or make industry more efficient and less polluting, for example \u2014 can be purchased for tens of dollars per metric ton. But these credits are still attractive because they are easily quantifiable, verifiable, and durable over long time periods. Microsoft announced in 2022 that it bought 10,000 metric tons of credits from Climeworks in a 10-year deal, though it did not disclose the price. 1PointFive has deals in place to sell credits to Amazon, Airbus, and other companies once it\u2019s up and running.",
            "Of course, the commercial selling price of carbon credits isn\u2019t the same as the company\u2019s cost of capture. That is surely lower, but numbers are hard to pin down; Climeworks won\u2019t disclose specifics but says $1,000 per metric ton is in the ballpark. The IEA estimates that the operational costs of direct air capture should get to between $230 and $630 per metric ton of CO2 once scaled up, depending in large part on energy costs, says Mathilde Fajardy, an IEA analyst. Others are less optimistic. According to Howard Herzog, of MIT\u2019s Energy Initiative, a reasonable estimate for the cost of direct air capture by 2030 is between $600 and $1,000 per metric ton of CO2. \u201cMost estimates out there are unrealistic,\u201d he says.",
            "BQAbout three-quarters of globally captured C02 is currently being used for enhanced oil recovery, which is controversial. ",
            "To tackle both cost and energy use, the DOE\u2019s Carbon Negative Shot program, launched in 2021, ambitiously aims to get the cost of direct air capture below $100 per metric ton by sponsoring technology innovation. That price would make air capture profitable against, for example, a U.S. tax credit that, as of 2022, offers $180 per metric ton for large-scale stored CO2.",
            "Last December, the DOE put up more than $1 million in prize money for promising direct air capture technologies. There are seven semi-finalists. Elysia Labs, in Phoenix, for example, is developing a nanofiber-based sorbent that needs less of a pressure drop and thus requires less energy to pull CO2 from the air. And N\u016bxsen, in New York City, is developing an electrochemical cell that it says can capture and release CO2 without energy-intensive heat or pressure changes; the company plans to use small modular nuclear reactors to power its system.",
            "Meanwhile, some researchers are using artificial intelligence to accelerate innovation.

            "Yet once CO2 is captured, companies need to decide what to do with it. The most carbon-negative option is to bury it deep underground. This is what Climeworks does in Iceland, for example, and plans to do with its upgraded facility, called Mammoth, due to launch this year. There are plenty of suitable geological repositories for buried CO2. But for now, this strategy is in the minority: the IEA reports that as of 2022, out of 18 plants operating globally, only two \u2014 both run by Climeworks in Iceland \u2014 bury their CO2.",
            "The other option is to use captured CO2 to make a product \u2014 like fertilizer, for example \u2014 or use it to carbonize beverages or as an ingredient in other industrial chemicals. This is what the majority of direct air capture plants do today. Heirloom, for example, works with a partner company to use its captured CO2 in making concrete. The biggest potential future market could be synthetic fuels for airplanes, wherein captured CO2 is combined with green hydrogen (made by splitting water with renewable electricity) to make synthetic hydrocarbons. The Norsk e-fuel project in Norway, the Haru Oni efuels plant in Chile, the AtmosFUEL project in the U.K., and Carbon Engineering, in Canada, are among companies pursuing this end use. In the IEA\u2019s pathway to net zero, about 35 percent of air-captured CO2 gets used for synthetic fuels by 2050, while the rest is buried.",
            "BQThe energy it takes to power capture, says one critic, would be better spent replacing fossil-fuel-based electricity.",
            "For now, though, about three-quarters of all globally captured CO2 (which comes mainly from industrial flue stacks) is currently being used for enhanced oil recovery, says Fajardy. The CO2 gets injected into oil wells to both bury it and to help push out more oil. This is controversial, as many note that it doesn\u2019t disincentivize fossil fuels. \u201cEnhanced oil recovery has been a stepping stone for early carbon capture and storage projects to help with the economics,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cIf your primary goal is negative emissions, it is not a good fit.\u201d But supporters point out that it\u2019s still burying CO2: If done carefully, they claim, then even after burning the recovered oil the process can come out as a net zero or even a net negative equation for carbon, though that\u2019s hard to quantify.",
            "What will happen to Stratos\u2019 CO2 hasn\u2019t yet been decided. The plant\u2019s location in Texas, and the fact that the companies building it, 1PointFive and Carbon Engineering, are both owned by Occidental Petroleum, has led some to speculate that this project will be used for enhanced oil recovery. Kel Coulson, Carbon Engineering\u2019s director of policy, says Stratos has several options for its CO2, including burying it in saline reservoirs or producing low-carbon products, which they call \u201cnet-zero oil.\u201d \u201cThe ultimate use of captured CO2 from Stratos will be driven by customer preference,\u201d Coulson says.",

            "Despite such criticism, the industry is moving forward. Last August, the DOE selected two megaton-scale projects for funding: another 1PointFive venture in Kleberg County, Texas, and an effort in Louisiana called Project Cypress, which has announced it will not participate in enhanced oil recovery. Two more hubs will follow from the DOE. And a handful of other megaton-scale efforts are planned elsewhere, including a Carbon Engineering effort in the United Arab Emirates and Project Bison in Wyoming, which is aiming to capture an ambitious 5 megatons a year by 2030.",
            "If all 100-plus projects on the drawing board go ahead as planned, they\u2019ll capture around 70 metric megatons of CO2 by 2030, says the IEA. That\u2019s very close to their 80 metric megaton target. But it\u2019s also a very big if."

That means capturing the equivalent of the annual exhaust of 3.3 billion gasoline-powered cars for 80 years. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a one solution problem,\u201d says Nicholas Ward, an earth scientist at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need that 15-gigaton solution that\u2019s going to solve all of our emissions problems \u2014 we need a tool bag of a bunch of five-percent solutions.\u201d",

For billions of years, the ocean has been absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, reducing it to different forms of carbon that circulate via currents or settle to the seafloor. Today, the ocean soaks up 30 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, a capacity that is 42 times greater than the atmosphere\u2019s. Running Tide wants to take advantage of this system by \u201cdeploying\u201d timber industry \u201cwood waste,\u201d which is often sold as feedstock to be burned for bioenergy or simply left to rot \u2014 processes that release the wood\u2019s stored carbon back into the air.",

Although scientists and governments seem more alarmed by atmospheric geoengineering efforts, like altering the reflective capacity of the sky with injections of sulfur dioxide, they have also expressed concerns about mCDR, if only because it is so little understood. Iceland\u2019s small size, and its acknowledgement of the urgency of the climate crisis, have made it an ideal incubator for mCDR science. But the IPCC\u2019s and other groups\u2019 increasingly dire warnings about the need to act now, and to act in a multitude of ways that include mCDR, has been loud enough to get the attention of much larger governments, including the Biden administration.",

Reducing the acidity of seawater increases its alkalinity; the higher its alkalinity, the more atmospheric CO2 it can absorb and transform into stabler, inorganic carbon, which is less likely to seep back into the air. Since last year, the company Ebb Carbon has been operating its OAE system at the Sequin campus, filtering seawater through a series of membranes that, when pulsed with electricity, extract its acid. With its federal grant, Ward says, the lab will be testing OAE methods from a handful of other companies.\n",

Such facilities, according to Eisaman, yield around 40 billion gallons of brine a day, globally, most of which is discharged into the sea. \u201cIf you convert all that salt to alkalinity with the process we\u2019re pursuing,\u201d he says, more than 1 billion tons of CO2 are pulled from the air and stored in the ocean per year. To reduce acidification at oceanic scales would be impossible, but Eisaman says that isn\u2019t Ebb Carbon\u2019s goal. He pointed to the oyster farms in the bays and estuaries around Sequin that have been suffering from acidification, which thins the shells of bivalves. \u201cYou could use this to kind of keep that relatively small local body of water similar to a preindustrial equilibrium that is ideal for shellfish.\u201d ",
            "Instead of using electricity to shock the acid from seawater, other companies are experimenting with alkaline rocks, like basalt or olivine, which over thousands of years break down and make their way into the oceans. To speed up that natural process, often called \u201cenhanced rock weathering,\u201d the material can be mined, pulverized, and mixed into the ocean. Eisaman argues that \u201copen systems\u201d like this, which use the Earth\u2019s own carbon cycle instead of \u201cclosed systems\u201d like direct air capture, are \u201capproaches that will have the potential to scale gigatons and at low cost.\u201d (Running Tide also coats its wood chips with an alkaline material, with the goal of simultaneously transferring CO2 to the ocean and combating acidification.)",

            "At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, scientists will be using their portion of the SEA-CO2 funding to develop sensors that can be attached to scientific moorings and autonomous underwater vehicles to continuously measure carbon concentrations in seawater. Such sensors would benefit companies that aim to grow macroalgae \u2014 seaweed and kelp \u2014 that draw large amounts of CO2 from the air, then sink them into the deep ocean. But some scientists say such efforts are risky. As it breaks down in the water column, this biomass produces organic carbon that \u201ccan be eaten by bacteria, which causes all sorts of transformations in the environment,\u201d says Ward. \u201cFor example, on the seafloor, you have organic carbon that can transform into different greenhouse gases, like nitrous oxide and methane, depending on the conditions. If we\u2019re not monitoring for production of these other greenhouse gases, we can\u2019t tell you exactly how much carbon was truly sequestered.\u201d \n",
            "Running Tide, in fact, offers a cautionary tale about sinking macroalgae. In 2021, the company filed a patent for a floating apparatus seeded with kelp and \u201cenhanced with a nutrient payload\u201d of iron oxide to spur the growth of phytoplankton blooms, which can consume large amounts of atmospheric CO2. The plan raised enough concerns about unintended consequences that some of the company\u2019s scientists reportedly quit. In a 2022 article published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the University of Tasmania marine biochemist Phillip Boyd and coauthors modeled the potential impacts of apparatuses like that proposed by Running Tide, concluding that they would likely present a \u201crange of biological threats\u201d for offshore ecosystems, from altered water chemistry to the introduction of invasive microorganisms. Asked to respond to that criticism, Running Tide\u2019s Hr\u00f3bjartsson said in an email, \u201cWe would never, and never have, deployed anything into the ocean that isn\u2019t deemed at most a minor or transitory impact on the ocean environment by best available science.\u201d",

            "Ultimately, Boyd and his coauthors concluded that there was a great need for just the kind of research that the SEA-CO2 program will produce. \u201cMarine carbon removal is a very challenging field, because it\u2019s not just about the science,\u201d Boyd says. \u201cThere\u2019s the technology aspect, the economics, the communicating to the public, the regulatory frameworks, and then there\u2019s the markets. And, as far as I can see, none of those are really fit for purpose at the moment.\u201d",
            "BQSome scientists say CO2 removal is simply a distraction from the urgency of the climate crisis and an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels.",
            "Despite the fact that scientists are only just beginning to look into the effectiveness of mCDR, private carbon markets are flourishing, and private investors have been betting big on its success. Some of the largest names in tech have already pumped tens of millions of dollars into Ebb Carbon, Running Tide, and others.\n",
            "Of course, recent years have shown the grave danger of Silicon Valley\u2019s favorite mantra, \u201cmove fast and break things.\u201d When it comes to the environment, moving fast may be critical, but breaking things can be catastrophic. Some scientists have made the point that carbon dioxide removal \u2014 and the sale of those carbon credits \u2014 is simply a distraction from the urgency of the climate crisis and an excuse to continue burning fossil fuels. Friederike Otto, a lead author of the latest IPCC report, recently told The Guardian that the tools to keep warming to 1.5 degrees are already available and completely understood: stop extracting fossil fuels, scale back industrial farming and deforestation, the list goes on. \u201cWe should act as if CDR will never be achievable,\u201d Otto said. \u201cWe do not have a technology at the moment that works at scale\u2026 so we should make our policies as if CDR is not an option.\u201d",
            "Boyd agrees that a CDR technology that is safe, effective at storing carbon for long durations, verifiable, and scalable does not yet exist. But we need the acceleration that private business and carbon markets can bring, he says. \u201cIf we are going to build this partnership with businesses, [which] have the tools and the wherewithal and the infrastructure to really drive this, then there has to be a more substantive conversation around what the speed bumps are,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we want to hold [companies] back, but at the same time, the ocean is a complex place.\u201d",

            "*The_South_Belridge_Oil_Field_in_Kern_County,_California",
            "Down on the south end of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, oil rigs have plumbed the earth like flocks of blackened drinking birds for more than a century. Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

            "Researchers at NREL had been thinking about something like GeoTES for years, but they needed funding and land to make it a reality, which led them to partner with a Kern County-based energy investment firm, Premier Resource Management, in Bakersfield. In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea. By early this year, when California officially announced a ban on new permits for hydraulic fracking, they were fully focused on a way to give the old wells new life \u2014 as a battery, of sorts.\n",
            "BQTo survive a downturn in oil and gas, Kern County aims to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub.",
            "In its heyday in the mid-1980s, Kern County produced 256 million barrels of oil a year, and it remains the seventh-largest oil producing county in the U.S. Despite the industry\u2019s harm \u2014 more people per capita die from chronic lower respiratory disease here than anywhere else in California \u2014 drilling still pumps $13 billion a year into the local economy. Eight of the county\u2019s top 10 taxpayers are energy companies. Bakersfield High School\u2019s mascot is an oil driller. Oil and gas jobs pay an average of about $100,000 a year, which is significant in the farming-heavy San Joaquin Valley, where 20 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.",
            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",
            "State leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, have said the transition toward a greener economy should be \u201cjust,\u201d meaning, in part, that communities dependent on the oil and gas industry would see alternative sources of income, and workers would be trained for good-paying jobs in renewable industries. In surveys, though, workers across the nation note that the cost and availability of training for wind and solar work remains a barrier to entry and that oilfield jobs still pay better than positions in renewable energy.\n",

            "The geothermal industry would appear to offer a relatively seamless shift for many oilfield workers. Often, contractors can simply apply their skills to hot water instead of oil. As envisioned, GeoTES will use the fossil fuel industry\u2019s drilling data and some of its existing infrastructure, but it will also enlist skilled labor to bore and manage new holes. When Umbro pitches the project to funders and investors, he touts it as a perfect opportunity to transition workers into a decarbonized economy.",
            "GeoTES remains geographically limited and unproven in the field, but the challenge it seeks to solve is widespread and well understood. \u201cIf we aim for a deeply decarbonized electricity system with a very high share of renewables, long-duration storage will definitely be a problem,\u201d Gillingham said.\n",
            "Gabe Murtaugh, director of markets and technology for the Long-Duration Energy Storage Council, a global nonprofit that works to accelerate deployment of long-duration energy storage, cautions that 10-hour energy-storage solutions will help us get through the swing from night to day, but that we produce and consume renewable energy on a scale that spans seasons.\n",
            "\u201cA 10-hour solution really wouldn\u2019t be enough to carry you through a two-week period in the winter with low solar and low wind output,\u201d Murtaugh said. To fully decarbonize, he and other experts say, we will need a way of holding onto energy for hundreds of hours.",
            "BQFor now, long-duration storage must compete against cheap natural gas and lithium battery technology. ",
            "The GeoTES demonstration in Kern County will store renewable energy produced on site, but similar technology could also store excess power from wind and solar farms or even nuclear power plants during times when they produce more electricity than the grid demands. These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

        "content": [
            "*The_Pinyon_Plain_uranium_mine,_which_recently_opened_in_Arizona",
            "After sitting dormant since the 1980s, the Pinyon Plain uranium mine began operating in January on the Kaibab National Forest in Arizona, about seven miles south of the Grand Canyon. Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",
            "BQThe world will need up to 100,000 tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean doubling mining.",
            "Another driver of the search for new sources of uranium, which is essential to nuclear reactors, is geopolitics. The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts. But based on the industry\u2019s track record of polluting air, water, and soil with both radioactivity and heavy metals, and its obfuscation of mining\u2019s environmental threats, many observers \u2014 especially Indigenous people, who have borne the brunt of past uranium mining and who still suffer health problems linked with unremediated mining sites \u2014 remain skeptical.\n",
            "Exploration continues nonetheless. \u201cEveryone is convinced there is going to be a much larger demand for uranium going forward,\u201d said Matthew L. Wald, an energy analyst for the American Nuclear Society, a nonprofit organization that promotes nuclear power, and the Breakthrough Institute. \u201cThe domestic uranium mining industry is being brought back to life.\u201d",

            "fCUranium found near Sulfur Springs Draw in Texas.\nU.S. Geological Survey",
            "\u201cThe utilities that serve most of the electric load in most of the U.S. are promising to reduce their carbon to near zero by 2050,\u201d said Wald. Solar and wind will provide some of the needed power, but as the need for electricity soars, especially to charge electric vehicles, he said, \u201cthey are looking extremely eagerly at advanced reactors.\u201d",
            "If small modular reactors \u2014 units that can produce up to 300 megawatts of energy \u2014 prove efficient and economical, Wald says, they could be mass produced quickly and further increase the demand for uranium. There are plans for several small modular reactors, which have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, currently underway in the U.S. and Canada. \n",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world will need up to 100,000 metric tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean nearly doubling mining from current levels. And so companies around the globe are both looking for new deposits and reopening old mines. In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",
            "BQSupporters of uranium mining say new methods are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past.",
            "Greenland, meanwhile, is going against this trend. Concerned with the possible health impacts of mining, the Indigenous Inuit government in 2021 banned prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of uranium. And in 2023 it denied a permit for an Australian company to mine a massive deposit of rare earth metals called Kvanefjeld because bringing them to the surface would also convey uranium, with which it is commingled. ",
            "What will this new era of uranium mining mean for the environment? Historically, the industry has polluted groundwater, surface water, and soil around the world with radioactive waste and dust, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage. In some places, damage has been remediated by industry and government. But in many cases, due to cost or the difficulty of remediation, the pollution still contaminates the environment.",
            "But supporters of uranium mining say that new methods and technologies are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past and have far smaller footprints. That\u2019s because most new mines now use in-situ leaching, in which ore is left in the ground and miners recover the earth\u2019s minerals by dissolving them with hydrogen peroxide or an acid or alkaline leach. The \u201cpregnant\u201d solution is then pumped to the surface, where uranium is extracted in a recovery plant.",
            "iFhttps://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/17156172/embed",
            "In-situ mining \u2014 which requires a series of wells but no open pit \u2014 causes far less surface disturbance than open-pit mining, uses less water, and leaves behind no contaminated tailings or waste rock. Fifty-seven percent of the world\u2019s total uranium was produced using in-situ leaching in 2019, up from 16 percent in 2000, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group.",
            "\u201cWhen [the U.S.] led the world in production in 1980, much of our production was conventional open pit and underground,\u201d said Scott Melbye, president of Uranium Producers of America and CEO of Uranium Royalty, which provides capital for mines. \u201cEighty to 90 percent of production going forward [will be] coming from in-situ recovery.\u201d",
            "Mines in the U.S., he said, are held to extremely high standards compared with mines in some other countries, and nuclear energy is going to play a much larger role in the future of energy. \u201cIf we cross our arms and say we don\u2019t want any mining in the United States, that just means you are willing to take stuff from Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan, and the Congo, where there is child labor and no attention paid to air quality or water quality or all those things.\u201d",
            "BQThe controversial Pinyon Plain mine sits beneath Red Butte, on land that many tribes say is sacred.",
            "In-situ mining, however, is not without risks, which include the contamination of groundwater with radon, heavy metals, and leaching fluids. The Obama administration proposed tighter standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by in-situ uranium mining, with a focus on groundwater protection and restoration, but the Trump administration rolled those regulations back. According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this. It sounds straightforward, and it is.\u201d ",
            "Those most skeptical of the new era of uranium mining are people who live near old mining sites across the American West, where the scramble to find uranium to build the first atomic bombs during the Cold War left open pits and radioactive waste piles and dust scattered across the landscape. A disproportionate number of these sites are on or near Indigenous land.\n",

            "That\u2019s one reason Pinyon Plain, in Arizona, has raised hackles. The mine sits beneath Red Butte, on land that many tribes, including the Hopi and the Havasupai, say is sacred.",
            "In 2016, the mine\u2019s owner, Energy Fuels Resources, was pushing forward with construction when it ruptured a perched aquifer \u2014 a confined pool of water sitting above the local water table. The company pumped this excess water into an open-air holding pond. But the pond wasn\u2019t big enough, so the company used water cannons to spray the overflow, which was tainted with arsenic and uranium at levels well above federal standards, into the sky to enhance the evaporation rate.\n",
            "Because it is in a sensitive natural and cultural area, the Pinyon Plain mine has raised objections from a long list of tribal officials and environmentalists. As Energy Fuels Resources pushes forward with mining, experts fear it could leak radioactivity into nearby groundwater that serves the Havasupai Tribe and flows into the waters of the Grand Canyon.\n",
            "\u201cThe aquifer feeds the Grand Canyon springs,\u201d said Taylor McKinnon, Southwest director of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cThey are incredibly important biologically and important to the Havasupai, whose name, People of the Blue-Green Water, ties to one of those springs.\u201d\n",
            "BQThere are hundreds of abandoned uranium mines in the Four Corners region that have yet to be cleaned up.",
            "Then there is the issue of mining waste that has been left in place for decades. \u201cDepending on whose numbers you use, there are 500 or a thousand or more uranium mines in the Four Corners region, many of them on the Navajo Nation, that are abandoned and have yet to be reclaimed or cleaned up,\u201d said McKinnon. He has worked on uranium issues in the Southwest since 2007 and is battling the Pinyon Plain mine because of its potential to contaminate groundwater. Many of those sites \u201ccontinue to pollute,\u201d McKinnon adds. \u201cAs you can imagine, that rightfully casts doubt on regulators and industry\u2019s claims that it\u2019s going to be done right this time.\u201d",
            "The largest accidental release of radioactive water in the U.S. occurred in 1979, when the tailings disposal pond at New Mexico\u2019s Church Rock mine, owned by the United Nuclear Corporation, breached its dam and sent 94 million gallons of radioactive waste into the Rio Puerco. The water flowed onto the Navajo Nation, where radioactive pollution remains in waterways and in soil where livestock graze. Every year, the community commemorates the spill by walking to the site of the dam breach and offering healing prayers.\n",
            "Studies have found that proximity to uranium mines increases the likelihood of illness, including kidney disease, hypertension, and other chronic diseases; a 2019 study revealed elevated autoimmunity in people living near abandoned mine sites on the Navajo Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the risk of radiation,\u201d says Eric Jantz, an attorney at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. \u201cBut also the chemical properties of mine waste\u201d\u2014 including arsenic and other heavy metals \u2014 \u201cthat are really problematic from a public health standpoint.\u201d\n",

            "The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, part of the Organization of American States, held a hearing in February on the subject of uranium mining on Indigenous lands. Tribal leaders pointed out that much of the uranium mining was, in the U.S., carried out without the permission of Indigenous residents, and waste was often left behind. In the U.S., federal agencies often ignored or suppressed the dangers of uranium mining.",
            "Jantz and tribal leaders are advocating for a moratorium \u201con all new uranium mining and milling on Indigenous lands or near culturally important sites until [the government] has remediated all legacy waste and implemented laws governing uranium development consistent with its human rights obligation.\u201d",
            "As the world electrifies to combat climate change, nuclear power is likely to become a growing part of the energy mix. \u201cI\u2019m all for responsible mining,\u201d said David Kreamer, a professor of hydrology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has studied the Pinyon Plain mine. Uranium mining \u201ccan be done safely and be protective of the environment, but in many cases it\u2019s not. It comes down to planning, regulation, and monitoring.\u201d"

            "Last November, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and U.S. climate envoy John Kerry shook hands on a pledge to triple renewable energy globally by 2030. It was hailed as a welcome revival of climate cooperation between the world\u2019s biggest and second-biggest emitters of greenhouse gases and offered hope that the two veteran climate negotiators had found a way through a blizzard of negative diplomatic exchanges to keep alive the prospects for greater global ambition on tackling climate change. ",
            "In one key sector essential to that ambition, however, the Chinese government can argue, with some justification, that it is China, not the United States, that is in the lead. In a world in which national climate targets are being missed, the speed and scale of expansion in China\u2019s installed renewable capacity is unmatched. ",
            "In 2020, for example, China pledged to reach 1,200 gigawatts of renewables capacity by 2030, more than double its capacity at that time. At its present pace, it will meet that target by 2025, and could boast as much as 1,000 gigawatts of solar power alone by the end of 2026, an achievement that would make a substantial contribution to the 11,000 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity that the world needs to meet the 2030 targets of the Paris Agreement. Fossil fuels now make up less than half of China\u2019s total installed generation capacity, a dramatic reduction from a decade ago when fossil fuels accounted for two-thirds of its power capacity. \n",
            "BQIn 2022, China installed roughly as much solar capacity as the rest of the world combined, then doubled additional solar in 2023.",
            "When the International Energy Authority issued its assessment of the pledge to triple renewables globally by 2030, it pointed out that the 50 percent increase in global renewable installations in 2023 was largely driven by China. In 2022, China installed roughly as much solar photovoltaic capacity as the rest of the world combined, then went on in 2023 to double new solar installations, increase new wind capacity by 66 percent, and almost quadruple additions of energy storage.",
            "For the past two decades, China has been notorious as the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, a country that also uses as much heavily polluting coal as the rest of the world combined. How did it also become the world\u2019s renewable powerhouse? ",
            "Part of the answer goes back to investment decisions made in the mid-2000s when China\u2019s decades-long phase of rapid GDP growth was coming to an end. Labor costs were rising, and China\u2019s development model, with its overwhelming dependence on coal, had plunged China into multiple crises of air, soil, and water pollution. In the first decade of this century, China\u2019s emissions more than doubled, and by 2006 it had overtaken the U.S. to earn the unwelcome title of the world\u2019s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases by volume.\n",

            "China\u2019s leadership was alert to the negative diplomatic impacts of being the world\u2019s worst polluter, especially in those countries most vulnerable to climate impacts. At the same time, China\u2019s own exposure to climate change effects, on top of its escalating pollution crisis and the public unrest it was generating, was becoming a significant topic in Beijing\u2019s top-level policy discussions. China\u2019s planners were looking for investments that would create an opportunity for a more advanced technological future, and this coincided with the need to clean up China\u2019s environment and the global effort to cut emissions. All this pointed to supporting the development of the renewable technologies the world would need if it was to avoid climate catastrophe. ",
            "In the next and every subsequent five-year plan, China made strategic investments in all aspects of renewable technologies, from solar and wind capacity, green hydrogen, and geothermal projects to research and investment in battery storage and its supply chains. In the first phase of its rapid industrial development starting in the 1990s, China had been obliged to license technologies owned by others. Now the strategic ambition was to dominate the field, positioning China as the global supplier of goods to an increasingly carbon-constrained world. \n",
            "BQIf China has been clear about the opportunity side of climate change, it has been less enthusiastic about cutting its own emissions.",
            "Within a decade, China had largely achieved its goal of dominating not only the production of solar and wind technologies, but it had developed a near monopoly on every aspect of the supply chains, including the mining and processing of the rare-earths and strategic minerals essential for the clean energy revolution. Today, China has more than 80 percent of the world\u2019s solar manufacturing capacity. The extraordinary scale of China\u2019s renewables sector output has driven down prices worldwide, and this is a key factor in reducing the cost barrier to renewable systems for poorer countries. Today China not only holds important positions in wind and battery technologies, but a Chinese company, BYD, has become the world\u2019s biggest EV manufacturer, and China is poised to pose a formidable global challenge in all aspects of electric transportation to established vehicle brands.",
            "But if China has been clear about the opportunity side of climate change, it has been less enthusiastic about cutting its own emissions: In the first two decades of the century, the economy remained overwhelmingly dependent on coal, and China argued that committing to major cuts in emissions would be an unfair constraint on its right to develop. That began to change with President Xi Jinping\u2019s surprise announcement at the 2020 U.N. General Assembly that China would peak its emissions \u201cwell before\u201d 2030, as it had promised in Paris in 2015, and in an important new offer, that it would aim for carbon neutrality by 2060. A radical renewables program would be essential to meeting those goals.\n",

            "Xi Jinping\u2019s announcement attracted global attention, but its most galvanizing effect was at home. It sent a powerful political signal in favor of renewable investments across China, and the nation\u2019s giant state-owned enterprises, including its traditional energy companies, were compelled to take notice, both of Xi\u2019s unequivocal message and the policy initiatives it triggered. The National Energy Administration (NEA), the body that regulates China\u2019s energy sector, also recognized that new policies and mechanisms would be needed if China was to implement Xi\u2019s targets. ",
            "Massive wind farms were already operating in northern China, and now a series of utility-scale clean energy bases involving many of China\u2019s massive state-owned utility companies were planned for the relatively empty western desert regions. These bases, a combination of vast solar arrays and wind farms, are to be connected to markets in eastern China through high-speed transmission lines. The projects take advantage both of high solar radiation in the desert and large amounts of cheap, available land. China aims to build more than 200 such bases to help to raise its renewables capacity to about 3.9 terawatts by 2030, more than three times its 2022 total.",
            "BQChina still generates about 70 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels, as renewable energy use lags behind installed capacity.",
            "In addition to these desert projects, the NEA promised in 2021 to improve rural grid transmission and allow village collectives to invest in distributed renewable power and share the benefits. To promote the adoption of distributed rooftop solar, the NEA launched the Whole County PV program, a national pilot scheme that aimed to install photovoltaics in roughly half of China\u2019s county-level rural administrations, comprising about a quarter of China\u2019s population. The program set targets of providing solar to 20 percent of residential properties, with separate targets for commercial buildings.",
            "The utility-scale developments had left out China\u2019s more scattered rural populations, so showing interest in a rural model in which customers both draw energy down and sell energy back to the grid was a radical departure for China\u2019s traditional central planners and grid operators. The NEA now aimed to include China\u2019s neglected rural population in the renewable revolution. By the end of 2022, 676 counties had signed up for the scheme, and more than 51 gigawatts of new distributed solar photovoltaic was installed, nearly half of it on from rural rooftops. In total, by the end of 2022, China had built roughly 157 gigawatts of distributed photovoltaic capacity, more than double that of the U.S.",

            "Today the renewables sector is one of the relatively few bright spots in the Chinese economy, having benefited from a surge in government stimulus as Beijing tried to restore growth hit hard by Covid-19. The massive real estate market, which boosted China\u2019s GDP figures for more than three decades, is teetering on the edge of collapse. The pandemic and the downturn in global economies that followed has hit China\u2019s exports, and nervous Chinese consumers are sitting on their wallets in case things get worse. Renewable energy, however, seems to have a bright future, but fully realizing that potential will demand further radical reforms.",
            "Renewables now account for half of China\u2019s installed capacity, but there has also been a surge in permits for new coal-fired power plants, and China still generates about 70 percent of its electricity from fossil fuels. This means actual renewable energy use is lagging behind installed capacity.",
            "BQThe government has announced plans to create a unified electricity system, merging regional grids into one national market.",
            "This is largely due to problems with China\u2019s giant grid, which prefers high-speed transmission from reliable sources to the challenge of integrating variable renewable power and the associated challenge of matching intermittent supply to demand. For the grid companies, China\u2019s coal-fired power plants are steady and predictable, and they are allowed many more hours of grid access than renewables. In addition, anxieties about energy security are now high on the policy agenda, reinforced by geopolitical tensions and recent droughts that affected hydropower output and resulted in power cuts. In China, energy security still means coal.",
            "China\u2019s current climate and energy ambitions are embedded in a series of policy statements, including its current five-year plan. Although China\u2019s political culture places a heavy premium on meeting its declared goals, a number of energy and climate commitments are currently off target, largely because of the energy sector\u2019s continuing dependence on coal.\n",
            "In 2021, in the Paris Agreement commitments that China submitted to the U.N., Beijing pledged to \u201cstrictly limit\u201d coal growth, strictly control new coal power, reduce energy and carbon intensity by 2025, increase the share of non-fossil energy sources to 20 percent by 2025 and to 25 percent by 2030, and to generate 50 percent of the increase in energy use from 2020 to 2025 from renewable sources. Far from limiting coal growth, however, according to analysis by Carbon Brief, a new coal rush is underway as operators seize what they see as possibly the last opportunity for new plants.",

            "fCAn EV battery factory in Nanjing.\nFeature China / Future Publishing via Getty Images",
            "The figures confirm the trend: The average growth rate of coal consumption increased eightfold in the last two years, from 0.5 percent per year between 2016 and 2020 to 3.8 percent per year between 2021 and 2023, and new coal power approvals quadrupled between 2022 and 2023 as compared with the five years before the government pledged its strict controls.",
            "This has contributed to a 12 percent rise in emissions in the energy sector between 2020 and 2023. To meet the government\u2019s 2025 carbon intensity targets, emissions would have to peak this year and decline by 4 to 6 percent by 2025. Some analysts consider these targets already out of reach, but if China is to stay on track with its long- and short-term goals, the government must honor its pledge to control new coal capacity and continue its rapid buildup of renewables.",
            "To use its renewables capacity efficiently however, China has recognized that power system reforms are long overdue. The National Development and Reform Commission recently announced plans to create a unified national power market by 2030, merging its six regional grids into one nationwide electricity market to better manage fluctuations in supply and demand. If that can be achieved, China could not only enhance its position as the global leader in installed capacity for renewable but might also make better use of the clean energy it produces."

            "The Fish and Wildlife Service adopted its plan based largely on a study of \u201cinvader removal,\u201d published in 2021, in which researchers set up five pairs of test plots. On one plot, they left barred owls and spotted owls to their own devices. On the other plot, they shot any barred owls that entered.",

            "The researchers eliminated 2,485 barred owls over several years in the managed plots. Where barred owls and spotted owls were left alone, the population of the threatened species declined around 12 percent each year. Where barred owls were killed, the population of spotted owls stabilized.",
            "\u201cThe use of long-term field experiments to test the effectiveness of removals in benefitting impacted native species is rare,\u201d said David Wiens, a U.S. Geological Survey biologist and the lead author of the paper. \u201cThis study is the largest field experiment ever conducted on the demographic consequences of invasive competition between predatory birds.\u201d",
            "Steep population declines of northern spotted owls, which live only in old-growth and mature second-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest, raised alarms more than 35 years ago. Continued logging of those forests, experts said at the time, would drive the bird to extinction. In June 1990, the bird was listed as a threatened species in the Pacific Northwest and logging in its habitat was restricted.\n",
            "The federal action created a storm of controversy, but it prevented the extinction of the spotted owl. Efforts to prevent the disappearance of the owl, then and now, are not just about protecting a charismatic predator. Spotted owls are an indicator species for the health of the old-growth ecosystem: If a forest has adequate populations of flying squirrels, mice, and salamanders to sustain spotted owls, the forest is likely to be diverse and healthy. Spotted owls only live in mature forests, while barred owls can thrive in both young and old forests and eat a far wider range of prey.",

In a two-part paper, the former FWS biologist Kent Livezey concluded that the lack of trees on the Great Plains created a barrier to owl movement until settlers appeared. They excluded fire from ecosystems, which eventually allowed forests to spread, and they planted trees on farms and in towns, all of which provided an expansion of roosting habitat. Wheat and other grain farms may have increased the numbers of mice and other prey.",
            "Barred owls were first observed in Washington, Oregon, and California in the 1970s, and today there are more than 100,000 of them living in the northern spotted owl\u2019s territory in those states, according to federal biologists.",
            "When barred owls move into spotted owl habitat, the impact is rapid and thorough. The interlopers are larger and more aggressively territorial. They drive spotted owls away from their nests and outcompete the smaller birds for food. At least half the spotted owls in the forests of the West have been lost to barred owls, says the Fish and Wildlife Service, and some places have lost three-quarters of their historic population. When barred owls colonized Redwoods State and National Parks in Northern California, starting in 1987, the spotted owls all but disappeared.",

In areas where roughly 200 spotted owls lived in the early 2000s, only two or three birds remain, said Robin Bown, a FWS biologist in Oregon. The bird is currently listed as threatened. FWS scientists say it is warranted for listing as endangered, but the agency says such action is precluded because it must focus on higher priority species.\n",

Barred owls are just beginning their invasion of that bird\u2019s habitat, and the FWS strategy is to dispatch them as soon as they are detected. The Mexican spotted owl is listed as threatened in both the U.S. and Mexico but is not currently threatened by the barred owl.",
            "Though the plan to kill hundreds of thousands of owls is extreme, federal wildlife officials say other options simply aren\u2019t available.

In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature took the step of classing the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) as critically endangered. Around the same time, the European Union adopted a comprehensive eel regulation establishing measures to support the recovery of the stock, including through seasonal fishing closures and limits.",

The tiny, transparent, larvae are then carried on the current to Europe\u2019s Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs.

            "The eel\u2019s mysterious life cycle resists standard fisheries science. To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980.

Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle.

She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",

In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",

In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",

That downward trend is happening all over the world.\n",
            "e360: You excavate sea turtle eggs and rebury them. Why?",
            "Figgener: We do this because poachers would see the tracks in the sand of the nesting females and find the eggs if we left them where they were. Or in some cases the ocean would wash them away if they were buried too low down on the beach. So what we do is we put a little bag under the female while she is laying the eggs and we take the eggs to a more secure place to rebury them. We are careful to leave no track, so the poachers won\u2019t know where they are.",

            "For many people, such unique traits have made a Spanish company\u2019s more-than-four-year effort to raise octopods for food in factory-like conditions all the more horrific. In the farm planned for construction off Spain\u2019s Gran Canaria island, the animals would be kept in small, narrow cages stacked atop each other in a multistory industrial building. To kill the octopods, they would be placed in ice water at minus 3 degrees Celsius (27 degrees F). According to plans leaked to the BBC, the farm was designed to produce 3,000 metric tons of protein-rich meat from 1 million animals per year. ",

In Europe, they were mainly regarded as monsters, rumored to sink ships. In the 19th century, Victor Hugo wrote, \u201cIf there are no limits to the imagination when it comes to creating something hideous, the octopus can be considered a masterpiece.\u201d But the more people observed and learned about these creatures in aquariums, the more their disgust turned to sympathy, even affection.",

After an octopus in Germany, which had become famous by predicting the outcome of World Cup soccer matches, died, newspapers around the world eulogized him. And in 2020, the Netflix documentary My Octopus Teacher was watched by millions of viewers.",
            "Recent research has revealed that octopods can plan ahead, identify and remember humans individually, and solve complex tasks. Last year, scientists from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology showed that, just like humans, octopods have two very different sleep phases, one deep and one with increased bodily activity. Researchers even posit that they can dream. All of that is quite remarkable for a creature that lacks a spine and is more closely related to ants, slugs, and worms than to vertebrates. ",

Some have a huge range, like the common octopus, which can be found in the tropics, subtropics, and in temperate waters.

All octopods live for between one and three years, and after hatching their eggs, females die. Despite these characteristics, octopods show signs of intelligence usually attributed only to millions of years of intensively social lifestyles in mammals. Scientists are still struggling to understand how something so short-lived as octopods \u2014 which have no chance to learn from parents and peers \u2014 can perform its cognitive feats.",

In 2022, Rajewsky published a paper suggesting that the parallels between mammalian and octopod brains lie in their genetic programming \u2014 which is curious, because their last common ancestor, a primitive wormlike animal, lived more than 500 million years ago.

Between 350,000 and 500,000 tons of between 20 and 100 different species of octopods are caught each year for human consumption, up from about 100,000 tons in the early 1970s, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n",
            "Octopods are often taken as bycatch in industrial-scale fishing operations, but they are not discarded, due to their monetary value. In more artisanal fisheries, especially along coastlines in Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Portugal, they are the main target. Hunters go after the animals with traps that simulate safe hiding spaces. Spears are sometimes used in East Africa. In coastal communities, octopods can be an important source of protein and \u201ca crucial resource for the livelihoods of vulnerable people,\u201d according to Sustainable Fisheries, a U.S.-based NGO.",

For whales and for some fish species, monitoring efforts lead to strict annual quotas, which are at least partly enforced. But for octopods, the global industry is in many circumstances running blind: they are harvested without knowledge of their species or reproductive capacity, according to a comprehensive assessment by a team of scientists led by Warwick Sauer, from Rhodes University in South Africa.\n",
            "For example, a study revealed that in a large part of the Atlantic, annual catches of the common octopus might have been five times higher than official statistics indicate. \u201cGlobal catch data for octopuses should be considered a very rough estimate of total harvest, and likely to be a considerable underestimate,\u201d the FAO warns.",
            "Along coastlines, national or regional rules may limit how often artisanal octopus fishers can go out to sea or set a minimum catch size to protect potential offspring. \u201cBut rules are only as good as controls, and in many areas these don\u2019t exist,\u201d says Daniel Oesterwind, a marine biologist with the Th\u00fcnen Institute of Baltic Sea Fisheries in Rostock, Germany, and a member of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council.

This is a hazard for their survival, too: \u201cIf one generation of spawners is entirely removed, the stock will cease to exist.\u201d In some parts of the world, efforts are underway to stabilize populations.

            "In other countries, local communities are managing their own systems. In the shallow reefs around the Tanzanian island of Songosongo, for example, the common octopus and large blue octopus live in small caves. Villagers have long used spears to bring the animals ashore. However, as octopods have increasingly been traded and exported, overexploitation has become a big problem. To address this, communities have started to manage the fishery collaboratively.",

To stop the downward trend in stocks, villages chose a way that was as simple as it was effective: they began to close the reefs for three months every year. \u201cIt was part of the traditional knowledge that octopods always live in a home for three months, grow up, and then move on,\u201d says Medard. The periodic closures, which gives the animals time to reproduce and grow, proved worthwhile. The average octopus catch has increased measurably, and with it, local income.

            "There is a solar-powered revolution going on in the fields of India. By 2026, more than 3 million farmers will be raising irrigation water from beneath their fields using solar-powered pumps. With effectively free water available in almost unlimited quantities to grow their crops, their lives could be transformed. Until the water runs out. ",
            "The desert state of Rajasthan is the Indian pioneer and has more solar pumps than any other. Over the past decade, the government has given subsidized solar pumps to almost 100,000 farmers. Those pumps now water more than a million acres and have enabled agricultural water use to increase by more than a quarter. But as a result, water tables are falling rapidly. There is little rain to replace the water being pumped to the surface. In places, the underground rocks are now dry down to 400 feet below ground.\n",
            "That is the effective extraction limit of the pumps, many of which now lie abandoned. To keep up, in what amounts to a race to the bottom of the diminishing reserves, richer farmers have been buying more powerful solar pumps, leaving the others high and dry or forcing them to buy water from their rich neighbors.\n",
            "Water wipeout looms. And not just in Rajasthan.",
            "BQThe success of solar pumps is \u201cthreatening the viability of many aquifers already at risk of running dry,\u201d says a World Bank economist.",
            "Solar pumps are spreading rapidly among rural communities in many water-starved regions across India, Africa, and elsewhere. These devices can tap underground water all day long at no charge, without government scrutiny.",
            "For now, they can be great news for farmers, with the potential to transform agriculture and improve food security. The pumps can supply water throughout the daylight hours, extending their croplands into deserts, ending their reliance on unpredictable rains, and sometimes replacing existing costly-to-operate diesel or grid-powered pumps.",
            "But this solar-powered hydrological revolution is emptying already-stressed underground water reserves \u2014 also known as groundwaters or aquifers. The very success of solar pumps is \u201cthreatening the viability of many aquifers already at risk of running dry,\u201d Soumya Balasubramanya, an economist at the World Bank with extensive experience of water policy, warned in January.",

            "For much of the 20th century, artificial irrigation of farmland boomed thanks to state and World Bank investment in reservoirs and in networks of canals to bring water to fields. Irrigation watered the \u201cgreen revolution\u201d of new high-yielding but thirsty crops, keeping a fast-growing world population largely fed.",
            "But many systems have reached their limits. Rivers are being emptied, and new investment has dried up. So in the past three decades, hundreds of millions of farmers in hot arid regions, from Mexico to the Middle East and South Asia, have switched to getting their water from underground. ",
            "Boreholes sunk into porous water-holding rocks now provide 43 percent of the world\u2019s irrigation water, according to a study last year by the World Bank. Irrigation is responsible for around 70 percent of the global underground water withdrawals, which are estimated at more than 200 cubic miles per year. This exceeds recharge from rainfall by nearly 70 cubic miles per year. \n",
            "Monitoring of individual underground reserves is patchy at best. They are too often out of sight and out of mind. But a study of historical data from monitoring wells in 1,700 aquifers in 40 countries, published in January, reported that \u201crapid and accelerating\u201d declines in reserves were widespread.\n",
            "Scott Jasechko, a hydrologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, found water tables dropping by 3 feet or more every year in India, Iran, Afghanistan, Spain, Mexico, the United States, Chile, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. \n",
            "BQAid agencies and governments subsidize solar pumps to boost food production, reduce poverty, and cut fossil fuel emissions.",
            "The implications of this for the future are profound. \u201cGroundwater depletion is becoming a global threat to food security, yet \u2026 remains poorly quantified,\u201d says Meha Jain, who studies the sustainability of farming systems at the University of Michigan. But rather than calling a halt to groundwater withdrawals, policymakers are upping the ante by promoting solar power as a means of delivering yet more and cheaper underground water to fields. ",
            "The solar revolution on farms is happening with the best of intentions and is using a technology widely seen as environmentally beneficial. Farmers love the fact that their photovoltaic (PV) pumps do not require expensive and polluting diesel fuel or grid connections. Once installed, they can run all day at no cost, growing more food crops, or allowing their owners to expand their businesses \u2014 growing water-intensive cash crops, or earning income from selling spare water to neighbors. Many farmers also keep their old diesel or electric pumps to continuing pumping when the sun goes down.\n",
            "Development agencies and governments are equally keen. They subsidize solar pumps to boost food production, reduce poverty, cut emissions from fossil fuels, and curtail growing demands on overstretched electricity grids. But the long-term downside of this solar revolution looms large. \n",

The world\u2019s most populous nation \u201cstands at the threshold of a revolution in adoption of solar irrigation pumps,\u201d says Tushaar Shah, a water economist for the International Water Management Institute. The government intends to raise the number of solar pumps more than tenfold to 3.5 million by 2026. ",
            "The country is already the world\u2019s largest consumer of groundwater, with farmers each year pumping onto their fields an estimated 50 cubic miles more water than the monsoon rains replace. Unchecked, says Shah, solar power is set to make the situation worse.\n",
            "Sub-Saharan Africa could soon be on the same path. Shallow groundwater is present below fields in many places across the continent. But the cost of buying diesel fuel is prohibitively high for many farmers, and most rural areas are not connected to electricity grids. So, the arrival of stand-alone PV pumps is \u201ca game-changer for small-scale farms\u201d in sub-Saharan Africa, says Giacomo Falchetta, an energy and environment economist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria. ",
            " There are already half a million PV irrigation pumps watering fields across the sub-Saharan region. But Falchetta calculates that in the future 11 million more could be deployed to irrigate 135 million acres of currently rainfed fields \u2014 an area the size of France. These pumps could supply a third of the unmet water needs of small farmers, who produce most of the food across sub-Saharan Africa.",

            "The main thing preventing farmers from accessing the free water beneath their feet is the capital cost of the equipment, which typically represents up to a year\u2019s farm income. But that may soon change, as costs come down.",
            "\u201cThe potential in Africa is large,\u201d says Claudia Ringler, a water specialist at the Washington, D.C.-based International Food Policy Research Institute. \u201cSolar power is a breakthrough technology. Barriers will be increasingly overcome, and it will transform agricultural irrigation.\u201d",
            "Falchetta reckons horticultural crops will benefit most from the extra water made available by solar pumps, \u201cdue to their high water requirement and high economic value.\u201d But that rings alarm bells. Even modest falls in water tables in the continent\u2019s many shallow aquifers could dry up wells that sustain many of the 255 million people living in poverty above them, warns the World Bank.\n",
            "Such declines could also wreck fluvial ecosystems sustained by shallow underground water, including the wetlands and rivers on which millions of Africans depend for fish and other resources.\n",
            "Overexploitation of groundwater, the World Bank review concludes, is \u201ca classic tragedy of the commons \u2014 with exponential impacts disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable.\u201d Yet the bank, along with its sister agency the Africa Development Bank, is funding stand-alone solar pump projects in Togo, Niger, and elsewhere across the continent.",

            "In many places, however, farmers may not be able to wait for subsidies or aid projects to embrace solar pumps. They have little choice if they want to grow crops as other means of pumping water to their fields falter.\n",
            "That is certainly the case in Yemen, on the south flank of the Arabian Peninsula, where the desert sands have a new look these days. Satellite images show around 100,000 solar panels glinting in the sun, surrounded by green fields. Hooked to water pumps, the panels provide free energy for farmers to pump out ancient underground water. They are irrigating crops of qat, a shrub whose narcotic leaves are the country\u2019s stimulant of choice, chewed through the day by millions of men.",
            "For these farmers, the solar irrigation revolution in Yemen is born of necessity. Most crops will only grow if irrigated, and the country\u2019s long civil war has crashed the country\u2019s electricity grid and made supplies of diesel fuel for pumps expensive and unreliable. So, they are turning en masse to solar power to keep the qat coming. ",
            "The panels have proved an instant hit, says Middle East development researcher Helen Lackner of SOAS University of London. Everybody wants one. But in the hydrological free-for-all, the region\u2019s underground water, a legacy of wetter times, is running out. \n",
            "The solar-powered farms are pumping so hard that they have triggered \u201ca significant drop in groundwater since 2018 \u2026 in spite of above average rainfall,\u201d according to an analysis by Leonie Nimmo, a researcher until recently at the U.K.-based Conflict and Environment Observatory. The spread of solar power in Yemen \u201chas become an essential and life-saving source of power,\u201d both to irrigate food crops and provide income from selling qat, he says, but it is also \u201crapidly exhausting the country\u2019s scarce groundwater reserves.\u201d",

In a report with Musaed Aklan, a water researcher at the Sana\u2019a Center for Strategic Studies, Lackner predicts a \u201ccomplete shift\u201d to solar by 2028. But the basin may be down to its last few years of extractable water. Farmers who once found water at depths of 100 feet or less are now pumping from 1,300 feet or more.",
            "Some 1,500 miles to the northeast, in in the desert province of Helmand in Afghanistan, more than 60,000 opium farmers have in the past few years given up on malfunctioning state irrigation canals and switched to tapping underground water using solar water pumps. As a consequence, water tables have been falling typically by 10 feet per year, according to David Mansfield, an expert on the country\u2019s opium industry from the London School of Economics.\n",
            "An abrupt ban on opium production imposed by Afghanistan\u2019s Taliban rulers in 2022 may offer a partial reprieve. But the wheat that the farmers are growing as a replacement is also a thirsty crop. So, water bankruptcy in Helmand may only be delayed.",

            "\nEven the potential climate benefits of solar pumping may prove illusory, says the World Bank\u2019s Balasubramanya. In theory, switching from diesel or electricity to PV pumping should eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. But in practice, farmers often use their solar pumps to supplement existing pumps, rather than replacing them. And, however it is pumped, the extra water available will also encourage farmers to adopt more intensive farming methods, using more fertilizer and machinery to grow thirstier cash crops, increasing the carbon footprint of the farm. ",
            "What is to be done? Groundwaters are notoriously hard to police. India\u2019s overpumping has been \u201ca colossal anarchy,\u201d says Shah. Some states have attempted to control non-solar pumps that run on grid electricity by restricting power supplies to farmers to a few hours every day. It had some effect, says Shah, who first proposed the idea. But many farmers responded by buying more powerful pumps.",
            "BQWhatever the technology, \u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\u201d",
            "Now, to combat the excesses of solar pumps, Gujarat state has been paying some farmers high prices to use their PV panels to send power to the grid, rather than pump water, making solar energy in effect a new cash crop.",
            "The pilot project was limited to just 4,300 wells, and again the benefit was \u201cmuted,\u201d says Shah. He believes a better designed scheme could work. But Balasubramanya, who until recently worked with Shah in India, is doubtful. She warns that it might simply encourage more farmers to invest in solar panels, which could end up increasing water pumping further. \n",
            "In any case, controls based around the electricity grid will not work in rural Africa, where there is rarely any grid for farmers to either tap into or supply.",
            "None of this should be seen as a condemnation of solar power, says Balasubramanya. \u201cThe fundamental problem is not the solar technology itself.\u201d Whatever the technology, \u201cif the cost of pumping is zero, then people will pump unless some restriction is put on them.\u201d",
            "But Balasubramanya says technology could come to the rescue. If PV pumps had to be sold with sensors that allowed monitoring of their output, then regulators could directly limit their use. Whether governments would do that in practice, given the conflicting priorities between immediate food production and longer-term management of water, is another matter."

In January 2022, Tropical Storm Ana killed 46 people, and more than 190,000 lost or fled their homes. Six weeks later, Cyclone Gombe killed seven people. As stormwaters spread human waste into lakes and wells, Malawi\u2019s ongoing cholera outbreak, the largest in the nation\u2019s history, worsened.",
            "Rural villages, including Mwenye, were vulnerable to disease and disruption long before Freddy hit. More than half the nation lives in poverty, and one-fifth live in extreme poverty, which forces people to make high-risk decisions. According to the WFP, approximately 73 percent of Malawians live in areas prone to climate-related disasters, including floods, drought, cyclones, and windstorms. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to afford a plot or rent a house, so poverty is leading people to settle in hazardous places,\u201d says Miriam Joshua, an associate professor of geography and earth sciences at Malawi University. \u201cThey are afraid of moving to [safer] areas where there may be no livelihood.\u201d For the same reason, early warning systems \u2014 which do not always reach the most rural areas \u2014 have had little impact.",
            "Sitting on the banks of a river that runs off the base of a mountain, Manja Village, in Machinga District, has always been flood prone. It\u2019s also a place where poverty, land degradation, and agricultural dependency have compounded residents\u2019 risk.",

            "The men in Manja cycle from the hillside with bags of charcoal tied to their bikes. Nearly every Malawian household relies on firewood and charcoal for cooking and heating, so selling charcoal is one of the few businesses that provide a guaranteed source of income.",
            "But this has led to massive deforestation: by 1992, Malawi had lost more than half its forests, and it now loses an additional 0.63 percent annually. As the land loses its capacity to absorb water and as soil erodes, vast areas have become increasingly vulnerable to floods and mudslides.\n",

            "Enrico Scoccimarro, a senior scientist at the Euro-Mediterranean Centre for Climate Change (CMCC), has warned that a warmer climate will cause tropical storms to become more severe as ocean temperatures rise. \u201cA higher availability of energy in the ocean leads to more intense storms,\u201d Scoccimarro told the CMCC\u2019s Foresight magazine. \u201cMoreover, if a storm happens to go back to the ocean, it has a higher probability to re-strengthen and hit land again, and this is just what happened with Freddy recently.\u201d",

            "Clearly, preserving and adapting Malawi\u2019s food systems must be a priority if the nation is to withstand the crippling impacts of climate change. This, at least, can be done at a lower cost.\n",
            "Currently, 85 percent of the population depends on rainfed agriculture, and so lives are intricately linked to seasonal rainfall that is becoming increasingly erratic. But some farmers are adapting.",

He now grows peas between rows of maize, which increases yields during periods of high rainfall and reduces soil nutrient loss. Instead of using chemical fertilizer, whose price soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Jumpha uses compost and manure, which improves water retention during the dry season. Though he still struggles with the impacts of flooding, Jumpha continues to make a living and even harvests throughout the dry season, when most smallholders cannot.",
            "Farming methods like these are accessible to millions of Malawians and would be advantageous even without climate change. But most people never learn about these techniques, or they resist change. Subsistence farmers can\u2019t be expected to break free from centuries of convention, experts say, without structural support like training, subsidies, and incentives.",
            "NGOs currently provide some of that training, and in June, Malawi secured $4.4 million in funding from the Global Environment Facility\u2019s TRANSFORM project. Supported by the United Nations Development Program, the five-year project aims to reduce exploitation of natural resources, restore forests, and facilitate the uptake of alternative livelihoods, like mushroom cultivation and beekeeping.",
            "Such strategies are promising, but they have yet to reach the most rural villages. Helping Malawi\u2019s most vulnerable communities \u2014 which include people like Ellen Sinoya, whose land may be unproductive for some time to come \u2014 will be crucial for those recovering from Cyclone Freddy, and from the inevitable disasters of the future."

These sites are disproportionally concentrated near low-income communities and communities of color, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and researchers predict that heavy rains and flooding due to climate change are likely to both spread and increase exposure to these contaminants.",
            "For more than 15 years, Danielle Stevenson, who holds a PhD in environmental toxicology from the University of California, Riverside, has been pioneering a nature-based technique for restoring contaminated land, using fungi and native plants to break down toxins like petroleum, plastics, and pesticides into less toxic chemicals.",

I mean, they\u2019ve found fungi growing in Chernobyl in a melted down nuclear reactor. I\u2019ve been on sites that look so desolate and bleak, where the air smells like diesel. It looks like nothing could possibly live there. But when we sample the soil, we always find life, and we especially find fungi that are really resilient and have found a way to live in those conditions and get some sort of food from the pollution. ",

            "Stevenson: They are their own kingdom of life. They are not bacteria, not a type of plant or animal. Some fungi form mushrooms [as their fruiting bodies], like the ones we like to eat. Other fungi do not form mushrooms but create these beautiful dynamic networks throughout forests and grasslands that connect to the roots of plants. Fungi are largely overlooked, but it is a really important kingdom without which we wouldn\u2019t have soil or the carbon cycle or so many other really important functions in our ecosystems.\n",
            "BQ\u201cIn three months we saw a more than 50 percent reduction in all pollutants. By 12 months, they were pretty much not detectable.\u201d",

            "Stevenson: Decomposer fungi can degrade petrochemicals the same way they would break down a dead tree. And in doing so, they reduce the toxicity of these petrochemicals and create soil that no longer has these contaminants or has much reduced concentrations of it. They can also eat plastic and other things made out of oil, like agrochemicals. ",

            "Stevenson: Unfortunately, most metals don\u2019t break down because they\u2019re not carbon-based. In nature, it\u2019s actually plants that pull metals out of soil. And so there are fungi, they\u2019re called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, that can help plants do that better. And so on Taylor Yard [the Los Angeles railyard] and other sites, I\u2019ve worked with a combination of decomposer fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and plants that we previously found to be able to pull metals like lead and arsenic out of the soil into their aboveground parts.

We had a very high success rate. In three months we saw a more than 50 percent reduction in all [petrochemical] pollutants. And then by the 12-month period, they were pretty much not detectable.",
            "e360: On these sites, you grew native plants that took up a fair amount of the lead and other metals that had contaminated the soil. But then the plants themselves become toxic, right? Do you just leave them there on site?\n",
            "Stevenson: No, you harvest them. You take a huge amount of biomass that contains these metals and either reduce it to a small amount of ash, through incineration, or sludge that contains concentrated metals, which can then be disposed of as hazardous waste or even reused. In some cases, you could extract the precious metals and use them in batteries and electronics.\n",

Furthermore, it doesn\u2019t solve the problem, it just moves it somewhere else, typically to another state with less restrictive dumping laws. It spreads a ton of toxic dust along its route, and [all that trucking] leads to emissions contributing to climate change.",

So I knew that all of those were things that the fungi could eat as well, and I basically layered them in with cardboard from the bike shop. Later, I added worms that would continue the process of breakdown by taking what was essentially a mycelium block that had grown on the rags and then turning that into soil.\n",

I realized that I lived in a community that was surrounded by billion-dollar industries that had very little resources for people who looked like me. I got on Facebook and asked, \u201cWho needs help?\u201d So many people needed food. They needed water. People were newly homeless.",

I get a few small grants from organizations, but a lot of the funding comes from crowdsourcing from across the U.S. I assist people with food, shelter, water, clothing, paying their utility bills, paying their rent. But then they come to our community outreach meetings, they protest. [In late June] I was able to organize over 200 people from Texas and Louisiana to march with over 1,000 people down Wall Street to tell banks to stop funding environmental racism in our communities. I can\u2019t talk to a person in my community about CP2 coming when they can\u2019t feed their families, when they can\u2019t pay their rent.

            "Ozane: I\u2019m originally from Mississippi. When we first came to Louisiana in 2003, I immediately knew that those industries were bad because we could see the fires and the smoke. The air smelled like rotten eggs one day and like Clorox the next. It made me sick. One of my sisters who worked at a petrochemical plant ended up being diagnosed with cancer at age 30. Her job was to watch the flare to see how big or small it would be, but she didn\u2019t know what was coming out of that thing.\n",
            "Three of my children have eczema, and two have asthma. My son was recently diagnosed with epilepsy. He started having seizures last year, at the age of 17. He had his first seizure while driving between two facilities that had flares going. Those flares are loud, they are bright, and those are seizure-triggering things. It was also a couple days after the explosion at [a local refinery]. I tried to get answers, but everybody I talked to said that the chemicals released from these facilities disappear out of your blood quickly.\n",

The state of Louisiana has said that even though cancer rates are going up, there is no way to say that they\u2019re going up because industry has grown. Louisiana is third in the nation for cancer rates. People hear about Cancer Alley, not understanding that the entire state of Louisiana is a cancer state. I live about three and a half hours from Cancer Alley, and my community is surrounded by more than a dozen petrochemical and gas facilities and three LNG facilities.\n",

And shipping it across the ocean means more tanker traffic and dredging, more pollution, more pollution of our seafood. It\u2019s all for export, while driving up our energy costs here.

The Vessel Project fought coal in Westlake, Louisiana, and right behind coal came LNG. And right behind LNG, now, you have [new] petrochemical plants.

On the national level, I\u2019m trying to go to states that have communities that look like mine to connect these issues so that people know these are not one-offs.

If you look back at our Climate Week post, you\u2019ll see my children on the frontlines holding banners. But the fact that they still get up every day smiling, laughing, knowing the fight ahead, it gives me hope.

            "What will it mean for policymaking on environmental and other issues, practically speaking, if the U.S. Supreme Court jettisons the Chevron doctrine?",
            "This question is on the minds of legal observers and environmental advocates as they wait for the justices to decide two consolidated cases in which the court has been asked to overrule the famous precedent that has stood for four decades. That ruling, in the 1984 case Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council, says that where Congress has not expressed itself clearly, leaving gaps or ambiguities in federal statutes, agencies should be allowed to adopt the interpretation they prefer, so long as that interpretation is reasonable. ",
            "The cases now before the Supreme Court \u2014 Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless Inc. v. Department of Commerce \u2014 were brought by commercial fishing groups challenging a National Marine Fisheries Service rule, and a decision is expected in the coming weeks. If the court decides to scrap the Chevron doctrine, it could have major implications for environmental policymaking and regulation on issues ranging from air pollution and climate change to clean water rules, public lands management, endangered species protection, and more.\n",
            "BQOverturning Chevron would reduce government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments. ",
            "There are two very different perspectives on the Chevron doctrine, which largely determine whether one thinks it ought to be overruled. Critics say that Chevron gives policymaking discretion to unaccountable agency bureaucrats, allows presidents to abuse their executive authority, and encourages members of Congress to shirk their legislative responsibilities. They charge that Chevron is \u201creliance-destroying\u201d because it allows policy \u201cflip-flops\u201d between administrations and that it cannot be squared with the landmark Marbury v. Madison decision, which ruled that courts \u201csay what the law is\u201d and established the principle of judicial review. If one believes that there is always a single best answer to how to interpret a given statutory provision, and that a skilled enough legal interpreter can always produce that best answer, then overturning Chevron has some intuitive appeal. Why ever defer to an agency when judges can just decide? ",
            "Supporters of Chevron contest each of these claims. Congress inevitably leaves certain interpretive question unresolved, they say, which means that some statutory provisions are capable of different understandings. And democratically elected presidents charged with executing the law are entitled to use this ambiguity to advance their policy preferences. (This is otherwise known as the \u201celections have consequences\u201d argument.) They would note that agencies are amply accountable to multiple overseers and restricted by many legal, political, and institutional constraints. And they would reject the idea that Chevron is somehow responsible for legislative shirking or gridlock and point to House and Senate rules that make passing legislation exceedingly difficult, along with hyper-partisanship. While accepting that judicial review is legitimate and necessary, they would also say that nothing in the Constitution requires courts to decide all legal questions with no deference to expert regulators.",

            "To the claim that there is one discernible \u201cbest\u201d answer to every hard question of statutory interpretation, they would say no, sometimes Congress has not been clear (whether because political compromise requires some degree of unclarity; or because Congress is not prescient; or intentionally wishes to leave agencies room to adapt to change; or because of the limits of language), and there is more than one arguably best answer. From this point of view, Chevron is a sensible default rule of decision. It keeps courts from substituting their judgments for an agency\u2019s \u2014 and that is how it should be, since the agency charged with day-to-day implementation will better know what is reasonable in the run-of-the-mill case. ",
            "I support the defense of Chevron, as my past writings have made clear. Overturning or enfeebling Chevron would have negative consequences. It would further concentrate power in the judiciary; reduce the government\u2019s ability to respond to new scientific findings and technological developments, as well as to social and economic change; sow disruption and disorder in the lower courts; and undermine the regulatory stability on which the normal course of business depends. For example, courts rather than agencies would decide what pollution standards are \u201crequisite to protect the public health\u201d and allow for an \u201cadequate margin of safety,\u201d as the Environmental Protection Agency is mandated to do; what it means for an upwind state to \u201ccontribute significantly\u201d to the failure of downwind states to meet national air quality standards under the Clean Air Act; and whether \u201charm\u201d to an endangered species is limited to direct applications of force or can include habitat destruction.",
            "BQIf Chevron is abandoned, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read a statute.",
            "First, overturning Chevron would shift substantial power to the judiciary to have the last word on many important questions of policy that arise under federal law. It is more democratic for interpretive decisions, which inevitably involve policy discretion, to be made by agencies \u2014 which are part of an executive branch headed by an elected president, and subject to ongoing oversight by Congress \u2014 rather than by unelected judges. Deciding what qualifies as the \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d or whether implementing an offshore drilling plan would \u201cprobably cause serious harm or damage\u2026 to the marine, coastal or human environment\u201d \u2014 as the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to do \u2014 depends on a combination of legal, factual, and policy determinations. Agencies have research- and information-gathering capacity, and relevant expertise in areas of regulatory complexity, that courts do not possess. They are also required to solicit, consider, and respond to comments on their regulatory proposals from industry and other stakeholders, including states. Companies and their trade associations can and do weigh in through this process to shape rules that affect them, and to require agencies to explain themselves.",

            "fCJustice Amy Coney Barrett has suggested overturning the Chevron doctrine could lead to a flood of litigation. \nTom Williams / CQ Roll Call via AP Images",
            "Some of the conservative justices have implied that overturning Chevron is necessary to protect congressional prerogatives and restore Congress to its rightful role in our separation of powers scheme. Yet Congress already has the means to constrain agency overreach and check the president\u2019s executive power. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress has required agencies to provide advance notice of their rules and can effectively cancel any rule before it takes legal effect through a fast-track, filibuster-proof process requiring only a majority vote. Congress can also make its wishes known in the annual appropriations process and can defund agency initiatives of which it disapproves. If anything, abandoning Chevron would make the presumed separation of powers imbalance worse, not better \u2014 Congress could still use vague language to avoid making hard policy choices, only now those policy choices would be made by courts.",
            "Second, without Chevron, it will be harder for agencies to adapt regulation to new circumstances, something we should want government to do. Under Chevron, agencies can consider the latest scientific advances and technology developments; re-examine costs and benefits; consult with stakeholders; and consider the president\u2019s policy preferences too, knowing that the next administration may adopt a different view \u2014 in which case the agency would then bear the burden of explaining to the public and the courts why that new understanding is also reasonable. But without Chevron, agencies will have to defend every interpretive choice as the single best way to read the statute, not only now but for all time, making it more difficult for a later administration to change its mind given new information or unforeseen conditions. Eliminating flexibility will not improve regulation. It will rigidify it and prevent the government from updating policy over time.",
            "BQAgency officials are more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges.",
            "Third, overturning Chevron is likely to inspire more litigation and instability in the lower courts. Releasing all federal judges from any obligation to defer to agencies will invite parties to challenge many more rules \u2014 not just the most significant ones \u2014 and relitigate thousands of interpretations that courts have already settled. Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised this concern at oral argument, when she suggested that a flood of litigation might ensue over long-standing interpretations, where courts already determined that Congress was not clear and deferred to agencies.",
            "Overturning Chevron will also undermine uniformity and consistency in the interpretation of federal law. Chevron is a familiar and useful tool for lower court judges \u2014 they understand and know how to use its framework. What might replace it? The most likely standard of review the Supreme Court would substitute is so-called Skidmore deference, which is the amount of deference an agency is due in the estimation of the reviewing court based on several considerations \u2014 a standard that provides lower courts little guidance and maximum flexibility. As Justice Elena Kagan said at oral argument, \u201cSkidmore has always meant nothing.\u201d Without Chevron, judges will wade into often unfamiliar and technically complex statutes armed with their dictionaries, textualist principles, and canons of construction. They may or may not give any respect to the agency\u2019s views. This situation cannot help but increase conflicts among the lower courts.",
            "*Haze_hangs_over_lower_Manhattan_last_July",
            "fCHaze hangs over lower Manhattan last July.\nGary Hershorn / Getty Images",
            "This prospect leads to a fourth and related point, which is that overturning Chevron is likely to be bad for business. Of course, many conservative opponents of regulation believe that Chevron enables more regulation on balance, so they would like to see it gone. But there is a decent possibility that the consequences for business will be, at best, mixed. A few high-profile politically controversial rules will always wind up in the Supreme Court. And for those, Chevron will hardly matter because the Court will simply decide, as it has shown a tendency to do. But overall, Chevron is a stabilizing force because of its effect on lower courts. Without Chevron\u2019s default presumption in favor of government, it will be more tempting for many would-be litigants \u2014 domestic and foreign companies, state attorneys general, public interest groups, other stakeholders \u2014 to challenge agency rules, even those that many, if not most, companies might be able to live with or which they might at least prefer to uncertainty. Unleashing a cacophony of inconsistent rulings on what various statutory provisions mean, issued by up to 850 federal judges with minimal expertise in technical areas undermines the stable conditions necessary for the private sector to thrive.",
            "The Supreme Court may not overturn Chevron after all, perhaps in part because of some of these considerations. It may limit its application to narrow circumstances or impose new threshold tests on when it can apply. But it is highly unlikely simply to reaffirm it, which would be the best outcome for democracy, good governance, and business. ",
            "At bottom, Chevron embodies an inclination \u2014 that federal agencies ought to be given the benefit of the doubt if they offer good reasons for interpreting a statute a particular way, when no one can say for sure what Congress would have wanted to do. That inclination depends on a belief that agency officials are both more expert in regulatory implementation and more politically accountable than are federal judges, so that in such instances, agencies ought to be trusted to make the call. Coming to that conclusion requires judges to at least consider that there may be limits to their prowess and to allow that when it comes to complex regulatory statutes, where legal meaning and policy discretion are often intertwined, agencies can be legitimate legal interpreters. That attitude represents a certain faith in the capacity and competence of government that it would be a terrible shame to lose."

            "For nearly a decade, Nonhle Mbuthuma has traveled with a bodyguard. The founder of the Amadiba Crisis Committee \u2014 a local group formed to fight a proposed titanium mine along South Africa\u2019s Wild Coast \u2014 Mbuthuma has long had the support of many in rural Pondoland\u2019s Xolobeni community. But opponents have demonized her as an arch enemy of all economic development, and some have been encouraged to believe that if Mbuthuma \u201cdisappeared,\u201d they would get rich. \n",
            "Eight years ago, Mbuthuma\u2019s activist colleague Sikhosiphi \u201cBazooka\u201d Rhadebe, who opposed the mine, was shot dead outside his home by two men dressed as police officers. (Neither assailant has been caught.) Mbuthuma was also a target that day. Amadiba succeeded in halting construction of the mine, and Mbuthuma, 46, has continued working to protect this highly biodiverse region and the traditional culture of the Mpondo people.\n",
            "This week, Mbuthuma, and her colleague Sinegugu Zukulu, won a Goldman Environmental Prize for their recent efforts to prevent Shell Oil from prospecting along the Wild Coast. As the activist headed to San Francisco to pick up her award, she spoke via Zoom with Yale Environment 360 about Pondoland, plans for its future development, and continuing threats to her life.",
            "BQ\u201cShell is a big company with a lot of money, but we said that they are not bigger than our livelihoods and culture.\u201d",
            "Yale Environment 360: Tell me about your struggle with Shell Oil.\n",
            "Nonhle Mbuthuma: When we heard in late 2021 that Shell wanted to do seismic blasting off the coast, it was like someone put a bomb to our chest. These waters are precious, with rich ocean currents and reefs feeding whale calving grounds and fisheries. That water is part of us. We have cooperatives that do environmental fishing, using rods rather than nets that wipe out everything. But the ocean is also a sacred place. According to our traditions, our ancestors reside in the ocean. We have a right under our country\u2019s constitution to practice our culture, and that requires protecting our waters. So we decided to fight in the courts.",
            "The government had already given Shell permission to start seismic blasting. Shell is a big company with a lot of money, but we said that they are not bigger than our livelihoods and culture. We mobilized our communities to collect information to explain why the ocean is so important to us. We were backed by protests all over the country.",
            "Even as the surveying began, the high court ruled in our favor. The judges said the permit to do the surveys had been granted unlawfully because the government had not considered the impact on our livelihoods and culture and because Shell did not consult the community, which is a requirement of our constitution. But Shell and the government have decided to appeal the judgment.\n",

            "e360: The coastal waters off Pondoland are a marine protected area. Does Shell want to do seismic surveys inside that area?",
            "Mbuthuma: Yes, they do. It is an important refuge for fish that are overharvested elsewhere. It was a shock to us that this fact was not deemed important by the regulators. It was clear that short-term economic priorities came first for the government. But we cannot compromise our long-term economy for short-term benefits like this.\n",
            "e360: Seven years ago, the big threat to Pondoland and the Wild Coast was an Australian company, Mineral Resource Commodities, which wanted to mine for ilmenite, the ore that contains titanium, in the sand dunes and grassy hillsides along the shore, close to your villages. What is happening with the mine?\n",
            "Mbuthuma: The Australians haven\u2019t gone away. They are biding their time, I think. In 2018, we won a legal judgment to prevent the mine\u2019s construction. The Department of Minerals and Energy said it was going to appeal, claiming the judgment meant there could be no mining anywhere in South Africa. But that is not true: The judgment stated very clearly that people must be consulted and give their full, free, prior, and informed consent. It doesn\u2019t say no mining, but it says there must be consent.\n",
            "BQ\u201cThere are a lot of threats: verbal threats, text message threats\u2026 I am still targeted and demonized the way Bazooka was.\u201d",
            "e360: Is there a date for the government\u2019s appeal?\n",
            "Mbuthuma: No. The department just [issued] a notice of appeal. It cannot be left hanging in the air forever. To start titanium mining along the coast, the company will need a proper road to transport the minerals. Right now, there is no coastal road. The existing highway goes far inland. But the government badly wants to build a coastal highway. It will go right through our villages. ",
            "e360: So far, you have managed to prevent that too, right?\n",
            "Mbuthuma: Yes. We don\u2019t oppose any road. But we are trying to negotiate with SANRAL [the government road-building agency] for an alternative route that will save our villages and be less damaging for biodiversity. \n",
            "SANRAL says it would take too long to change their preferred route, with environmental authorization taking five years. But the alternative route was surveyed before, as an option they then rejected. It need only take 90 days to get approval because the community will support it.",

            "e360: Why won\u2019t they go with that?",
            "Mbuthuma: Clearly, the route is about serving the mining interests and other big projects being planned for our coastal areas. SANRAL finds it difficult to argue against us, so instead they just block discussion. And sometimes worse.",
            "e360: You have been campaigning a long time. Do you still have a bodyguard?",
            "Mbuthuma: Yes, I have to. There are a lot of threats: verbal threats, text message threats. Last year, a whistleblower told us about a plan to assassinate me. And I am still targeted and demonized the way Bazooka was. For instance, March 21 is Human Rights Day in South Africa. We usually organize a rally here in Pondoland to celebrate our culture and rights. But this year some people tried to stop it. They rolled boulders onto the road to block people arriving. Men armed with bush knives guarded the boulders. It was clearly organized. Someone had supplied a lot of alcohol.",
            "The message was that I was to blame for everything, and if Nonhle can \u201cdisappear,\u201d then everything can be good in the community. Of course, when someone is \u201cdisappeared\u201d it means they are dead.",

            "e360: Does the government see you as an enemy of development?\n",
            "Mbuthuma: Yes, it does. But I am a friend of development \u2014 of the right sort. Development is about people. Without people, it is not development. So our opinion is important. Our people must decide their own future. If we are not involved, then that is not development.",

We had a meeting with the Eastern Cape\u2019s department of public works, which has big plans to \u201ctame the Wild Coast.\u201d We tell [the government] about the potatoes we grow, and the goats we farm, and the trees whose fruits we harvest. We tell them about our cultural traditions and about the biodiversity. This is a hotspot for nature. But they see hotels as more important than fields and nature. They say they want to build on the coast, and in the sea they want big tourist boats and not fish.",
            "e360: So what development do you want? Can you have tourism that doesn\u2019t damage the coast?\n",
            "Mbuthuma: Yes, we can find a way. We have a community-built lodge, the Mtentu Lodge, that won an ecotourism award. It attracts people from around the world. It creates jobs, and its profits are apportioned democratically to the community. Unfortunately, the lodge burned down last December, but it is being rebuilt by the community.",

            "Mbuthuma: The future, I hope, will see more protection. Not with people being pushed out, but through community protection. We want to see ecotourism supported, with more eco-friendly lodges in the villages, so visitors can live with our people and learn about their culture.\n",
            "We dream of seeing the Wild Coast as an agricultural hub, where we process crops that we produce, rather than just taking them to market. We want the fishing cooperatives to be supported so they can process the fish too.\n",
            "e360: The government is in the process of legalizing the growing and possession of cannabis. This has been an important crop in Pondoland for some time. So is this an economic opportunity?\n",
            "Mbuthuma: Cannabis, which we call dagga, is part of our agriculture. We grew a lot even before it was legalized. For us it is a medicine. People here have been arrested for many years trying to protect our dagga fields. Now, growing and processing it could be part of our future. But you need a license to cultivate it commercially. Getting a license is expensive and complicated, and right now only rich outsiders can benefit from this industry. ",
