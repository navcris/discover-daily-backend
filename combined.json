            "Chronohygiene refers to aligning a person\u2019s sleep schedule with the body\u2019s natural sleep \u201cclock.\u201d",
            "Our bodies have evolved to receive cues from the environment that tell us when to sleep and for how long. This internal \u201cclock\u201d follows a circadian rhythm. Sleep cues include light exposure, activity levels and temperature.",
            "But aspects of modern life can interfere with natural sleep cues. Artificial lights, for instance, can mimic sunlight. Such lights can throw off the body\u2019s internal sleep clock. An out-of-whack sleep schedule can lead to issues such as depression and heart problems.",
            "Chronohygiene is all about taking charge of your sleep schedule. This can help you work with your body\u2019s internal clock rather than against it.",
            "One way you can support your chronohygiene is to avoid using screens at night.",
            "Before artificial lights, people usually woke up with the sun and worked through the day. Come nightfall, people slept through the darkness. Our bodies evolved to respond to lower light levels by releasing chemicals like melatonin, which makes us feel sleepy.",
            "But the body doesn\u2019t ramp up melatonin production until the lights \u2014 especially blue light \u2014 dim. Blue light is a high-energy form of light. It comes from sources such as LED lights, computer screens and phones. So using that tech can make it hard to fall asleep.",
            "Avoiding blue light at night may seem easier said than done. You might be doing homework on a computer or scrolling through your phone. But most computers and phones have a nighttime mode. This mode subtly shifts screen colors from bright, cool light \u2014 with lots of blue \u2014 to warm, cozy shades as it gets later.",
            "Other small changes can also grant you control over your sleep. Avoiding late-night snacking helps many people. That\u2019s because food can serve as a wake-up cue.",
            "Taking care of your chronohygiene helps your body follow a consistent sleep-wake cycle. And that natural rhythm may help keep you happy and healthy.",

            "A polar bear in Norway picks at its prey. Gulls nearby and other animals will eat the leftovers. Polar bears typically leave about 30 percent of edible animal\u2019s remains.",
            "Polar bears are picky eaters. And that\u2019s great news for other hungry Arctic critters.",
            "In one year, a polar bear can leave roughly 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of scraps behind on which other animals can dine. Altogether, that comes to an estimated 7.6 million kilograms (8,375 U.S. tons) of bear leftovers, researchers now estimate.",
            "This leftover meat, called carrion, points to the crucial role these bears \u2014 top predators \u2014 play in feeding other species.",
            "The research also sounds a warning. As climate change warms the Arctic, polar bears are at risk. A decline in their numbers could greatly threaten other species that are part of the Arctic food web.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Polar bears eat mainly seals, especially ringed seals. Scientists have long known these bears mostly eat the blubber of their prey. These diners often leave much of the rest behind. Until now, scientists have overlooked the size of those leftovers and their importance, says Nicholas Pilfold, A large-carnivore biologist, Pilfold works at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in California. He has done research in the Arctic for 15 years.",
            "As part of a team, Pilfold pored over studies, observations and anecdotes about scavenging activity around carcasses. These data went back as far as the 1930s. The researchers also analyzed studies on how many calories seals can provide. Then they also looked at studies that had tallied how many seals a polar bear consumes each year.",
            "During its hunting season peak, they found, a bear kills roughly one seal every three to five days. That comes to some 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of prey each year. A bear eats about 70 percent of that mass. The remaining 30 percent is up for grabs.",
            "Today\u2019s Arctic hosts an estimated 26,000 polar bears. So all those leftovers add up to millions of kilograms \u2014 thousands of tons \u2014 of food for scavengers.",

            "fCArctic foxes are one species that benefit from carrion scraps left behind by polar bears.",
            "Those who benefit from the leftovers include Arctic foxes, gulls, ravens and other polar bears. Occasionally even snowy owls, wolves and grizzly bears will feast on the remains.",
            "Pilfold has seen that \u201cfoxes will follow in the tracks of where the polar bears have gone,\u201d waiting for the bears to abandon their meal. Birds also fly overhead, waiting their turn, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s just this cacophony of sound of gulls,\u201d he notes. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to get some of that seal.\u201d",
            "Other species couldn\u2019t access this type of food if the polar bears hadn\u2019t left it behind, says study coauthor Holly Gamblin. She is a wildlife biologist in Canada at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.",
            "The new findings don\u2019t surprise Jon Aars. A polar bear expert, he works at the Norwegian Polar Institute in Troms\u00f8. Bear leftovers are probably a \u201crather important\u201d food source for other species, he says \u2014 \u201cparticularly at a time of the year when alternative food is not so easy to get.\u201d",
            "Polar bears often swim to find seals at sea or on ice floes. As the Arctic has been warming, the ice has been melting, too. This gives bears fewer rest stops to catch their meals, dine and rest. Earlier work by Pilfold\u2019s team showed that the bears often have to swim exhaustingly long distances between meals. They tracked one female who swam 400 kilometers (249 miles) nonstop over a period of nine days.",
            "Such long treks are weakening bears and have led some to starve. This can reduce polar bear populations. If this happens, the carrion they provide will likely decrease as well, Pilfold now says.",
            "His team looked at two regions where polar bears have been declining. Here, they calculate, about 323,000 kilograms (710,000 pounds) of carrion are likely being lost each year. Melting ice might also make it harder for some scavengers to reach bear leftovers.",
            "It\u2019s hard to predict how reduced leftovers might affect other species, Aars says. But \u201cit will have [an] impact one way or another.\u201d And how big an impact, he says, will depend on the species and which \u201cpart of the Arctic we look at.\u201d"

They started by dropping that person\u2019s DNA \u2014 from one of their skin cells \u2014 into an empty donor egg. Then, the scientists had to get the modified egg to boot out half of its 46 bundles of DNA, or chromosomes. The egg did this in a process called meiosis (illustrated here). ",
            "Every human being starts with the fusion of two cells: an egg cell from one parent and a sperm cell from the other. But for a variety of reasons, two parents may not have both the egg and sperm needed to make a baby. That has led some scientists to wonder if they could make an egg or sperm cell with a parent\u2019s DNA from some other type of cell in their body. Now, a new study brings that one step closer to reality.",
            "In the experiment, researchers caused human skin cells to\u00a0produce egg cells. Some of those eggs were\u00a0able to give rise to early human embryos.",

Same-sex male couples may also be able to use the technique to have a child that\u2019s related to both of them, says Paula Amato. An expert in reproductive medicine, she works at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.",
            "The technique is not yet ready to help people have children. It\u2019s still \u201ctoo inefficient and high risk,\u201d says Katsuhiko Hayashi. A researcher at the University of Osaka in Japan, he did not take part in the new work. But his team has reprogrammed tail cells from two adult male mice into eggs and sperm. Those reprogrammed cells gave rise to healthy mice that had two fathers. And these pups grew up to have offspring of their own.",

Then, they replaced the donor egg\u2019s nucleus with a one from a skin cell. (In the future, such a skin cell would come from the intended parent for the egg.)",
            "But there was a problem.",
            "Nuclei from most cells in the body, including skin cells, contain 46 bundles of DNA called chromosomes. But an egg cell has only 23 chromosomes. Why? Because when an egg and sperm cell meet, they each bring 23 chromosomes of their own from the parent. When they fuse, this egg and sperm produce a new cell. Called a zygote, it now has all 46 chromosomes needed to build a new human.",
            "In short, the donated egg with the transplanted nucleus had twice as many chromosomes as an egg should have. To fix that, the researchers used a chemical called roscovitine. It coaxed the modified eggs to throw out some of their extra chromosomes when fertilized by sperm.",

            "\u201cThat\u2019s probably, we think, because they had an abnormal number of chromosomes,\u201d Amato says. The failed eggs kicked out half their chromosomes, on average. But not the right half.",
            "None of the embryos were allowed to grow for longer than about six days. Many stopped developing at earlier stages.",
            "No embryo ended up with the right sets of chromosomes. So none would have grown into a healthy human. For instance, one embryo had 48 chromosomes instead of 46. That embryo had all 23 chromosomes from the sperm. But it had 25 from the skin cell. Some of those chromosomes had two copies. Others were missing entirely.",
            "\u201cIt was not the outcome we wanted,\u201d Amato says. \u201cBut it was more proof-of-concept. \u2018Hey, we can kind of make this process happen now.\u2019\u201d",
            "The team is now working to craft eggs with the right sets of chromosomes. But Amato suspects it will be at least a decade before the technique could be tested in clinical trials. Even then, such trials would probably not take place in the United States, Amato notes. U.S. law forbids tweaking the DNA of human embryos.",
            "One drawback to the new technique: It requires donor egg cells, Hayashi notes. Reprogramming cells as his team has done does not need egg cells to make other egg cells. Still, he says, \u201cthis technology has made a significant breakthrough.\u201d And, he predicts, \u201cnew technologies will stem from this achievement.\u201d"

Solar wind refers to streams of charged particles flowing out from the sun. Cosmic rays can come from other stars and galaxies.

The inner belt typically exists about 6,000 to 12,000 kilometers (about 3,700 to 7,400 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface. But it can dip much closer. One such dip occurs over the Atlantic Ocean. Here, there is a weak spot in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Because of this weak spot, the inner belt dips to about 200 kilometers (about 120 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface.

With the game, Emery hopes to show how we can better understand and accommodate the needs of neurodivergent individuals. \u201cIt\u2019s designed to show that it\u2019s the world itself that causes the challenges that we face, rather than ourselves,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

These offer ways to interact with everyday experiences that are often misunderstood, she says. \u201cGames as a medium are a really powerful way to do that.\u201d In this interview, she shares her experiences and advice with Science News Explores.

            "During my final year of high school, I saw that you could study multimedia at university. This included courses on interactive media, film, TV and video games. It sounded great. But one of the career people at my school said that it might not be a great career for a girl. They recommended I consider something else. ",
            "At first, I believed them. Then I attended an open day at one of the universities I was considering. I sat in on a presentation about the multimedia program. The presenter was not only the head of the department but also a woman. As soon as I saw her, I realized I could study multimedia, too. That\u2019s what I ended up studying for my first undergrad degree. \u00a0",
            "After earning my undergrad degree in multimedia, I moved to a remote community belonging to the Anangu people in the Northern Territory to teach. Many of the kids I was teaching didn\u2019t want to come to school. They weren\u2019t engaging with the lessons but really loved video games. I thought about how to combine the two. \u00a0\u00a0The Nintendo Wii console and Wii Sports game came to mind. I drove two and a half hours to buy them from a secondhand store. That Monday, I fired up the game and covered up the scoring with a piece of paper. Instead of relying on the game\u2019s scoreboard, I had the students keep score on the whiteboard. After that, our attendance rate skyrocketed. \u00a0\u00a0I was inspired by seeing how video games could make kids invested in their learning. I ended up doing an honors degree looking into the connection between education and games. I co-designed a game with the community that combined First Nations knowledge and the Australian curriculum. I loved it so much that I enrolled in a Ph.D. program. That degree involved looking at how games can raise awareness of domestic violence.\u00a0",

            "When you look at who\u2019s playing games in Australia, it\u2019s evenly split between male and female. And then, of course, there are nonbinary people as well. But when you look at who\u2019s making games, that same split isn\u2019t reflected. In Australia, for example, a recent report showed that only 22 percent of game developers identify as female. That\u2019s a problem that we need to keep working on in the industry. The makeup of those making games should reflect the people who are playing them. That\u2019s so people see themselves reflected in those games.\u00a0",
            "I think AI is really powerful and can do some really cool stuff. It shines in helping us bring our ideas to life. But to be engaging, games should be about human stories. We all have such cool stories that live inside us. These include our past experiences and future dreams.\u00a0",
            "We can use AI to help us bring those out in our creative work. But when AI becomes the creator, those games start missing those human stories. Nobody will want to play games made by AI because they\u2019ll just be recreations of other games that already exist. I find that boring and not creative.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "AI can code like a boss. But it hasn\u2019t gone through the same things you have. It hasn\u2019t been to school or visited the places you have. It doesn\u2019t have the friends you have.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Making games requires a lot of repetition. You\u2019ll come up with a game idea and then try it out. That lets you find what isn\u2019t quite working.

            "With a simple swish-and-flick of his wand, Ron Weasley yanks a troll\u2019s club high above its head in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone. Through graceful martial arts moves, element benders in TV\u2019s Avatar series launch boulders and waves of water skyward. And a casual gesture is all Marvel hero Scarlet Witch needs to fling away her enemies.",
            "Fictional heroes require magic or superpowers to lift objects without touching them. In the real world, you need physics. Sound, magnets and electricity, it turns out, can all create upward forces strong enough to cancel out the downward pull of gravity.",
            "This ability to suspend objects in midair could transform lab experiments, transportation and more. Just don\u2019t expect any real levitation technique to toss boulders or bad guys through the sky. At least, not without some outrageous \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 upgrades.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "If you\u2019ve ever been to a concert where the music was so loud you felt it thumping in your chest, then you know firsthand how strong sound waves can be. Acoustic levitation devices use those vibrations to hold objects aloft.",
            "\u201cYou can think of it as a very complicated surround-sound system,\u201d says Luke Cox. An acoustic levitator may contain hundreds of little speakers. Those speakers typically blare noise at a frequency of 40 kilohertz. Humans can\u2019t hear these sounds. \u201cBut if you look at the sound-pressure levels, it\u2019s louder than a jet engine,\u201d notes Cox. A mechanical engineer, he leads the company Impulsonics in Bristol, England.",
            "Sound waves from an acoustic levitator create alternating spots in the air of high- and low-intensity noise. The force of sound pushes objects away from the loud areas. As a result, items placed in quiet areas will stay there, as if tucked into invisible pockets. Fine-tuning the noise blasted by each speaker can steer those pockets around.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/S8IiUkJslbU?feature=oembed",
            "This acoustic levitator uses sound waves to steer millimeter-sized objects through the air. It can juggle up to 25 objects at once. The device is shown in a computer simulation on the right. It uses two grids of ultrasonic speakers (rainbow-colored dots at top and bottom) to create a field of sound waves (reddish pattern in the middle). In this sound field, particles get trapped in fairly quiet regions (black) between very loud regions (white).",
            "Acoustic levitation can lift all types of materials, solid or liquid. But it can only support very small, lightweight things. Some of the heaviest stuff to ever surf sound waves were Styrofoam puffs (like those inside beanbag chairs).",
            "Taller and wider objects need longer, lower-frequency sound waves to cradle them. Say you wanted to levitate a person \u2014 even someone curled into a ball. Cox estimates that would take at least 275-hertz waves, which are 1.25 meters (some 4 feet) long. Bass guitars play notes about that low. But the music from a bass-guitar levitator would also have to be devastatingly loud to lift someone off their feet.\u00a0",
            "\u201cI\u2019m probably going to need quite a few power plants\u201d to run the device, Cox muses. \u201cBut maybe a big nuclear one could do it.\u201d",
            "On top of that, you\u2019d need to shield anyone you levitated from the heat generated by that amount of power. Otherwise, your gnarly, nuclear-powered bass solo might literally melt their face off.",
            "Magnets, meanwhile, already safely lift objects much bigger than people off the ground.",
            "Perhaps the most striking display of that brute strength is a maglev train. Magnets on its cars and tracks interact to create an upward force. It lets the train hover about 10 centimeters (4 inches) above the track. This allows the train to glide nearly friction-free and travel twice as fast as trains that roll on rails. \u00a0",
            "Magnetic levitation is not limited to magnetic metals, notes Eric Severson. He\u2019s a mechanical engineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Diamagnetic materials also can accomplish this feat. Around a strong magnet, these materials can become weakly magnetized and start to repel the magnet. This repulsive force, though feeble, can win a fight against gravity.",
            "Graphite, gold and many other substances are diamagnetic. Water, proteins and other molecules in living tissue are, too.",

            "In 1997, two scientists famously used that fact to levitate a frog. They placed the creature inside a magnet made from two nested coils of wire. The field created by the device was 16 teslas. That\u2019s about 10 times as strong as the magnets used to pick up cars in junkyards. And it was just enough to buoy the frog near the top of the inner coil of wire. That coil was 18 centimeters (7 inches) tall.",
            "\u201cYou could theoretically make a person float,\u201d Severson says. But you\u2019d need one heck of a magnet.\u00a0In 1998, one of the frog floaters estimated that\u00a0you\u2019d need a 40-tesla\u00a0field created by a magnet running on 1 gigawatt of power.\u00a0That\u2019s roughly\u00a0half the power produced by the Hoover Dam.\u00a0",
            "There\u2019s another catch with magnetism: its short range. You have to be close to a magnet to feel its effects. So making something soar through the sky would likely require some other tech.",
            "Ballooning spiders already have high-flying levitation figured out. A flock of these critters once impressed and perplexed Charles Darwin by alighting on his ship some 100 kilometers (60 miles) out to sea.",
            "\u201cThey spin out a very long thread of spider silk and then, in the process, charge themselves up electrically,\u201d explains Igor Bargatin. This happens thanks to triboelectricity. \u201cThey lift off in the Earth\u2019s electric field,\u201d Bargatin says. \u201cAfter that, they\u2019re just carried by the wind.\u201d Sometimes, airborne arachnids are swept kilometers (miles) into the atmosphere.",
            "Bargatin is a physicist and engineer at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. When he first heard about ballooning spiders, he wanted to build something that would mimic their wingless flight. But he realized this spidey levitation won\u2019t work for large objects.",
            "Imagine trying to float a human. \u201cThe charge that they would need to accumulate is so large that you would start creating basically lightning all around you,\u201d Bargatin says. That wouldn\u2019t just be dangerous. It also would keep you from ever building up enough charge to take off.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja4oMFOoK50?feature=oembed",
            "When you think of flying animals, spiders probably aren\u2019t the first ones that come to mind. Yet ballooning spiders harness the power of Earth\u2019s electric field to soar miles high through the sky. Here\u2019s how.",
            "All told, real-world levitation likely won\u2019t ever measure up to the superpowers seen on screen. Still, it needn\u2019t be flashy to be useful.",
            "Acoustic levitation could handle tiny electronic components or lab samples without touching them. That would cut the risk of contaminating them. Severson uses magnetic levitation to make parts of motors float. That way they can spin faster without wearing down.",
            "Scientists are still dreaming up new uses for levitation, too \u2014 ones that play to different techniques\u2019 natural strengths and won\u2019t risk frying anything during takeoff.",

A zoologist, he works at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.",
            "Large snakes also tend to be faster. Why? Like sprinters, they have more muscle.",
            "Previous studies that analyzed snake speed typically relied on a single camera or one with low resolution. Others focused on just a few snake species. The new study included 31 vipers. Also included were four non-vipers from the family that includes cobras and one venomous snake from the colubrid family, which includes mostly nonvenomous species (such as the common garter snake).",
            "Evans and his team used two high-speed cameras to track snakes housed at Venomworld. This facility in Paris, France, collects venom for medical and research uses. The researchers coaxed each snake to lunge at fake prey. It was made of a warm gel that mimics muscle tissue.",
            "fCA Chinese moccasin (Deinagkistrodon acutus) strikes at ballistics gel while cameras measure its position and speed. The snake\u2019s strike, here shown at 3 percent speed, has an average maximum velocity of 2.6 meters per second.",
            "The fastest vipers included the terciopelo, the horned pit viper and the blunt-nosed viper. These species had maximum speeds that exceeded 3.3 meters per second (10.8 feet per second).",
            "The rough-scaled death adder was the fastest non-viper tested. It can jab toward prey at 2.2 meters per second (7.2 feet per second). This is roughly the same strike speed as some vipers, including the eastern rock rattlesnake. The mangrove snake, the only venomous colubrid tested, was slightly slower. It struck at roughly 1.8 meters per second (5.9 feet per second).",
            "The cameras also captured differences in how snakes bite. Vipers deliver venom with smooth, fast strikes. Some of the other venomous snakes bit and squeezed their prey multiple times. Another used its fangs to slash large wounds in its victim.",
            "Because Venomworld houses mostly vipers, the new study focused on those snakes. But many snake species weren\u2019t tested. Hiding among them, Evans says, could be snakes that give might some quick vipers a run for the money.",

            "While watching the Olympic Winter Games, you might wonder why skis, which are featured in several events, are so long. The skis used at the Olympics are of top-notch quality. Researchers tinker with every detail, from the materials they are made of to the shape they are cut in. The equipment is tested carefully, as details like these can give an athlete the leading edge on the slope. But why would you put planks under your shoes in the first place? Do this activity to find out!",
            "Earth\u2019s gravity pulls us all the time. It makes us return to the ground when we jump, and it makes objects fall when we release them. But gravity even pulls us down when we are standing on a hard floor!",
            "You see this when you sit on a mattress: Your weight, or how much Earth pulls on you, pushes the mattress down. As a result, the mattress squeezes together where you sit. If you stand on the mattress, you should notice that it compresses more than if you lie down or sit on it. When you are standing, all your weight pushes the small area where your feet touch the mattress. If you sit or lie down, your weight is distributed over a much larger area, so for each square inch that your body is touching the mattress, there is a much smaller force, and the mattress does not become as compressed.",
            "Snowshoes use this concept to make you sink less into fresh, fluffy snow. Snowshoes create a larger contact area with the snow, so your weight pushes less on each square inch of it. The strength of each push per square inch of contact area is what scientists call pressure, and snowshoes reduce that pressure.",
            "A larger contact area with the snow or floor has more advantages. Gravity acts on us as if all our body\u2019s mass is pushed into one point, and gravity pulls on that point. This point is called the center of mass. If this point is located above the contact area we make with the floor, we will not fall over. The larger the contact area, the easier it is to keep our center of mass above it, and the more stable we will feel.",

            "EXTRA:\u00a0Give your action figure ice skates. To make one ice skate out of cardboard, you will need two small rectangles a little longer and wider than your action figure\u2019s foot. One rectangle represents the shoe and will be glued to the foot of your action figure. The other rectangle represents the blade. Attach it vertically to the shoe (the first rectangle). This makes one skate. Repeat for the second skate.\u00a0What impressions do skates make on the flour and on ice? Can you easily knock over an action figure balancing on skates? Why do you think this is the case? Why would athletes competing on snow wear skis, while athletes competing on ice would wear skates?",
            "Were the action figure\u2019s footprints shallower when it was wearing skis? Was it harder to push your action figure with skis into the flour, and was it harder to knock it over to the front and the back compared to the action figure without the skis on? This is expected.",
            "Skis create a large contact area between the skier and the snow. Therefore, the weight of the skier \u2014 or how much Earth pulls on him \u2014 is spread out over a larger area. The skier presses less on each square inch of snow, and instead of sinking into it, he or she can glide over it. You could also feel this when you pushed your action figure into the flour. Without the skis, it was easy. With the skis, your force was distributed over a large area. It was more difficult to make the action figure sink into the flour.",
            "Skis also help with stability. It is easier to keep your balance when you have a bigger contact area. Think about how you tend to fall forward or backward when you stand on your toes. Standing on flat feet is easier. Similarly, skis extend the feet, making it hard to fall forward or backward, but as skis barely extend your feet to the side, skiers can still easily fall to either side.",
            "Athletes competing on ice use skates because they want their weight concentrated on a small area. This gives them a better grip on the ice, making it easier to push off and jump or gain forward speed. Skates are also far shorter, which allows for tight turns and graceful moves that would never be possible with skis.",

            "This time of year, \u201cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\u201d is nearly inescapable. As the song goes, Rudolph is bullied for having a nose so bright it glows (like a lightbulb!). But one fateful Christmas Eve, his much-mocked nose makes Rudolph a hero. Using it as a beacon, Rudolph guides Santa\u2019s flying sleigh through a foggy night to deliver gifts around the world.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Rudolph\u2019s super-bright snout might seem as fantastical as his ability to fly. But a light-up body part needs no holiday magic. Many animals radiate a whole rainbow of colors through bioluminescence.\u00a0",
            "Given what we know about real animals that glow, a reindeer sporting a luminous nose would be unusual. Still, having a built-in red headlight would make a great adaptive trait for sleigh-pulling reindeer. Rudolph\u2019s red nose just might look a little different to someone on the ground.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Most bioluminescent animals use the same simple chemical reaction to light up cells in their bodies. It takes only two main ingredients. The first is a compound called a luciferin. The other is an enzyme called a luciferase. \u201cWhen oxygen is present in the cell, they react together and they give off light,\u201d says Danielle DeLeo. This marine biologist studies bioluminescence at Florida International University in Miami.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Mixing and matching different luciferins and luciferases creates different colors. Bioluminescent reactions light up the eerie bluish-green lanterns that dangle from anglerfish. They give certain marine worms a purple shimmer. And they illuminate fireflies\u2019 flashy backsides with a variety of colors.\u00a0",

            "A lot of bioluminescence is near the blue end of the color spectrum. But some animals \u2014 such as fireflies, \u201crailroad worm\u201d beetles and some dragonfish \u2014 can glow red. Much like Rudolph, red-lit critters often do it to navigate dark and murky places.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Some deep-sea fish glow red, DeLeo says. Red light can\u2019t travel far through seawater. But in the pitch black of the deep sea, \u201cyou can use that light to kind of see short distances,\u201d she says. \u201cAnimals that might be a little bit further away from you aren\u2019t going to pick up on that red light and then attack you.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In foggy air, on the other hand, red light cuts through the gloom. Red has the longest wavelengths of any color we can see. With those longer wavelengths, it\u2019s less likely to be scattered by water droplets in foggy air, says Nathaniel Dominy. \u201cBlue light, green light, yellow light will scatter. Red light will travel far.\u201d Dominy is an evolutionary biologist who studies mammal color vision. He works at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.\u00a0",
            "If a sleigh-pulling reindeer were going to have a glowing nose, red would be the best color for it, says Dominy. \u201cFor Rudolph, that red light is going to allow them to navigate under foggy conditions more effectively than any other light.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The odds of this trait evolving in reindeer, though, is \u201cvery, very low,\u201d DeLeo says. Most bioluminescent animals are found in the ocean. And among the land animals that do glow, none are mammals. Still, it\u2019s not impossible for bioluminescence to emerge in a new species. \u201cIt\u2019s evolved at least 100 times across the tree of life,\u201d DeLeo notes.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "To someone on the ground who spied Rudolph flying, his nose might not look red at all. The reason is that when a light source is moving toward you, its light waves get squished and look bluer. When it\u2019s moving away, its light waves get stretched out and appear redder.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe don\u2019t see that typically around us, because things have to travel really fast for the redshift or the blueshift,\u201d says Laura Driessen. She\u2019s a radio astronomer at the University of Sydney in Australia. Santa\u2019s sleigh could be an exception. Driessen estimates that to visit every house in the world with kids who celebrate Christmas, Santa would have to tear through the sky at 8.2 million kilometers per hour (5 million miles per hour). That\u2019s nearly 1 percent the speed of light.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Santa might have to move even faster to have enough time to sneak down chimneys, arrange gifts under trees and maybe enjoy some milk and cookies, Driessen says. Say Santa travels at 10 percent the speed of light. As Rudolph approaches a house, his nose would be blueshifted to look orange. As he flies away, his nose would redshift to nearly the deepest crimson human eyes can see \u2014 so dark it would look almost black.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Rudolph\u2019s nose wouldn\u2019t be the only thing blueshifted and redshifted, either. Blueshifted brown hues, for instance, would take on a greenish tinge. \u201cWe\u2019d see a green sleigh and reindeer coming towards us. Then, for the brief moment that [Santa] has stopped and chucked the presents down our chimney, everything would look the normal color,\u201d Driessen says. As they moved away, Santa and his reindeer would almost disappear as they went into infrared.\u00a0",
            "Such fast movement and a brightly glowing nose would cost Rudolph a lot of energy, Dominy notes. \u201cI would want to make sure that he could get as much energy as possible. Sugary foods.\u201d So anyone leaving out treats for Santa this Christmas Eve should be sure to leave out plenty of cookies for his reindeer, too.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "Winter\u2019s shorter days may make people more prone to infection, he says. Less sunlight means people\u2019s bodies make less vitamin D. That vitamin helps the immune system fight off disease. But that\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle.",

In places that have four distinct seasons, these viruses cause more illness in winter. They also spread more during rainy seasons in tropical zones. COVID-19 spreads more easily indoors than outside, too.",
            "Here are four reasons why winter is cold and flu season. #winter #sick #virus #science #learnitontiktok",
            "Why? These infections are caused by viruses that travel in small droplets. Such droplets are a type of aerosol. They can be released into the air when sick people exhale.",
            "\u201cOutdoors, you\u2019re in the ultimate well-ventilated space,\u201d says David Fisman. He is an epidemiologist in Canada. He works at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Viruses exhaled outdoors quickly mix with clean air, he explains. This dilution makes it harder for the viruses to reach people.",
            "But inside, aerosols \u2014 including any viruses \u2014 can build up. \u201cThe air you breathe in is often air that other people have breathed out,\u201d Fisman says. Being close to contagious people could increase your chance of getting sick.\u00a0",
            "But being inside can\u2019t be the whole reason people tend to get sick in winter, says Benjamin Bleier. He is a doctor who specializes in sinus and nasal disorders. He works at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cIn modern society, we\u2019re indoors all year round,\u201d he says. So to drive the seasonal pattern, he says, something else must be going on. Bleier thinks people must become more prone to infection in winter. And the amount of virus circulating must go up, he says.",
            "Some viruses thrive in winter. The reason may not be cold temperatures but low humidity (low levels of moisture in air).",
            "Take flu viruses and SARS-CoV-2. That\u2019s the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Those viruses survive best when the relative humidity falls below about 40 percent. Marr and other researchers made that discovery.",
            "Viruses are sensitive to humidity because they aren\u2019t usually floating around naked, Marr explains. They are encased in droplets of fluid (think spit or snot) \u2014 which can dry up in low humidity. Those droplets also have bits of mucus, proteins, salt and other substances in them. Those other components may determine if the virus survives drying.",
            "When the humidity is higher, droplets dry slowly. Such slow drying concentrates salt and other things in the droplets that can harm a virus. That kills viruses such as influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. Marr and her colleagues reported that finding last July in a paper posted on bioRxiv.org. (Studies posted there have not yet been vetted by other scientists.)",
            "Meanwhile, in low humidity, droplets dry fast. That flash-drying in parched air preserves viruses. \u201cIf the air is very dry, the water quickly evaporates. Everything is dried down, and it\u2019s almost like things are frozen in place,\u201d Marr says.",
            "Viruses often travel through the air inside airborne droplets, or aerosols. When the air is dry, aerosols dry quickly (left). This drying encloses viruses in a layer of crystals that look like feathers (as this microscope image shows). That flash-drying protects viruses, although scientists don\u2019t know exactly how. At medium levels of humidity, crystals form inside liquid droplets (middle). Those crystals may inactivate viruses, not protect them. At high humidity levels (right), aerosols remain liquid. This also allows viruses to survive better than at mid-level humidity.",
            "*_Explainer_Why_it\u2019s_easier_to_get_sick_in_the_winter1",
            "Drier, smaller aerosols also are more buoyant than large droplets. So, those aerosols can hang in the air longer. That ups the chance someone will be able to breathe them in, Fisman says.",
            "What\u2019s more, dry air can tear down some of our defenses against viruses. Dry air can trigger the death of some cells lining the airways. That could leave cracks where viruses can invade. Scientists know this from studies in lab animals.",
            "Mucus in the airways can trap viruses and help protect against infection. That mucus carries germs out of the body through a runny nose or hacked-up phlegm. But breathing cold, dry air can slow the system that moves mucus out of the body. That slowdown may give viruses time to break out of the mucus trap and invade cells, Fisman says.",
            "Temperature changes can also impact the immune system \u2014 an important defense against disease.",
            "Normally, the immune system employs a trick to help ward off viruses. Bleier is part of a team that recently discovered this trick. Cells in the nose are studded with surface proteins that can detect viruses. Other cells in the body also have virus sensors. When one of these sensor proteins sees a virus coming, it signals the cell to release tiny bubbles. Those bubbles \u2014 called extracellular vesicles \u2014 work as decoys. Viruses may go after them instead of infecting real cells.",
            "The virus that docks with one of the bubbles is in for a surprise. Inside the vesicles are virus-killing bits of genetic material. They\u2019re called microRNAs. One type of microRNA in the bubbles is known as miR-17. It can kill multiple types of cold-causing viruses. Bleier\u2019s team shared those findings December 6, 2022, in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.",
            "Cold temps may impede the body\u2019s ability to make such virus-killing decoy bubbles. Bleier\u2019s team grew human nasal cells in lab dishes at 37\u00b0 Celsius (98.6\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That is our typical body temperature. The researchers measured how many bubbles the cells released. Then, the scientists lowered the thermostat to 32\u00b0 C (89.6\u00b0 F). Cells released about 42 percent fewer bubbles at the cooler temperature. What\u2019s more, those vesicles carried fewer virus-killing weapons. Vesicles can pack in about 24 percent more microRNA at body temperature than when it is cooler.",
            "The body\u2019s immune system uses a clever trick to keep viruses from infecting cells in the nose. When the body detects viruses (black and gray spheres), cells in the nose release bubbles (blue circles). These bubbles are called extracellular vesicles. The bubbles sport proteins (red, blue and black shapes on blue circles) like ones found on nasal cells. This makes them effective decoys: Viruses may go after the bubbles instead of infecting real cells. But when it gets cold (right), cells release fewer bubbles. This makes it easier for viruses to find and infect real nasal cells.",

            "What can people do to protect themselves from viruses in the winter? Some experts suggest using a humidifier to raise moisture levels in the air. If they raise it high enough, that might slow the drying of airborne droplets. Such a slow drying might help kill any viruses in the droplets.",
            "\u201cAny increase in humidity should be beneficial,\u201d says Shaman. \u201cYou get a lot of bang for your buck if you go from very dry [air] to dry.\u201d",
            "But Donald Milton doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to pump a lot of moisture into a house when it is cold outside. \u201cThat humidity is going to find \u2026 cold spaces in your house and condense there.\u201d Condensation creates a breeding ground for mold and rot, says Milton. He studies viruses in the air. He works at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. That\u2019s in College Park.",
            "Instead of boosting humidity, Milton advises turning on kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans. That boosts ventilation. And use HEPA filters or Corsi-Rosenthal boxes. They filter unwanted viruses out of the air.",
            "Bleier suggests wearing a mask. Masks don\u2019t just filter out viruses. \u201cOur work suggests these masks have a second mechanism of action,\u201d he says. \u201cThey keep a cushion of warm [moist] air in front of our noses, which could help bolster the immune system.\u201d"

Most come as individuals, although some can fall as multi-flake clumps. What all have in common is their source: clouds that usually hover at least a kilometer (0.6\u00a0mile) above the ground.",
            "*370_snowflake_collisionspng",
            "fCWhen snowflakes collide, their branches can tangle. This can create a compound flake. This often leads to whoppers (like those in first and third rows) by the time the flakes land.",
            "In winter, the air up there can be very cold \u2014 and will get chillier the higher you go. To form snowflakes, those clouds need to be below freezing. But not too cold. Snowflakes form from the moisture in a cloud. If the air gets too cold, a cloud won\u2019t hold enough water for anything to precipitate out. So there has to be a balance. That\u2019s why most flakes develop at or just below freezing \u2014 0\u00ba Celsius (32\u00ba Fahrenheit). Snow can form in cooler environments, but the colder it gets, the less moisture will be available to make a snowflake.",
            "In fact, a cloud\u2019s air has to be supersaturated with moisture for a flake to form. That means there is more water in the air than would normally be possible. (The relative humidity can reach 101 percent during supersaturation. That means there is 1 percent more water in the air than it should be able to hold.)",
            "When there is too much liquid water in the air, a cloud will try to rid itself of the excess. Some of that excess can flash freeze into crystals, which then lazily meander to the ground.",
            "Or that\u2019s the simple answer. The details aren\u2019t quite that straightforward.",
            "One more thing is needed to turn cloud moisture into a flake. Scientists call it a nucleus (NOO-klee-uhs). Without something to glom onto, water droplets can\u2019t freeze. Even when the air temperature is well below freezing, water droplets will remain liquid \u2014 at least until they have a solid object onto which they can attach.",
            "Usually, that will be something like a pollen grain, dust particle or some other airborne bit. It could be smoglike aerosols or the volatile organic compounds released by plants. Even tiny soot particles or microscopic metal bits spewed in a car\u2019s exhaust could become the nuclei around which snowflakes crystalize.",
            "Indeed, when the air is very clean, it can be very difficult for a cloud\u2019s moisture to find a nucleus.",
            "Near the ground, any object can prove a suitable freeze-onto zone. That\u2019s how we get rime ice to form on the branches of trees, light poles or vehicles. Different from frost, rime ice develops when supercooled water droplets freeze onto subfreezing surfaces. (In contrast, frost forms when moisture collects on surfaces in liquid form, and then freezes.)\u00a0",
            "High in a cloud, there have to be some tiny floating particles for snow crystals to develop. When the right conditions do emerge, supercooled drops of water will latch onto these nuclei (NOO-klee-eye). They do it one by one, building an ice crystal.",
            "To understand what\u2019s behind a snowflake\u2019s intricate and complex shape, scientists turn to chemistry \u2014 the action of atoms.",
            "A molecule of water, or H2O, is made of two hydrogen atoms bound to an oxygen atom. This trio\u00a0combines into a \u201cMickey Mouse\u201d pattern. That\u2019s due to polar covalent (Koh-VAY-lent) bonds. The term refers to three atoms that each share electrons with one another, but unevenly.",

            "The oxygen\u2019s nucleus is larger, so it has more pull. It yanks more strongly at the negatively charged electrons that they share. This brings those electrons a little closer. It also gives the oxygen a relative negative electric charge. The two hydrogen atoms end up a tad positive, in terms of charge.",
            "Alone, the structure of a water molecule resembles a wide V. But when multiple H2O molecules find themselves close to one another, they begin to pivot so that their electrical charges pair up. Opposite charges attract. So a negative hydrogen aims itself towards a positive oxygen. The shape that tends to result: a hexagon.",
            "That\u2019s why snowflakes have six sides. It stems from the hexagonal \u2014 six-sided \u2014 structure of most ice crystals. And hexagons team up. They link with other hexagons, growing outward.",
            "That\u2019s how a snowflake is born.",
            "Each hexagon contains a lot of empty space. This explains why ice floats on water;\u00a0it\u2019s less dense. Warmer H2O molecules in the liquid phase are too energetic to settle into a rigid hexagon. As a result, the same number of H2O molecules occupy 9 percent more space as solid ice than they do as liquid water.",
            "Depending on the temperature, these hexagons join with each other and grow in different ways. Sometimes, they make needles. Others may form branch-like dendrites. All are beautiful. And all have their own unique story of crystal growth.",

            "These short-lived crystals still enthrall scientists. To better capture their shape and movement, Tim Garrett at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City recently built a better snowflake camera. He\u2019s been using it to get an inside view of the\u00a0 variety of flakes that fall.",

Scientists are still probing how temperature and humidity affect a flake\u2019s shape.",
            "1. A typical snowflake may contain 1,000,000,000,000,000,000, or one\u00a0quintillion\u00a0water molecules.\u00a0That\u2019s a million times a million times a million! Those building blocks can configure themselves in a virtually infinite array of patterns. So it stands to reason that no two snowflakes that you encounter will ever be exactly the same.",
            "2. Snowflakes tend to be less than a coin\u2019s width in diameter. But once in a while, true whoppers form. In January 1887, a Montana rancher reported snowflakes \u201clarger than milkpans.\u201d That would make them some 38 centimeters (15 inches) across. As that was back before portable home cameras, this number can be challenged. But snowflakes larger than 15.2 centimeters (6 inches) do sometimes develop. Biggies tend to form when temps are near freezing and the air humid. A snowflake\u2019s size also reflects other factors. These include wind speed and direction, dew point \u2014 even how electrified different layers of the atmosphere are. But nobody has ever really conducted measurements when gigantic flakes were flying.3. Most snowflakes fall at roughly a walking pace \u2014 between 1.6 and 6.4 kilometers (1 and 4 miles) per hour.",
            "4.\u00a0With the cloud in which flakes form usually one to two kilometers (0.6\u00a0to 1.2 miles) up, each crystalline wonder may drift anywhere from 10 minutes to more than an hour before reaching the ground. Sometimes, they get carried back up, and it takes several tries for them to reach the ground."

Now scientists have uncovered the strategy these birds use to make it through those cold nights: They chill out.",
            "As the sun goes down and it gets cold, these hummingbirds land for the night. Then they enter torpor, a state of suspended animation. They no longer move. Their heart rate slows way down. And their body temperature dives. One species, the black metaltail (Metallura phoebe), chills to 3.26\u00b0 Celsius (37.8\u00b0 Fahrenheit), the new study shows.",

            "Keeping warm at night takes energy. As endothermic animals, mammals and birds fuel their body heat with food. This lets them stay active when it\u2019s cooler outside. But some of that heat gets lost through the skin. And small critters lose a bigger share of that heat. Their small bodies also mean they can\u2019t generate heat as quickly as bigger animals.",
            "Being super-small, hummingbirds may weigh only about six grams \u2014 about as much as a U.S. quarter. To fuel their flights, a hummingbird needs nectar from 500 flowers a day. So they don\u2019t waste energy on trying to stay warm all night.\u00a0",
            "Blair Wolf studies how such animals\u2019 bodies adapt to their environment. He works at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.

All six species entered some kind of torpor. But the black metaltail cooled the most. It dropped from a daytime temperature of about 40 \u00b0C (104 \u00b0F) to just above freezing.\u00a0",

But during torpor, that rate plummets to as few as 40 beats a minute. \u201cIt\u2019s an astounding drop,\u201d Wolf says. It could allow these high-altitude birds to cut their energy use by about 95 percent, he says. By not wasting energy trying to stay warm at night, these birds can thrive as high as 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) above sea level. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable adaptation.\u201d",

            "Some plants \u2014 like the poplar trees bordering this wheat field \u2014 can communicate with each other by sending messages through the air.",
            "It\u2019s a pleasant summer morning. Across a field, a line of poplar trees sways in the breeze. Insects buzz and flit among the branches. Everything seems calm and peaceful.",
            "But don\u2019t be fooled. These trees are actually under attack as hungry insects chomp on their leaves.",
            "The trees can\u2019t hide, and they can\u2019t run away. But they aren\u2019t helpless: They have ways to fight back \u2014 and even aid each other. As soon as an insect starts gnawing on a leaf, the tree mounts defenses. It also quickly messages its neighbors: \u201cWe\u2019re under attack! Get your defenses ready!\u201d It might even call on other insects for help.",

            "All of this happens in ways we don\u2019t see. But scientists are learning that plants can do many things we associate with thinking. Plants communicate with each other. They can learn. They form memories. They can even recognize their relatives. And they do all this without a brain.",
            "Could these abilities mean plants are intelligent? We may never fully know. As Simon Gilroy puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to think like a vegetable.\u201d Still, researchers are working to get to the root of what\u2019s going on when plants act in ways we once thought only animals could.",
            "\u201cWhen you look at a tree,\u201d says Gilroy, \u201cit looks like it\u2019s doing absolutely nothing.\u201d Gilroy is a botanist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. He\u2019s also one of several scientists who\u2019ve been taking a close look at plant behavior. They\u2019re finding that though plants seem still and quiet, they\u2019re actually quite busy.",
            "And what they\u2019re busy doing is pretty amazing.",
            "In the 1980s, botanists first found signs that plants communicate with each other. In one early experiment, hurt trees seemed to warn their neighbors of danger.",
            "*a_dim_green_forest_full_of_trees",
            "fCthrough underground fungal networks",
            "Back then, Jack Schultz and Ian Baldwin were young researchers at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. They potted up tree seedlings and sealed them inside a clear plastic container. Each had its own pot, and the trees didn\u2019t touch each other.",
            "When the researchers tore leaves on one tree, it responded by producing a chemical to repel attackers. Then, about 36 hours later, the undamaged trees made the same chemical. The hurt tree must have sent a signal through the air to the others, the team concluded.",
            "Some people described this as plants \u201ctalking\u201d to each other. The finding, reported in 1983, launched the science of plant communication.",
            "Since then, scientists have shown this communication can be fairly complex.",
            "Plants respond better to messages from close kin than to ones from unrelated plants. It\u2019s something Rick Karban has shown. At the University of California, Davis, he studies how plants and insects interact. Work by his group and others shows plants can tell one predator from another. They send different signals depending on what type of insect is attacking.",
            "Their messages can even signal how far away danger is, a team in Finland now reports. It shared that finding September 12 in Science.",
            "*a_green_worm_chews_on_a_tomato_leaf,_with_small_tomatoes_to_the_left",
            "When a tomato hornworm chews on a tomato leaf, the plant releases an odor that attracts the worm\u2019s parasites.",
            "And not all plant messages are intended for other plants. Some are meant to lure in critters that eat whatever\u2019s feeding on the plants. When nibbled by tomato hornworms, for instance, tomato plants release chemicals that attract the hornworm\u2019s enemies, explains Schultz. He now works at the University of Houston in Texas.",
            "Plants can even use more than one \u201clanguage.\u201d Most studies have focused on chemical signals. But plants sometimes use sound, too.",
            "In 2023, a team in Tel Aviv, Israel, recorded clicks and pops made by plants under stress. The sounds varied across plant species and type of stress, such as drought and being cut. Although roughly as loud as human speech, they\u2019re too high-pitched for people to hear. Other animals, however, such as bats, mice and insects, might be able to hear them, the researchers note.",
            "Stressed tomato plants make distinctive clicking noises that can be picked up by ultrasonic microphones. In this clip, scientists condensed the sounds and brought them into the range of human hearing.",
            "*illustration_of_a_microphone_next_to_a_plant",
            "So might other plants. There\u2019s lot of evidence that plants respond to sounds, says Heidi Appel. She\u2019s a plant ecologist at the University of Houston. For instance, plants can hear when insects munch on their leaves, her team has shown.",
            "Other work suggests that plants can learn and even remember. One famous study in 2014 used a plant called Mimosa pudica. Known for being \u201csensitive,\u201d it curls its leaves when it\u2019s disturbed.",
            "The researchers potted up dozens of these plants. Then they dropped each Mimosa 60 times in a row. The plants weren\u2019t harmed by the drop. It was short, with a soft landing. And they curled their leaves \u2014 but only the first few times. Pretty quickly, they stopped reacting.",
            "Just to be sure the plants weren\u2019t too tired to fold their leaves, the researchers shook the plants. Now they curled their leaves right away. But when dropped again, they didn\u2019t curl them. The plants had learned that the drop wasn\u2019t going to hurt them, the researchers concluded.",
            "A month later, they tried the experiment again. The plants still didn\u2019t curl their leaves after being dropped. It was as though they remembered it wouldn\u2019t hurt them. They had formed long-lasting memories.",
            "It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that plants can do all these things, Gilroy says.",
            "\u201cEverything that\u2019s alive has to solve the same problems,\u201d he notes. \u201cPlants have to feed themselves. Plants have to get water. Plants have to defend themselves.\u201d",
            "But plants solve these problems very differently than animals do. A hungry person might chase down a deer or search out fruits. A plant\u2019s food comes from sunlight, carbon in the air and nutrients in the soil.",
            "And a plant can\u2019t swat or avoid insects, as we might. Instead, they\u2019ve evolved their own ways to solve problems. Plants turn to follow the light. They deter bugs by making bitter compounds. They send roots toward water and nutrients. They even release chemicals that change the soil to make it better for the plant, says Gilroy.",
            "None of this involves a brain or nervous system.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/u2GWd2j3qJ8?feature=oembed",
            "Plants have adapted some impressive abilities that make up for being unable to move.",
            "How do plants remember and send messages without a nervous system? The researchers who dropped the mimosa plants had an idea about that. They suggested that there may be other ways to remember.",
            "Neurons, or nerve cells, send messages via chemicals called neurotransmitters. Even though plants don\u2019t have a nervous system, they have many of the same neurotransmitters that animals have.",
            "One of those is glutamate. Wounded leaves use glutamate to send messages. These signals tell undamaged leaves to boost their defenses against possible threats, notes Edward Farmer. A plant biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, he and his team published this finding back in 2013.",
            "Since then, other teams have learned more about how this messaging works. And it\u2019s very similar to how neural signaling works in animals \u2014 but maybe better, Gilroy and his team show.",
            "*a_diagram_of_xylem_left_and_phloem_right_with_a_potted_plant_in_the_middle",
            "The xylem and phloem that transport water and nutrients through plants also carry neurotransmitters. Some scientists see this as a kind of nervous system for plants.",
            "Plants have what Gilroy calls a plumbing system. This system of tubes, called xylem and phloem, moves water and nutrients around the plant\u2019s body. Plants use this plumbing like a nervous system, he says. Neurotransmitters can move around their bodies through these tubes. No nerve cells needed.",
            "\u201cPlants have to do it better than human beings,\u201d says Gilroy. They can\u2019t run away when something bad is happening. They have to know exactly what\u2019s going on and how to respond. \u201cSo the information processing must be really sophisticated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just not like ours.\u201d",
            "These discoveries show plants are able to do far more than meets our eyes. But does this mean that plants are intelligent? Some scientists think so. Others are not so sure. The problem may trace to how we define words like \u201cthinking\u201d and \u201cintelligence.\u201d Still, this has become a big controversy among botanists.",
            "Elizabeth Van Volkenburgh is a plant biologist at the University of Washington. That\u2019s in Seattle. She\u2019s a founding member of The Society of Plant Signaling and Behavior. It had once been called the Society for Plant Neurobiology. But some scientists thought the term \u201cneurobiology\u201d was a poor fit. After all, plants don\u2019t have nervous systems.",
            "Some scientists are \u201cvery, very, very [against] the idea of plant neurobiology,\u201d she says. But Van Volkenburgh likes the term. Technically, a plant lacks nerves. Still, it has a sensory system. What\u2019s more, she points out, \u201cIn the older scientific literature, xylem and phloem were referred to as nerves.\u201d",
            "The idea that plants can hear was a hard sell 10 years ago, Appel recalls. She\u2019s married to Jack Schultz, and even he was skeptical. \u201dAnd he\u2019s the one who discovered talking plants,\u201d she says, laughing.",
            "Even now, this idea raises questions.",
            "\u201cWe do know that plants respond to vibrations in their environment. There\u2019s no debate about that,\u201d Appel says. However, whether plants can \u201chear\u201d seems to depend on what you mean by that term. \u201cIf you define hearing as detecting vibrations in the environment, recognizing different kinds of vibrations and responding in an appropriate way,\u201d she says, \u201cthen yes, plants can hear.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean plants think about what they hear in the same way we would, though.",
            "And as to whether plants are intelligent in the way we think of human intelligence, Appel says we just don\u2019t know. \u201cThese are mysteries we\u2019re trying to understand.\u201d Still, she argues, we need to resolve this controversy. And that means doing more science.",
            "*A_man_in_a_blue_shirt_kneels_among_a_scrubby,_rocky_landscape,_a_pencil_in_hand_and_notebook_in_his_",
            "Rick Karban is surveying plants to see how many leaves have been attacked by insects (mostly beetles and grasshoppers). That count will give an idea of how effective a plant\u2019s defenses have been.",
            "Or maybe it\u2019s not a question we have to answer, counters Karban at Davis. \u201cMany people in this field are upset and don\u2019t like the word \u2018intelligence.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it is just about words.\u201d",
            "Words can be hard to define, agrees Andre Kessler. He\u2019s a chemical ecologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. In a paper that came out last April, he addressed what he calls the \u201cplant intelligence hypothesis.\u201d",
            "It\u2019s hard to agree on whether plants are intelligent without first agreeing on what intelligence is, he says. He and Michael Mueller point to one paper that found more than 70 different definitions for intelligence. It would be better, they write, to focus on what plants can do. How do they interact with other organisms, for instance? How do they respond and adapt to their environments? By such measures, Kessler says, plants should be viewed, in some way, as intelligent.",
            "However you describe it, scientists are learning that plants are far more amazing than most people realize. And to amaze us, they don\u2019t have to be like us.",
            "Take a look at the plant on your windowsill or a tree in your garden. It won\u2019t ever be able to pass your math exam. Even if you whisper to it every day, it won\u2019t learn your name. But when it comes to doing what it needs to do \u2014 the things that matter to it as a plant \u2014 it\u2019s remarkable. And it does all that without a nervous system.",

But many of the routines might be more harmful than helpful, a new study shows. The majority of the regimens shown are costly, have harmful ingredients and lack sunscreen. Most don\u2019t offer benefits for young skin. And they may lead to skin damage.",
            "This study suggests that young people are getting a lot of health information from TikTok instead of more reliable sources such as doctors, parents or skincare specialists, says Nusheen Ameenuddin. She\u2019s a pediatrician at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.",

            "When healthcare researcher Tara Lagu asked her 11-year-old niece what she wanted for Christmas, her niece handed her a list of expensive skincare products. According to Lagu\u2019s sister-in-law, all the girl\u2019s friends were taking part in this trend. Lagu was shocked.",

            "To start, Hales and a colleague each made TikTok accounts. They reported that they were 13 years old. Then they scrolled through their \u201cFor You\u201d pages until they had seen 100 skincare routine videos. As they watched, the researchers noted information on the content creators, the products and the cost of each regimen.",
            "Most of the videos were pretty popular. They had an average of more than a million views each. Because the creators\u2019 ages weren\u2019t specified, the team assigned age ranges based on appearance and context clues. For example, in one video a creator said, \u201cGet ready with me for the first day of sixth grade.\u201d Most creators used an average of six products, which on average cost a total of $168.",

            "A post shared by Science News Explores (@sn.explores)",
            "More than half of the products had fragrance. Many scents are contact allergens. That means they can cause an allergic reaction when they come in contact with skin. They are one of the most common things people develop a skin allergy to, says Hales.",
            "Plus, the 25 most-viewed videos had an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients. These can cause an itching, burning, tingling or prickling sensation.",
            "The most common of these ingredients were alpha-hydroxy acids. These chemicals exfoliate skin, removing surface layers. They\u2019re common in anti-aging products because they can smooth fine lines and wrinkles and improve skin texture. They\u2019re also used in some products to prevent acne. But they can irritate and damage young skin.",
            "Creators used products with alpha-hydroxy acids an average of three times per video and as many as seven times in one regimen. This is harmful because the chemical becomes more irritating the more you layer it.",
            "Alpha-hydroxy acids also increase the skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends staying out of the sun and using sunscreen with these products. But on average, only 26 percent of the TikTok videos included any type of sun protection. So these regimens would boost the risk of sunburn and other sun damage.",
            "Though not part of the study, pediatrician Molly O\u2019Shea was distressed by the findings. \u201cThe majority of the products that were being shown and demonstrated weren\u2019t designed for young skin,\u201d says O\u2019Shea. She practices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.",
            "Many of the products had abrasive features, such as retinols, scrubs and beads, that can damage the skin. These types of products are usually meant for people whose skin has begun to show signs of aging, says O\u2019Shea. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, using products that are designed for older skin can actually damage your skin.\u201d",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Beyond risks to the skin, the team also had concerns about potential psychological and social risks.",
            "The videos place high importance on physical appearance, Hales says. And much of the content showed creators in large, expensive, private bedrooms and bathrooms. They had drawers stuffed with high-priced skincare products.",
            "The products seemed to be used as status symbols, says Hales. \u201cThat may make someone feel bad if they don\u2019t have the money or they\u2019re not in a position to be able to afford that kind of skincare routine.\u201d Studies have shown that comparing yourself to others who seem \u201cbetter\u201d can have big drawbacks, especially for teens. \u201cIt can have a harmful effect on your self-image,\u201d says Hales.",
            "The study didn\u2019t look at who was consuming this content, says Hales. But this type of media could pose a risk of adverse mental health outcomes for kids and teens who view it, she notes.",
            "The team also paid attention to skin tone. In the United States, beauty standards traditionally have been linked to ideals of whiteness. The researchers wanted to see if the videos idealized white skin.",
            "The majority of content creators they viewed had light skin. But since TikTok\u2019s feed is driven by an algorithm, the researchers don\u2019t know how well what they saw reflects the whole platform. The early videos they saw and engaged with may have prompted more videos from creators with light skin to appear in their feed.",

At that point, she advises teens to talk to their doctor. \u201cPediatricians are usually very equipped to manage mild to moderate acne,\u201d says Hales. If it\u2019s anything more severe, she recommends seeing a dermatologist.",

Second, read the labels of the products you\u2019re using and see what kind of active ingredients they have. Third, look for fragrance-free products, since fragrance is the most common cause of skin allergy.",

But know that you don\u2019t need elaborate skincare routines to take care of your skin. \u201cIn most cases,\u201d she says, \u201cthose products are probably making the skin less healthy, rather than more healthy.\u201d"

            "A handheld 3-D printer might someday print bone grafts directly onto fractures. Researchers prototyped the idea with a modified glue gun. They included antibiotics in the material to ease healing.",
            "A repurposed glue gun has helped repair broken bones in rabbits. Instead of a regular glue stick, it melts a material that helps bones heal.",
            "Some breaks in bones need a little help to mend. So surgeons sometimes take a bit of bone from elsewhere in the body to make a patch called a graft. Or they can use a synthetic \u2014 human-made \u2014 material that mimics bone.",
            "Synthetic grafts are often 3-D printed. Usually, X-ray scans and measurements of injuries are needed to make sure the graft will fit just right. Designing and making the graft takes time and can delay repairs.",
            "But the glue gun method doesn\u2019t require images of the fracture. And it doesn\u2019t need any special graft design. The handheld device can simply squirt the graft material right onto a break. ",
            "The idea was to design a printing system that could be easily used in operating rooms, says Jung Seung Lee. He\u2019s a biomedical engineer at Sungkyunkwan University. That\u2019s in Seoul, South Korea. Compared with regular bone grafts, he says, this system can save time, cost and complex procedures.",
            "The printing device holds sticks of a specially made \u201cbioink.\u201d It\u2019s safe to use in the body. It consists of two compounds commonly used for 3-D printing implants. One, hydroxyapatite, is a mineral found in bones. The other is a body-safe plastic called polycaprolactone, or PCL. That\u2019s included to support new bone as it grows. In an implant, it \u201cgradually degrades in our body over months,\u201d Lee says. Over time, newly grown bone will fill in as the graft breaks down.",
            "The ratio of the two compounds in the bioink determines the material\u2019s strength and stiffness. So the researchers can tailor the mixture for each use. They also added antibiotics into the bioink to prevent infections.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Like the glue sticks used for crafting, the bioink fits in the handheld printer. It can be squeezed out where it\u2019s needed. But regular hot glue guns work at temperatures far too high for living tissues.",
            "So the researchers modified their glue gun to work at lower temperatures. They also adjusted the tip for better control. Thanks to the low melting point of PCL, the bioink can be applied at about 60\u00b0 Celsius (140\u00b0 Fahrenheit). It cools to body temperature within 40 seconds. The whole process takes just a few minutes.",
            "Lee\u2019s team tested the printer and bioink on broken leg bones in rabbits. Another set of rabbits got a material called bone cement, which is used to attach implants to bones. The rabbits that got the bioink had better healing and regrowth of bone tissue. And the animals showed no signs of infection during the 12 weeks after surgery. The team shared its results September 5 in Device.",
            "For now, the printer is still a proof-of-concept for people. Lee aims to develop it into a multi-use printing system. For instance, it might apply chemicals that promote healing during surgeries. But first, researchers will have to do more studies to make sure the technology is safe. They\u2019ll also need to figure out how to disinfect the device between uses.",
            "There may be other limitations. \u201cThe high temperature of the extruded material is likely to stress or kill the cells,\u201d says Deborah Mason. She\u2019s a molecular and cell biologist at Cardiff University in Wales. She wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Lee\u2019s team is working to modify the tip of the device. That could help the bioink cool more quickly after extrusion.",
            "In the future, this sort of device could help surgeons with more complex repairs, suggests Nieves Cubo-Mateo. She\u2019s a biomaterials engineer at Nebrija University in Madrid, Spain. She wasn\u2019t part of the study.",
            "But there is a long way to go for that to happen, she says. The printer would need to work with other tools that surgeons use. Those include imaging technologies and robotic devices used during surgeries. That would take the new device beyond just a \u201cdefect-filler,\u201d she says. Someday, it could be a \u201cbone printer pen\u201d useful for many types of surgeries.",

            "When stressed by heat, trees release chemicals. These can mix with molecules from car exhaust to make toxic air pollutants. And this can happen even where you can\u2019t smell any car exhaust. Atmospheric chemists at Texas A&M University in College Station shared their new findings here, on August 18, at the American Chemical Society fall meeting.",
            "People expect to find air pollution in and around cities. There, vehicles cough pollutants out of their tailpipes. But at Texas A&M, \u201cthe air smells beautiful,\u201d says Renyi Zhang. The campus is about 100 miles away from the closest big city. Here, he notes, the air is usually safe to breathe.",
            "But that may not be true during heat waves. Zhang\u2019s team collected data on campus. During a month-long event in August 2024, daytime temps hit 32\u02da to 41\u02da Celsius (90\u02da to 106\u02da Fahrenheit). And it wasn\u2019t just the heat that made these days uncomfortable. Pollution ramped up, too. Levels of lung-irritating ozone got especially high. It rose nearly to a level deemed hazardous to breathe.",

            "Bianca Aridjis-Olivos, a graduate student in his lab, set up air-monitoring equipment atop the university\u2019s meteorology building. It\u2019s surrounded by grand oak trees. It seemed a good location. It\u2019s high above passing cars and other expected pollution sources.",
            "The instruments she used are \u201clike a super-sensitive nose,\u201d she notes. By changing how they operate, she could alter \u201cwhat scents the nose could detect.\u201d Besides ozone, they could pick up nitrogen oxides from combustion (including gasoline-powered vehicles).",
            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

            "Learn why isoprene \u2014 a chemical released by trees (and lots of other plants) \u2014 can make air pollution worse. It\u2019s the second most widely emitted volatile organic chemical (after methane) in the world. The chemistry explained here underlies the data reported in the new study.",
            "Once all her equipment was ready, Aridjis-Olivos waited for the next heat wave.",
            "It hit in August 2024. From August 5 to September 3, she sampled different gases and particles from the air 24 hours a day.",
            "As the temps rose each day, so did levels of ozone, oxygenated volatile organic chemicals (some of which are toxic to human airways) and acid-rich nanoparticles. Ozone levels, in particular, climbed as the heat rose. Then they stayed high throughout the hottest part of the day. That in itself was no surprise. Trees ramp up isoprene release during heat waves. Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",
            "The surprise was just how high the ozone levels climbed. If you just looked at the levels of other pollutants, like the nitrogen oxides from cars, you might think the air was safe to breathe.",
            "And while a heat wave feels miserable, says Zhang, \u201cexposure to both extreme heat and high ozone can be very dangerous.\u201d",
            "This research shows how \u201cclimate change is making air pollution harder to control,\u201d says Russ Dickerson. An atmospheric chemist, he works at the University of Maryland in College Park. Air pollution is a leading cause of death, he notes. The World Health Organization reports that today 99 percent of people worldwide are exposed to air unhealthy enough to pose a risk to our lungs.",
            "Clearly, trees play a role here. But chopping them down would be the wrong conclusion, he adds. \u201cTrees are generally good. But when you mix them with car and truck exhaust, bad things happen.\u201d",
            "\u201cStudies like this can help us improve our air-quality forecasting models,\u201d says Aara\u2019L Yarber. An atmospheric scientist, she works at Howard University in Washington, D.C. With such computer models, she says, \u201cWe can better predict bad-air days during heat waves.\u201d And that should help protect people\u2019s health.",
            "Data from this study are not limited to modeling sites like College Station, Aridjis-Olivos says. Being \u201csurrounded by vegetation, but also some industry and traffic,\u201d this region is similar to what\u2019s found many places, including in many developing nations.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "If you can\u2019t avoid a heat wave, how can you protect yourself from air pollution that may come with it? Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible. Remember to check your local air quality index when making plans, Yarber says. \u201cKids are especially sensitive to air pollution,\u201d she notes, \u201cbecause their lungs are still growing.\u201d",
            "At home, Dickerson recommends getting a low-cost HEPA filter from a hardware store. For breathing \u201ccleaner air \u2014 averaged over a day \u2014 put a HEPA filter in your bedroom,\u201d he says. As an alternative, you can even duct-tape five furnace filters together. Then direct air through it with an electric fan. Remember to keep the windows closed.",
            "There are also ways to improve outdoor air quality. For instance, communities can work to limit becoming \u201cheat islands.\u201d Two obvious ways: Increase shaded area, and limit how much heat-absorbing concrete they have.",
            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change?

So, oddly, are the more familiar chickens he saw on his way to that hike.",

Think of them like Post-it notes that can easily fall off.",
            "If, however, a more powerful memory comes along shortly afterward, the weaker memory might be saved.",
            "Here\u2019s how it was thought to work. The powerful memory triggers a rush of proteins in the hippocampus and linked areas of the brain. These are areas where memories form. Tagged neurons would capture those proteins. And just like adding a strong glue to the Post-it note, they\u2019d make the weak memories stick to the powerful ones.",
            "Lin and his team decided to test that idea.",
            "They asked more than 100 people to observe sequences of images on a computer. Sometimes people saw animals (such as aardvarks, hamsters or sea stars). Other times they saw everyday tools. Participants initially just viewed these images \u2014 dozens of them. Next, they viewed similar images. This time, they\u2019d be rewarded for labeling them as animals or tools.",
            "About half the participants, for instance, might receive 900 points for identifying a hamster as an animal and 1 point for identifying a hammer as a tool. The other half received the opposite rewards: maybe 900 points for the hammer and 1 point for the hamster.",
            "The next day, the team gave their participants a pop quiz on images they\u2019d seen the day before. And, it turns out, both reward size and type of image sometimes affected what these people remembered.",
            "Receiving a big reward for identifying animals enhanced someone\u2019s memories of animals. Those who received a small reward remembered about 45 percent of the animals they\u2019d seen in the first round. Participants remembered more \u2014 about 50 percent \u2014 if they\u2019d received a large reward for labeling the animals earlier.",
            "This memory boost didn\u2019t work for tools, though. Big rewards didn\u2019t help people remember the tools they\u2019d seen earlier. Lin suspects that\u2019s because people formed strong memories of the tools from the beginning, so adding a reward didn\u2019t provide much more of a benefit.",
            "Rewards for animals also didn\u2019t help people remember which tools they\u2019d seen. It seems the brain links memories within a category, not across different categories.",

            "Sorting out what\u2019s going on in the brain while memories form will take more time.",
            "In the meantime, therapists could use these findings to help people enhance the everyday memories that occurred before a trauma. This might dull the pain of what came after, Lin says. Teachers might also use the findings to help students retain more of what they learn.

            "Acne and other skin blemishes can be especially common during adolescence. New microneedle technology helps some new antibacterial skin patches get a better grip. ",
            "That pimple patch you\u2019re using now is so last year. A new type locks on to pesky pimples better. Its secret is its tiny, uniquely shaped needles. They also help the patches more effectively deliver zit-fighting ingredients. \u00a0",
            "Even if you hate needles, the ones in the new patches shouldn\u2019t spook you. They\u2019re \u201cvery short,\u201d notes Shayan Fakhraei Lahiji \u2014 about 250 micrometers. That\u2019s about one-one hundredth of an inch long. A bioengineer, Lahiji works at Cursus Bio. It\u2019s a drug company in Seoul, South Korea. He helped shape \u2014 literally \u2014 this new approach to acne treatment.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_pimple_patch_on_a_fingertip",
            "The tiny pinpricks of this antibacterial patch dissolve in about two hours, delivering acne-clearing medication.",
            "Each needle-packed patch is about the size of a contact lens and \u201calmost invisible,\u201d he says. Once placed on a pimple, its needles lock in. Over two hours, the tiny pricks dissolve and disappear.\u00a0After that, you can remove the transparent patch, he says.",
            "Hyaluronic (HY-uh-lu-RON-ik) acid \u2014 a chemical that plumps up our skin \u2014 gives structural support to the microneedles. Those tiny needles then deliver antibacterial compounds right where they\u2019re needed. Inflammation-fighting chemicals also cool redness and swelling.",
            "Among tests in treated people, more than eight in 10 of patched pimples disappeared within three days. Details of how the new tech works appear in the July Biological and Medical Applications of Materials and Interfaces.",
            "Lahiji\u2019s team didn\u2019t invent pimple patches. People can buy simpler styles today. Many of those, too, use microneedles. But needles in the new patches have a unique geometry that anchors them in place.\u00a0It sets them apart from what you can buy now, Lahiji says.",
            "The microneedles used in other drug-delivery patches tend to be cone-shaped. But that means they easily slip out of the skin. The Korean team gave their needles a bulb-shaped bottom. They call the design \u201cMicroLock.\u201d Like soft-edged-cylindrical barbs, they lock in place.",
            "Most microneedles are cone-shaped. But the bulb-shaped base of needles on the new patches helps secure them onto the skin.",

            "The value of this shape-up could expand beyond the acne market, Lahiji says.",
            "Slipping out of skin is a known problem with microneedle technology, says Ayhan \u00c7elik. A chemical biologist, he works at Imperial Bioscience Limited. That\u2019s a drug technology company in Brighton, England. \u00c7elik didn\u2019t work on the new study. But he, too, has been working on microneedle patches using hyaluronic acid.",
            "Such patches show a lot of potential, \u00c7elik says. For instance, they might one day provide shot-free options for the delivery of some injectable drugs. Or even vaccines.",
            "Such patches could offer other advantages, too, he adds. A shot puts a lot of the medicine into a tiny area. In contrast, \u00c7elik notes, patches would deliver a drug to a broader area \u2014 \u201cnot a single point.\u201d He believes that will lead to a better immune response than a typical shot.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The needles of the new acne patch are too short to deliver a vaccine. But Lahiji and his team have developed other versions that might enable other uses for the \u201clocking\u201d microneedles.",
            "For now, notes Lahiji, \u201cthere are no microneedle products [for] medicines that require prescriptions.\u201d Or for vaccines. But his team is working on ways that microneedles could deliver such drugs. One type would deliver medicines targeted at diabetes and obesity. His group described it in 2024 in Advanced Materials.",
            "Governments regulate what new medical products can be used in their countries. These rules ensure those products are safe. In the United States, for instance, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, writes those rules. Right now, no such rules exist for microneedle patches, \u00c7elik notes. That makes them a headache for companies to develop and bring to pharmacies. \u201cEveryone is waiting for\u201d those guidelines, he says.",
            "Acne patches are an exception to that. These patches are deemed \u201ccosmetic,\u201d not medical. Their needles not only are extra tiny, but they also deliver no prescription drugs \u2014 just over-the-counter acne-clearing meds.",
            "Locking microneedles might help open the door for patch delivery of other medications. Why? When it comes to prescription drugs, how much a patch dispenses really matters, explains \u00c7elik. The FDA would require a patch to deliver a set dose \u2014 not more, not less. Patches typically lack such consistency.",
            "For example, a patch may deliver 40 percent of the drug one time. The next, it might deliver only 8 percent, notes \u00c7elik. A microneedle patch for prescription medicines, he says, must deliver the same amount of drug \u201ceach and every time.\u201d",
            "By anchoring the new patches in place, the new microneedles should mean that \u201cevery time, they will deliver approximately 80 percent of the drug,\u201d \u00c7elik says. At least, he adds, \u201cThat\u2019s what [its makers now] claim.\u201d",
            "Other problems remain to be solved, such as how big a dose they can dispense. For some drugs, the tiny needles may not be able to deliver enough to have the needed effect, says \u00c7elik. In these cases, they may never fully replace hypodermic needles.",
            "The new acne patch system was developed by Cursus Bio. Its product should hit store shelves in Korea by November, Lahiji says. U.S. consumers will have to wait a few months longer \u2014 until at least next January.",

Maybe crunchy broccoli florets with hummus comes to mind. These are all packed with nutrients \u2014 chemical substances that help our bodies function. Among those nutrients are traces of vitamins.",
            "Food scientists group vitamins and minerals together as micronutrients. That\u2019s because living things need these to survive \u2014 but only in tiny amounts. While both vitamins and minerals are essential, chemically they\u2019re quite different.",
            "Dietary minerals are elements that appear in soil and water. Calcium and iron are examples. Vitamins, in contrast, are molecules \u2014 made of several elements. Vitamins are also organic, meaning they contain the element carbon. ",
            "Our bodies can\u2019t make minerals or most vitamins. That\u2019s why we must get them from what we eat.Altogether, we need 13 vitamins to stay healthy. Eight are known as B vitamins. Rounding out the list are vitamins A, C, D, E and K. These all play essential roles in keeping our organs, tissues and cells working.",
            "Some, such as the B vitamins, help the body break down and release energy from food. Vitamin K allows our blood to clot. Vitamin A is important for our lungs, skin and eyes.Vitamin D is a pro-hormone. The kidneys turn it into a fully active hormone. And it\u2019s quite versatile. This hormone plays a pivotal role in building strong bones and muscles and protecting the body from diseases, including some cancers. This vitamin also helps fight infections.",
            "Other vitamins \u2014 such as C and E \u2014 are antioxidants. They help protect against unstable molecules. At high levels, such molecules, called radicals, can damage cells and DNA.",
            "Vitamin C also supports your immune system in various ways. For instance, it helps keep immune cells healthy. But vitamin C also helps create collagen. A protein, collagen serves as a building block for many tissues, including our skin and the lining of our respiratory system. Those organs act as early lines of defense against incoming germs, explains Evangeline Mantzioris. She directs nutrition and food science at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.By keeping these systems healthy, vitamins help our bodies fight germs, limiting their chance of causing serious disease.",
            "Clearly, Mantzioris says, vitamins don\u2019t just target one specific body function or organ. They make sure our bodies as a whole work as they should.",

These are \u201cfoods that don\u2019t have a lot of fat.\u201d Our bodies don\u2019t usually store any excess of water-soluble vitamins. Instead, unused amounts get flushed out in our urine.\u00a0",

For fat-soluble vitamin K, reach for broccoli and other green (and often leafy) vegetables, beans, avocados, vegetable oils and some meats (such as chicken, pork and especially beef liver). ",
            "Fat-soluble vitamins \u2014 A, D, E and K \u2014 tend to show up in fatty foods. In fact, that fat helps our bodies better absorb these nutrients. Our liver and body will store any extra of these vitamins that we might consume until they\u2019re needed later. \u201cEven if we\u2019re really lean, we still have a little bit of a fat stored in our body,\u201d says Mantzioris. ",
            "The fat-soluble group also includes the two vitamins that people can produce: vitamins D and K. Bacteria in our intestines can make vitamin K.\u00a0",
            "Vitamin D is special. Known as the sunshine vitamin, our skin starts a process of making it by using the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light. Today, most people lack ideal amounts. One reason: Covering up the body too much when in the sun. Sunscreen helps protect against skin cancers but limits vitamin D production. So does spending most of the daylight hours indoors. Darkly pigmented skin and very heavy cloud cover can limit exposure to the UV light that kick-starts vitamin D production. So can living at high latitudes, where a steep path through the atmosphere can filter out much of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light.\u00a0",

            "Vitamins are also available as food supplements sold widely in stores and over the internet. Many are synthetic preparations; others come from plant or animal sources. Some products may include single vitamins. Others may contain a blend meant to meet our daily needs.",
            "But for most of us who eat a balanced diet and get enough sunlight, these products are unnecessary. Instead, focus on eating a healthy diet that includes plenty of produce. Notes Mantzioris, \u201cWe didn\u2019t evolve on supplements. We evolved on whole food.\u201d ",

But these and other types of fresh produce also contain hundreds of other nutrients that aren\u2019t found in artificial supplements, Mantzioris points out. These include plant compounds called phytonutrients. Such compounds give many fruits and veggies their vibrant colors. Scientists suspect they also boost health and fight disease. And new ones are still being discovered. ",
            "Supplements can be useful, though. People with certain medical conditions may need help getting enough of some vitamins. And it\u2019s hard to reach the recommended amount of vitamin D through food alone. Vitamin D supplements may help those with heavily pigmented skin or whose skin doesn\u2019t get access to enough of the sun\u2019s UV rays.But these supplements should only be taken after talking with your doctor, says Mantzioris. One reason: Mixing vitamin supplements with certain medications can be risky. ",
            "Some vitamins, such as A, can be toxic when taken in high amounts. But poisoning is highly unlikely to happen when they\u2019re consumed as part of a balanced diet. Most people who consume too many vitamins do so by taking supplements.Taking too many supplements also risks flooding the body with more nutrients than it can handle. Fat-soluble vitamins can build up in our fat stores over time, leading to dangerous side effects. Even overdosing on some water-soluble vitamins can pose problems.Cases of poisoning from water-soluble vitamin B6, for instance, are on the rise in Australia, notes Mantzioris. In addition to supplements, this nutrient is often added to energy drinks, weight-loss shakes and certain food products. One symptom of too much B6 is nerve damage. It often starts as a tingling in the fingers and toes. \u201cIf it\u2019s not caught in time, it can cause permanent damage,\u201d Mantzioris says.Instead of splurging on supplements, Mantzioris recommends that people looking to stay healthy should focus on a food-first approach. \u201cPeople spend a lot of money on these [vitamin supplements] \u2014 and mostly without a lot of gain,\u201d says Mantzioris. \u201cI would rather spend the money on having really yummy food.\u201d",
