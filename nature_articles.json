            "Faeces and vomit fossils from dinosaurs reveal how the animals evolved to rule Earth. The study, which was published in Nature on 27 November, analysed hundreds of pieces of fossilized digestive material, called bromalites, to reconstruct what dinosaurs ate and how this changed1. The fossils reveal that the rise of the dinosaurs, over millions of years during the Triassic period, was influenced by factors including climate change and other species\u2019 extinction.",
            "\u201cOur study shows that you can use pretty seemingly unremarkable fossils to get pretty remarkable results,\u201d says co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m, who studies early dinosaur evolution at Uppsala University in Sweden.",
            "Palaeontologists have come up with differing theories for how dinosaurs became the dominant species on Earth. Dinosaurs might have overtaken their rivals because they were particularly able to adapt to a changing ecosystem, for instance, or because random environmental changes favoured them over other species. But there isn\u2019t a single hypothesis that fully explains their rise to dominance.",

            "To better understand dinosaurs\u2019 early evolution, Qvarnstr\u00f6m and his colleagues cut open and examined more than 500 bromalites from the Polish Basin in Central Europe. The fossils are estimated to be around 200 million years old. ",
            "The team used several methods to analyse the bromalites and their contents, including different types of microscope and a technique known as synchrotron microtomography, which uses a particle accelerator to see inside the fossils in detail. The researchers also used chemical solutions to inspect the exact contents of the remains, which included fish, plants and insects.",
            "Despite the age and acidity of many of the fossils, the team found many of the insects the dinosaurs ate to be well preserved. \u201cSome of them were so beautifully preserved in three dimensions and with all the antennae and legs,\u201d says Qvarnstr\u00f6m.",

Researchers are hopeful a strong treaty will emerge from the fifth \u2014 and final \u2014 session of the negotiations, but there is a high chance that any agreement will be weak or delayed. Until a global consensus is reached, however, many cities and nations are introducing their own policies.",
            "\u201cSome countries are pre-emptively protecting themselves, regardless of what happens with the treaty,\u201d says Trisia Farrelly, an environmental anthropologist at New Zealand\u2019s Cawthron Institute in Nelson and a co-lead of the Scientists\u2019 Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, an independent group attending the meeting as an observer. ",
            "These policies showcase what can work, researchers say, but also highlight why a global effort is important. Some groups, including the scientists\u2019 coalition, support a treaty that will reduce production of non-essential plastics, which have skyrocketed to unsustainable levels. But some nations, particularly those that make petrochemicals, want the treaty to focus on waste management instead, including steps such as recycling.",
            " \u201cIf we miss this opportunity to do unified policy-making with standardized guidelines, we\u2019re going to set ourselves back decades or more,\u201d says Douglas McCauley at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who published modelling work on plastics policies earlier this month1.",
            "h2Ban single-use plastics",
            "More than 90 nations and territories have passed full or partial bans on single-use plastic products such as carrier bags. These bans can be very effective. One analysis showed that bans in five US states and cities together cut consumption of single-use plastic bags by about six billion bags per year2. Several studies have also shown huge reductions in plastic litter in waterways, says McCauley. Even fees can work. A litter survey in the United Kingdom found that the number of plastic bags found on beaches dropped by 80% after the nation introduced a mandatory fee for single-use carrier bags, although other forms of litter had increased.",
            "But bans that are poorly designed or enforced are likely to be ineffective. California, for example, allowed shops to switch to thicker, reusable carrier bags \u2014 but people still threw them away, leading to a higher rate of plastic disposal than before. Policies need to be monitored and reviewed, says McCauley. \u201cYou have to put a policy in place, take data and then whack-a-mole the loopholes.\u201d",

            "Clay cylinders unearthed from a tomb in Syria and dated to 4,400 years ago are inscribed with traces of the earliest known alphabetic writing system, an analysis suggests.",
            "The tomb was discovered in Umm el-Marra near Aleppo in 2004 and contained human remains and other objects from the Early Bronze Age (2600\u20132150 bc). The items included four clay cylinders, each about the size of a finger, engraved with eight distinct symbols.",

            "\u201cThese inscriptions might rekindle the idea of the location of where we have the earliest alphabet,\u201d says Chris Dobbs-Allsopp, who studies the Old Testament and Semitic languages at Princeton Theological Seminary in New Jersey.",
            "Archaeologist Glenn Schwartz at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who co-led the excavation and analysed the inscriptions, now suggests that the symbols represent sounds that correspond to a, i, k, l, n, s and y.",
            "The characters do not correspond to a known language, but Schwartz compared them with characters used in West Semitic languages \u2014 including ancient and modern forms of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic \u2014 to decode them. The inscriptions might record people\u2019s names or label objects in the tomb, said Schwartz, who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research in Boston, Massachusetts, on 21 November.",
            "h2Tomb treasures",
            "Archaeologists found the cylinders in one of ten tombs in Umm el-Marra. The burial areas also contained gold jewellery, silver vessels, an ivory comb and pottery. \u201cJudging from their contents, these tombs belonged to people of the highest social rank,\u201d Schwartz said at the meeting.",
            "The cylinders are each one centimetre thick and 4.7 centimetres long, pierced with a small lengthwise hole. In 2021, using radiocarbon dating, Schwartz and his team determined1 that the tubes originate from around 2400 bc. \u201cIt\u2019s 500 years earlier than any other early alphabetic inscription we have. So that\u2019s surprising,\u201d says Dobbs-Allsopp.",
            "Before their discovery, a script from 1900 bc in Egypt was the oldest known alphabetic writing; it turned hieroglyphs into alphabetic letters of West Semitic languages. Hieroglyphs are not considered an alphabet because they mainly use pictures to represent entire words, rather than consisting of a set of letters that each correspond to a sound.",
            "The symbols appear 11 times in total on the cylinders and some are repeated \u2014 evidence that they might be part of an alphabet. Two of the four cylinders seem to have the same sequence, finishing with the same symbol at their unbroken ends. The longer the sequence of symbols, the more likely it is to represent writing rather than comprising non-linguistic symbols, said Schwartz.",
            "Semitic-languages specialist Theodore Lewis at Johns Hopkins, who worked with Schwartz, suggests that one sequence, which can be translated to \u2018sl'nw\u2019, might be the name Sillunu found in texts from the site of Ugarit, an ancient city on the Syrian coast, and derived from a word that means rock.",
            "h2Names or labels",
            "Schwartz suggests that the inscriptions might describe items in the tomb or say to whom they belonged. \u201cIf the Umm el-Marra cylinders were tags or labels, this would be consistent with the association of writing with increasing administrative needs,\u201d he said at the meetings.",
            "The analysis also raises questions about whether the cylinders\u2019 creators were influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs or whether people had developed an alphabet independently in the Levant.",
            "Two characters resemble hieroglyphs, and Schwartz suggests that the people in Umm el-Marra who crafted the cylinders might have had direct contact with Egyptian hieroglyphs through trade.",
            "If the signs are similar to those used in the Egyptian system, \u201cit would be too much coincidence if it was an invention of an alphabetic script totally separately\u201d, says Dobbs-Allsopp.",
            "Schwartz hopes that future studies can uncover the symbols\u2019 meaning and help to solve the mystery of when the first alphabet developed.",

In the past year alone, PsiQuantum, which has 350 staff and is based in Palo Alto, California, has scored major investments from governments in Australia and the United States, adding to previous private funding rounds. \u201cThey have received one of the biggest venture-capital investments in the quantum community,\u201d says Doug Finke, a computer scientist in Orange County, California, who works at the business-analysis firm Global Quantum Intelligence.",

            "PsiQuantum\u2019s approach is radically different to that of some major rivals (see \u2018Comparing quantum computers\u2019 at the end of this article), because of its choice of qubit \u2014 the basic unit of quantum information. Whereas the binary digits (bits) of classical computers encode either a 1 or a 0, qubits can be put into a \u2018superposition\u2019 \u2014 existing in two states at once, a combination of both 1 and 0, with a chance of being measured as either. Calculations come from \u2018entangling\u2019 these qubits, meaning that their quantum states become intrinsically linked and interdependent. To prevent errors from destroying the calculations, a quantum computer will need around 10,000 physical qubits working together to make each useful \u2018logical\u2019 qubit, O\u2019Brien says. With a few hundred of these, researchers hope that quantum computers will be able to perform complex calculations, such as modelling chemical processes at the quantum level, that would be much too difficult for a classical machine.",
            "Many firms in the field make their qubits from atoms, ions or tiny rings of a superconducting material \u2014 in each case, a physical object that has some mass and is often fixed in place. But PsiQuantum is one of a handful of companies that uses massless particles of light, or photons \u2014 sometimes known as flying qubits.",
            "The idea to use light as a qubit isn\u2019t new. In the early 2000s, optical quantum computing was one of the first platforms to be explored experimentally. Some of PsiQuantum\u2019s founders were involved in the field\u2019s birth, says Senellart, who is a co-founder of Quandela, a firm based near Paris that makes photonic quantum computers.",

PsiQuantum creates qubits by using an optical device called a beam splitter to send a single photon simultaneously down two routes (known as waveguides) etched into silicon. Because photons have no charge or mass, they are largely unaffected by their surroundings. This means that, even at room temperature, photon-based qubits are insensitive to many types of noise that plague rival hardware. This ability to maintain quantum information and travel long distances at speed makes it easy to build big and fast systems. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge asset,\u201d says Senellart.",
            "IBM releases first-ever 1,000-qubit quantum chip",
            "But photons also come with hurdles. It is hard to generate single, near-identical photons on demand. They are readily absorbed and lost. And getting the flighty particles to interact is a challenge. Although light waves do interfere with each other, that kind of interaction alone is not sufficient for constructing multi-qubit gates, in which qubits entangle to form basic logic operations.",
            "To generate photons, the firm pumps laser light through silicon. These sources are probabilistic: they produce pairs of photons perhaps once in every 20 attempts. Having a pair is necessary because the spare, or \u2018herald\u2019, photon provides a heads-up that allows the computer to use the surviving photon.",
            "With this strategy, each chip needs many such sources, as well as super-efficient waveguides and optical components that can handle photons without losing them.",
            "To perform logic operations, PsiQuantum first builds up clusters of entangled photon qubits by bringing photons together so that their light waves interfere, then making measurements on some of them in ways that entangle the remaining qubits. Calculations then occur by performing a succession of such measurements on pairs of photons from different clusters. Those measurements destroy the pairs but entangle their clusters, a technique known as fusion-based quantum computing (see \u2018Quantum computers with \u2018flying qubits\u2019\u2019). Senellart says that PsiQuantum has an impressive team working on developing the theory behind such a computer. \u201cThey are coming up with a lot of smart schemes,\u201d she says.",

One Friday night at Radboud University in the Netherlands, Geim poured water into a powerful 16-tesla magnet and found that it levitated.

            "Minetti studies the biomechanics of locomotion and has long had an interest in the forces involved in running. When he learnt that spacecraft orbiting the Moon had detected evidence of water in 2008, he wondered whether a person could run on water on the Moon, which has a gravitational force only about 16% as strong as that of Earth.",
            "Using mathematical models from the basilisk lizard (Basiliscus basiliscus) and the western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), two vertebrates that can run on the surface of water, Minetti calculated that it was theoretically possible. Then, he and his colleagues tested their calculations by attaching a person to a harness to simulate weaker gravity. With the aid of small fins on his feet, a participant was able to stay afloat while running in place in a wading pool, the researchers reported6 in 2012.",
            "The following year, Minetti received a phone call from Abrahams, who offered him an Ig Nobel. At the time, he wasn\u2019t sure of the prize\u2019s standing or what it would do to his reputation, so he conducted a survey among his colleagues. \u201cMost of the people I spoke to were very positive about it,\u201d says Minetti.",

            "Since a schizophrenia drug, the first in decades with an innovative mechanism of action, gained US regulatory approval in September, some researchers have proclaimed a new era for psychiatric medicine. About half a dozen similar drugs \u2014 for schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other conditions involving the brain \u2014 are in various stages of development, most in early-stage clinical trials. But the success of these medicines is not a given. Last week, a trial of a highly anticipated schizophrenia drug reported disappointing results.",
            "For decades, schizophrenia drugs worked in essentially the same way. They blunted the activity of dopamine, a chemical involved in the disorder\u2019s hallmark symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. The new kid on the block is KarXT, sold as Cobenfy. It targets muscarinic receptors and leads to antipsychotic and cognitive benefits. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this much buzz and excitement over a new approach in psychiatry in my career,\u201d says Jeffrey Conn, a pharmacologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.",
            "KarXT\u2019s success in winning US regulatory approval has revived interest in muscarinic drugs. \u201cDrug discovery is coming back to psychiatry,\u201d says Arthur Christopoulos, a molecular pharmacologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who was involved in the development of KarXT.",
            "But developing new medicines is a hard, long road. On 11 November, Abbvie, a pharmaceutical company in North Chicago, Illinois, announced that its muscarinic drug for schizophrenia, called emraclidine, had failed to outperform a placebo. What this means for other muscarinic drugs in development remains to be seen, Christopoulos says. \u201cIt is still early days.\u201d",
            "h2New psychiatric drugs",
            "KarXT\u2019s road to development wasn\u2019t smooth, either. Xanomeline, one of the active components of the drug, was developed in the 1990s and shown to reduce psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But, in a clinical trial1, many participants who received the drug stopped taking it owing to nausea, vomiting and other side effects. Muscarinic receptors are present throughout the brain and body so drugs that target them can have broad effects. The drug was shelved, along with others under development at the time. \u201cAlmost everyone decided that muscarinic agonists were probably an impossible feat to accomplish,\u201d says Conn, who was one of the scientific co-founders of the company behind KarXT.",
            "In 2009, Karuna Therapeutics, based in Boston, Massachusetts, combined xanomeline with another compound, trospium, which blocks muscarinic receptors but cannot cross into the brain, preventing unwanted side effects in the body. The combination became known as KarXT. In clinical trials, people with schizophrenia taking the combined drug experienced antipsychotic and cognitive benefits, with milder side effects than for xanomeline on its own.",
            "h2Mode of action",
            "Xanomeline acts mostly on two of the five muscarinic receptors: the M1 and M4 receptors. Animal studies suggest that the M4 receptor is most strongly associated with antipsychotic effects, whereas the M1 receptor is linked to cognition.",

            "In the two weeks since the US presidential election, the platform has grown from close to 14 million users to nearly 21 million. Bluesky has broad appeal in large part because it looks and feels a lot like X (formerly known as Twitter), which became hugely popular with scientists, who used it to share research findings, collaborate and network. One estimate suggests that at least half a million researchers had Twitter profiles in 2022.",
            "That was the year that billionaire Elon Musk bought the platform. He renamed it X and reduced content moderation, among other changes, prompting some researchers to leave. Since then, pornography, spam, bots and abusive content have increased on X, and community protections have decreased, say researchers.",

            "Bluesky, by contrast, offers users control over the content they see and the people they engage with, through moderation and protections such as blocking and muting features, say researchers. It is also built on an open network, which gives researchers and developers access to its data; X now charges a hefty fee for this kind of access.",

Still, white individuals currently represent 90% of Brazilian scientists \u2014 a proportion 12 times higher than that of Black, mixed-heritage and Indigenous individuals combined, according to a study by researchers at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThese groups are minorities in almost all fields of the hard sciences,\u201d says co-author Marcia Rangel Candido.",
            "To try to correct these inequalities and promote equity in historically marginalized minority groups, graduate programmes first began to implement affirmative-action policies in the 2000s, some on their own initiative and others as a requirement under state laws and university resolutions. The movement gained traction in 2016, when the government started to require federal higher-education institutions to submit proposed measures for including Black, mixed-race, Indigenous and disabled people in their graduate programmes.",
