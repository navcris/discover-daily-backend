            "\n Hold the morning coffee and meditation: for about 75 days over the span of a year, neuroscientist Carina Heller\u2019s morning ritual included climbing into her university\u2019s brain scanner at 7:30 a.m. and lying perfectly still for an hour and a half \u2014 without falling asleep. By her estimates, this has made her the most-scanned woman in science.\n",
            "\n It\u2019s not the title she was after. Heller\u2019s goal was to catalogue how her brain changes during her menstrual cycle, with and without \n \n  oral contraceptives\n . Her findings suggest that brain morphology and connectivity change daily throughout the natural cycle and are influenced by birth-control pills, according to preliminary results presented at this year\u2019s annual Society for Neuroscience conference.\n",
            "\n Heller is one of a cadre of women\u2019s health researchers who are tired of waiting for data to trickle in on a \n \n  chronically understudied\n  area, and have taken matters into their own hands by hopping into a brain-imaging machine. More data could offer women and their physicians greater agency to make \u201cbetter-informed decisions of whether they want to take the medication or not\u201d, and what specific formulations might be best suited for them, says Heller, who is based at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in Minneapolis.\n",
            "\n \u201cShe did this rigorous self-experimentation where she gave herself up to science,\u201d says Emily Jacobs, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who works with Heller. \u201cAnd as a result, we now have this greater insight into the human brain.\u201d\n",

            "\n Oral contraceptives often contain synthetic versions of one or two hormones the body naturally produces: progesterone and oestrogen. These hormones prevent pregnancy in several ways, including by stopping the ovaries from releasing an egg.\n",
            "\n US regulators approved the first oral contraceptive in 1960. Within two years, more than one million people were taking \u2018the pill\u2019, as it became known. Today, more than 150 million people of reproductive age globally take oral contraceptives, placing them among the most-used medications in the world. Many take the pill for reasons unrelated to conception, such as managing acne, regulating menstrual cycles or helping to relieve menstrual symptoms and migraines.\n",
            "\n Decades of data on these medicines suggest that they are generally safe, but their effects on the brain remain understudied. For example, although some people report that they experience decreased depression and anxiety, others find that these symptoms worsen \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear why.\n",
            "\n Many people begin taking the pill during puberty, which is a crucial time for brain maturation, so it\u2019s important to understand how it affects neurodevelopment, says Kathryn Lenz, a behavioural neuroscientist at The Ohio State University in Columbus.\n",
            "h2\n The adaptable brain\n",
            "\n Most neuroimaging experiments use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to scan the brains of 10\u201330 participants only once or twice, which is costly to perform. This approach fails to account for daily variation in brain morphology and connectivity.\n",
            "\n A growing number of neuroimaging studies instead use a technique called \u2018\n \n  dense sampling\n \u2019, in which researchers scan a single or handful of participants repeatedly to build a high-resolution data set. Dense sampling captures observations that might otherwise be overlooked, but the small sample size results in limited generalizability of findings to larger populations.\n",
            "\n Even so, by comparing data sets between participants \u2014 especially those who have different reactions to the pill \u2014 researchers might be able to pinpoint what drives different side effects.\n",

            "\n Using this approach, Heller scanned herself 25 times over 5 weeks, capturing images at different stages of her natural menstrual cycle. A few months later, she began taking oral contraceptives and then waited 3 months before scanning herself another 25 times in 5 weeks. At that point, Heller ceased taking the pill, waited another 3 months and scanned herself a final 25 times over 5 weeks. She also had blood drawn and completed a survey about her mood after each scan.\n",
            "\n Heller found a rhythmic pattern of change in brain volume and connectivity between brain regions over the course of her menstrual cycle, with volume and connectivity dipping slightly while she was taking oral contraceptives. (Higher brain volume or connectivity does not imply improved brain function, and vice versa.)\n",
            "\n This pattern largely returned to its former state after she stopped taking the medication, showing that the brain is \u201cquite adaptable\u201d, says Laura Pritschet, who conducted her graduate work with Jacobs and is now a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\n",
            "h2\n An expanding network\n",
            "\n Heller drew inspiration from a study in which Pritschet scanned her own brain for 30 consecutive days during her natural menstrual cycle and for 30 more days while taking oral contraceptives. This was part of a project that Pritschet calls 28andMe: the name is a nod to the consumer-genetics firm 23andMe in South San Francisco, California, and the 28 days in a canonical menstrual cycle.\n",
            "\n Data from Pritschet\u2019s project showed that higher levels of oestrogen drive certain important brain networks to become more functionally connected\n \n\n   1\n  \n. One of these was the \u2018default mode network\u2019, which is active during daydreaming and is involved in memory. Progesterone had the opposite effect. Pritschet also scanned her husband over 30 consecutive days in a spin-off project called 28andHe, to understand the effects of hormone fluctuations in the male brain\n \n\n   2\n  \n.\n",
            "\n Next, Heller plans to compare her data with those from a woman with endometriosis, a painful condition that affects up to 10% of women at reproductive age, to understand whether hormone fluctuations in the brain could be driving the condition.\n",
            "\n These data sets are \u201cgoing to give us a really intriguing window into the relationship between hormonal status and subtle changes in brain structure and behavioural functions\u201d, Lenz says.\n",

            "\n China is now home to the world\u2019s most powerful resistive magnet, which produced a magnetic field that was more than 800,000 times stronger than Earth\u2019s.\n",
            "\n On 22 September, the magnet, at the Steady High Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) at the Chinese Academy of Science\u2019s Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, sustained a steady magnetic field of 42.02 tesla. This milestone narrowly surpasses the 41.4-tesla record set in 2017 by a resistive magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida. Resistive magnets are made of coiled metal wires and are widely used in magnet facilities across the world.\n",
            "\n China\u2019s record-breaker lays the groundwork for building reliable magnets that can sustain ever-stronger magnetic fields, which would help researchers to discover surprising new physics, says Joachim Wosnitza, a physicist at the Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Germany.\n",
            "\n The resistive magnet \u2014 which is open to international users \u2014 is the country\u2019s second major contribution to the global quest to produce ever-higher magnetic fields. In 2022, the SHMFF\u2019s hybrid magnet, which combines a resistive magnet with a superconducting one, produced a field of 45.22 tesla, making it the most powerful working steady-state magnet in the world.\n",
            "h2\n Research tool\n",
            "\n High-field magnets are handy tools for uncovering hidden properties of advanced materials, such as \n \n  superconductors\n  \u2014 materials that, under very low temperatures, carry electric current without producing waste heat. High fields also offer the chance to glimpse entirely new physical phenomena, says Marc-Henri Julien, a condensed-matter physicist at the National Laboratory for Intense Magnetic Fields in Grenoble, France. \u201cYou can create or manipulate new states of matter,\u201d says Julien.\n",
            "\n High fields are also useful for experiments that rely on very sensitive measurements, because they boost the resolution and make it easier to see faint phenomena, says Alexander Eaton, a condensed-matter physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK. \u201cEvery extra tesla is exponentially better than the last,\u201d he says.\n",
            "\n Guangli Kuang, a physicist who specializes in high magnetic fields at the SHMFF, says the team spent years modifying the magnet to hit the latest record. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to achieve,\u201d he says.\n",
            "h2\n Reliable but costly\n",
            "\n Resistive magnets are an older technology, but they can sustain high magnetic fields for longer periods than can their newer hybrid and fully superconducting counterparts, says Wosnitza. Their magnetic fields can also be ramped up much quicker, making them versatile experimental tools. \u201cYou can just twist a knob and go from zero tesla to high fields within minutes,\u201d he says.\n",
            "\n The big drawback of resistive magnets is the amount of power they consume, making them costly, says Eaton. For instance, the SHMFF\u2019s resistive magnet drew 32.3 megawatts of electricity to produce its record-breaking field. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a very good science case to justify that resource,\u201d says Eaton.\n",
            "\n That challenge is driving the race to develop hybrid and fully superconducting magnets that can generate high fields using less power. In 2019, NHMFL researchers built a miniature, proof-of-concept superconducting magnet that briefly sustained \n \n  a 45.5-tesla field\n , and are currently developing a larger 40-tesla superconducting magnet that can be used for experiments. The team at the SHMFF is building a 55-tesla hybrid one. Although these newer magnets are expected to be cheaper to run than their resistive counterparts, they come with their own hurdles: they are more expensive to build and require complicated cooling systems, says engineer Mark Bird, a co-leader of the NHMFL\u2019s magnet science and technology division. \u201cThe technology is still being developed, and the costs are not clear yet,\u201d says Bird.\n",

In this scenario, group agreement on several contentious topics increased after interacting with the AI.

            "\n Scientists have designed a new form of insulin that can automatically switch itself on and off depending on glucose levels in the blood. In animals, this \u2018smart\u2019 insulin\n \n\n   1\n  \n reduced high blood-sugar concentrations effectively while preventing levels from dropping too low.\n",
            "\n For people with \n \n  diabetes\n , controlling blood-sugar levels is a crucial \u2014 but demanding \u2014 task. Insulin keeps blood glucose in check, helping to prevent the many long-term complications associated with high blood sugar, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke and blindness. A large proportion of the estimated 422 million people with diabetes worldwide require insulin injections.\n",
            "\n But excess \n \n  insulin\n  can cause blood-sugar levels to dip too low, a condition called hypoglycaemia, putting people at risk of serious complications, such as loss of consciousness, seizures and even death. Even mild or moderate hypoglycaemia can cause anxiety, weakness and confusion. People with diabetes \u2014 particularly those with \n \n  type 1 diabetes\n , who always need to inject insulin \u2014 can have drops in blood-glucose concentrations several times a week, says Michael Weiss, a biochemist and physician at Indiana University in Indianapolis. \u201cIt really impairs quality of life.\u201d\n",
            "\n For decades, researchers have been working to develop a system that can automatically adjust insulin activity based on the amount of glucose in a person\u2019s blood. One common approach has been to make a compound containing deposits that release insulin when glucose concentrations rise. But a key disadvantage of this method is its irreversibility \u2014 once insulin is released, it can\u2019t be reined in.\n",
            "h2\n A sugar-sensitive switch\n",
            "\n The latest study, published today in \n \n  Nature\n , gets around this issue by modifying insulin itself using glucose-sensitive components. Rita Slaaby, a principal scientist at pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, and her colleagues engineered an insulin molecule with a switch that turns its activity on and off in response to glucose levels in the blood. This switch consists of two parts: a ring-shaped structure known as a macrocycle and a glucoside, a molecule derived from glucose. When blood-glucose concentrations are low, the glucoside binds to the ring, keeping the insulin in a closed, inactive state. But when glucose levels in the blood rise, the sugar displaces the glucoside and changes the shape of the insulin so that it is turned on.\n",
            "\n The researchers tested the insulin molecule, which they named NNC2215, in pigs and rats that had received infusions of glucose to mimic the effects of diabetes. They found that NNC2215 was as good as normal human insulin at lowering blood glucose when injected into the animals \u2014 and that it was able to prevent the drop in blood-glucose levels that occurred with a current insulin treatment. \u201cThis a very good study that was well designed \u2014 they did all the necessary experiments to validate that this works,\u201d says David Sacks, a clinical chemist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cIt certainly provides encouragement that this approach is worth pursuing.\u201d\n",
            "\n The modified insulin is the first shown to target glucose, says Sacks. Weiss and his colleagues have previously demonstrated that an insulin molecule with a similar kind of molecular switch was sensitive to another sugar molecule, fructose\n \n\n   2\n  \n.\n",
            "\n A few questions remain about the latest molecule. For one, the study looked at the activity of NNC2215 in a wider range of blood-glucose levels than is typically seen in people with diabetes, so future studies should demonstrate that the insulin can also be effective in a narrow range, Sacks says. Other considerations include the safety and price tag of this molecule, notes Zhen Gu, a biomedical engineer at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. (Gu\u2019s team is also designing a glucose-sensitive insulin molecule\n \n\n   3\n  \n.)\n",
            "\n A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk says that although this study is a proof of principle of NNC2215\u2019s glucose-sensitive insulin properties, further research to optimize the molecule is ongoing.\n",
            "\n Several other smart insulin drugs are in the works, says Weiss, including one his own team is designing using a similar approach. Ultimately, the goal is to generate a suite of smart insulin drugs to enable doctors to individualize therapies for their patients, he adds.\n",

            "\n The protein-design contests are partly inspired by a 30-year-old competition that helped to kick off the revolution in biological AI. Since 1994, the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) has been challenging scientists to predict the 3D shape of proteins from their amino-acid sequences. Winners of the competition \u2014 founded by computational biologist John Moult at the University of Maryland in Rockville and Krzysztof Fidelis, a computational biologist at the University of California, Davis \u2014 are determined by comparing the computational predictions with unpublished structural models.\n",

Its next iteration, AlphaFold 2, \n \n  performed so well in 2020\n  that Moult declared the problem of predicting simple protein structures largely solved. The competition has since shifted its focus to other emerging challenges, such as predicting the structure of multiple interacting proteins in a complex.\n",

            "\n In June, Rost and several of his colleagues won the Protein Engineering Tournament run by Align to Innovate, an international, open-science non-profit organization. The event included two parts. First, participants tried to predict the properties of different enzyme variants. The best-performing teams in this round then re-engineered an enzyme that breaks down starch, with the best designs determined by lab experiments. A 2025 tournament is now in the works.\n",

            "\n The competitions could prove counterproductive if they send the field down a rabbit hole \u2014 for example, by judging designs too narrowly, warns Rost. Researchers could also fail to reap the full benefits of protein-design competitions \n \n  if contestants keep quiet about their approaches\n , says Anthony Gitter, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \u201cIf teams aren\u2019t communicating their methods, there\u2019s not much opportunity to learn about what work and what fails.\u201d\n",
            "\n So far, this doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. Most of the competitions encourage or even require participants to describe their approaches. The contests could also help to bring together some of the disparate fields that have been drawn to protein design \u2014 from biochemistry labs that pioneered protein engineering methods to machine-learning scientists who cut their teeth in natural-language processing, says Gitter. \u201cPeople organizing the competitions, to have maximum impact on the field, should think really hard about how to create a community.\u201d\n",
            "\n When the Adaptyv competition results were announced in late September, Naka was disappointed. Although all ten of his entries looked strong, none of his designs worked in the lab. Only 5 of the 147 designs that were tested actually bound to the target molecule. And more than 50 of them couldn\u2019t even be made.\n",
            "\n That actually isn\u2019t bad: past efforts to design EGFR binders have had much lower success rates. \u201cIt\u2019s par for the course in protein engineering \u2014 you have to be ready to fail a lot,\u201d Naka says. The winners were Martin Pacesa and Lennart Nickel, structural biologists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, who posted a preprint describing their approach and made its code open-source (\n \n  M. Pacesa \n  \n   et al\n  . Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/nmfm; 2024\n ). Adaptyv has now \n \n  launched a second competition\n  that builds on the first.\n",
            "\n Naka wishes he had started working on his entries earlier. He describes his hackathon as \u201ctype 2 fun\u201d \u2014 painful at the time, but enjoyable in retrospect.

            "\n In a paper published in January, Zhan and his team demonstrated that these neurons were activated in mice in response to fasting, and that they caused T cells to retreat from the blood, spleen and lymph nodes to their central reservoir, the bone marrow\n \n\n   4\n  \n. Zhan also used a mouse model of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis to show that the continuous activation of these neurons significantly alleviated paralysis, prevented disease-related weight loss and increased survival.\n",

            "\n Although evidence supporting fasting as a therapy has grown in the past decade or so, cutting back on calories could have detrimental effects in some circumstances. For example, it could blunt immune responses. In a study published last year, Filip Swirski, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and his colleagues recorded a 90% reduction in monocytes circulating in the blood of fasting mice, and an increase in these cells in the bone marrow, where they are produced\n \n\n   5\n  \n.\n",
            "\n When the mice were fed after fasting for 24 hours, the monocytes flooded back into the blood in unusually large numbers, causing monocytosis, a condition usually associated with infectious and autoimmune disease. These post-fasting monocytes also lived longer than normal and had a lower-than-usual threshold for triggering inflammation. When the researchers infected the mice that had fasted with \n \n  Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n , a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, the animals died sooner and in larger numbers than did non-fasted controls.\n",
            "\n\n\n\n\n    Common sweetener suppresses mouse immune system \u2014 in high doses\n   \n\n\n",
            "\n Swirski thinks that the body preserves its stock of monocytes as a protective mechanism while energy reserves are low. However, if fasting is prolonged, the costs can outweigh the benefits.\n",
            "\n Further work is needed to understand the implications of the study in humans, but Swirski says it might warn against excessive or lengthy fasting. \u201cThere is plenty of evidence that fasting can be beneficial, but sometimes it\u2019s about finding a balance and not pushing your system to extremes.\u201d Swirski himself tends to skip lunch, \u201cbut I would not want to fast excessively\u201d, he says.\n",
            "\n Fasting redistributes immune cells within hours. And other changes in diet can prompt similarly rapid, short-lived changes to immunity. Studying those changes is helpful for researchers, in part because it helps them to avoid the confounding factors that can undermine research into long-term dietary changes, says Siracusa. He has studied the impact of \u2018feast diets\u2019 \u2014 the tendency to overindulge in energy-dense, high-fat foods.\n",
            "\n Siracusa and colleagues fed mice an \u2018indulgent\u2019 low-fibre, high-fat diet for three days, then a normal diet for three days, before repeating the cycle. The switch to the high-fat diet suppressed immunity and made mice more susceptible to bacterial infection\n \n\n   6\n  \n. It reduced the number and undermined the function of certain T cells that help the body to detect and memorize pathogens; further tests showed that the lack of fibre impaired the gut microbiome, which usually supports these T cells. \u201cI was surprised that changing the diet for just three days was enough time to see these dramatic effects on adaptive immune-system cells,\u201d adds Siracusa.\n",
            "\n When Siracusa asked six human volunteers to switch from a high-fibre to low-fibre diet, he saw similar effects on their T cells. The effects \u2014 as with any holiday feast \u2014 were transient, but Siracusa thinks that looking at these early immune events relating to changes in diet could reveal insights into the causes of chronic immune conditions. However, he emphasizes that he would not make dietary recommendations on the basis of this small proof-of-principle experiment. Furthermore, work in mice can provide only clues as to what happens in humans.\n",
            "h2\n\n  Human trials\n \n",
            "\n Confirming those clues in people can be difficult. Precisely controlling what study participants eat over long periods is challenging, as is getting them to accurately recall and record their diets each day. \u201cOne approach is to ask people to just eat the food you provide for them,\u201d says integrative physiologist Kevin Hall at the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cHowever, we know that when you do so, they consume 400 calories of off-study food on average.\u201d\n",

            "\n Hall and Belkaid, who is now president of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, enlisted 20 adults for a four-week hospital stay and randomized them to follow either a ketogenic diet (one based on animal products and with low levels of carbohydrate) or a vegan, low-fat diet for the first two weeks, then the alternate diet for the final two weeks. Blood samples showed that shifting to either diet was linked to clear changes in both the numbers of different immune cells and which genes were being activated in them\n \n\n   7\n  \n.\n",
            "\n While on the ketogenic diet, participants had enhanced levels and activity of T and B cells that form part of the adaptive immune system, which mounts a \u2018precision\u2019 response that recognizes specific foes. Those on the vegan diet saw enhanced innate immune responses, which are quicker and less specific than adaptive responses. Belkaid was delighted to see such clear results and is excited at their clinical potential, but refuses to offer dietary advice on the basis of them at this stage. Yet, despite differences in age, genetics and body weight, she says, \u201cit was surprising to see how convergent the immune-system effects were\u201d in just two weeks. \u201cThe next step is to test dietary interventions for specific conditions in clinical trials that are as rigorous as those we do for drugs,\u201d she says.\n",
            "\n Hall\u2019s group is considering including people with lupus in a study, to compare the effects of different diets. Others have done preliminary studies on the use of ketogenic diets as add-on therapies for psoriasis\n \n\n   8\n  \n and type 1 diabetes\n \n\n   9\n  \n. There has also been a substantial increase in research into the use of diet and nutrition to boost the effects of therapies that co-opt the immune system to target cancer\n \n\n   10\n  \n. One study, published in 2021, found that higher dietary-fibre consumption was associated with improved survival in people receiving an immunotherapy for melanoma, and that mice with melanomas and that were fed a low-fibre diet had fewer killer T cells \u2014 which attack cancer cells \u2014 near their tumours\n \n\n   11\n  \n.\n",
            "\n Belkaid acknowledges there is still much more work to do to unpick the effects of specific diets on the immune systems of those with different health conditions. However, she and Siracusa are among a growing group of immunologists who are optimistic that the mechanistic insights they and others are uncovering are the first steps towards personalized diets for a range of medical conditions. \u201cI can imagine a world, in the next 10 years, in which we have access to rigorous dietary advice that can be applied in a range of clinical settings,\u201d she says. \u201cI think highly informed nutrition has enormous clinical potential.\u201d\n",

Last year, for example, a study of 150 people found that tDCS did not have antidepressant effects\n \n\n   2\n  \n. But trials with positive and negative outcomes are both equally important to investigate the method\u2019s potential as a treatment for depression, says Frank Padberg, a psychiatrist at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany.

            "\n \u201cThree decades ago, I wouldn't have thought that this stimulation does anything on the brain,\u201d says Padberg. But now it is known that tDCS affects brain activity, \u201cI'm pretty sure that an optimized method will make it to clinical care one day,\u201d he says.\n",

            "\n To test the reliability of their work, the researchers checked their genome predictions against a genome database corresponding with the cells they used. They were able to link most of the data sets to their corresponding genome, with an accuracy rate of more than 80%.\n",
            "\n Unlike the data on gene expression and eQTLs, full-genome databases can usually be accessed only by scientists, to protect donor\u2019s identifying information. But the researchers point out that a participant\u2019s genome data can be publicly available elsewhere. For example, they might have uploaded it to a genealogy website in which users send DNA samples to learn more about their ancestry. In this case, an attacker could identify an individual whose cells are in a single-cell data set using their genome. This could reveal personal data related to a sensitive trait such as a psychiatric disorder, given that research participants are often selected to study the biology of these complex conditions.\n",
            "\n Privacy breaches such as these could have real-world implications, including causing employment discrimination, says G\u00fcrsoy. She adds that any leaks could even have repercussions for future generations, given that genetic traits can be passed to offspring. \u201cAnything that leaks about us will perpetuate through generations,\u201d she says.\n",
            "\n Bradley Malin, who researches large-scale genomic data sharing at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, says that the study is a \u201cnovel extension and contribution to the literature\u201d. He adds that future research could explore whether genomic data could still be linked in larger data sets that include samples from thousands or millions of people.\n",

            "\n Scientists are unsure about how best to tackle these privacy concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s the desire to protect individual privacy, but also the desire to collectively advance medical research, and those are, unfortunately, at odds with each other,\u201d says Mark Gerstein, who researches medical data science at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The simplest solution would be to stop making genetic data so easily accessible, but this would negatively affect research, he says. \u201cWe need to share and aggregate large amounts of information.\u201d he says. \u201cLocking it down and making it more private, really, just gums that whole process up.\u201d\n",
            "\n In their study, G\u00fcrsoy and her colleagues say that there should be greater transparency about the risks for participants who share their genomic data, and suggest that researchers should ensure that donors give consent for their data being shared. Another way forward could be encrypting personal data when it is part of a public database. The authors acknowledge that doing this would complicate the process of building and maintaining data sets, but say that it could help to protect participants\u2019 privacy.\n",
