            "Over the past five years, the nation has won more scientific Nobel prizes than the rest of the world combined \u2014 in line with its domination of the prizes since the middle of the twentieth century. In 2020, two US drug companies spearheaded the development of vaccines that helped to contain a pandemic. Two years later, a California start-up firm released the revolutionary artificial-intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT and a national laboratory broke a fundamental barrier in nuclear fusion.",
            "This year, the United States is on track to spend US$1 trillion on research and development (R&D), much more than any other country. And its labs are a magnet for researchers from around the globe, with workers born in other nations accounting for 43% of doctorate-holders in the US workforce in science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM).",

            "But as voters go to the polls in November to elect a new president and Congress, some scientific leaders worry that the nation is ceding ground to other research powerhouses, notably China, which is already outpacing the United States on many of the leading science metrics. \u201cUS science is perceived to be \u2014 and is \u2014 losing the race for global STEM leadership,\u201d said Marcia McNutt, president of the US National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC, in a speech in June.",
            "Concerns range from funding limitations for R&D and the growing politicization of science to heated debates about immigration. This has created \u201ca perception that the United States is increasingly hostile to foreigners\u201d, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) reported in August1, warning that the United States \u201ccan no longer take for granted that it will remain the destination of choice for the world\u2019s best and brightest\u201d. The academies called for a government-wide effort to attract and retain international talent and improve STEM education at home.",
            "The future of US science hinges, in no small way, on the November election. Together, the next president and Congress will play a pivotal part in setting the course for the US scientific enterprise for years to come by establishing funding plans, immigration policies and national-security measures that affect international collaboration.",

            "The driving force behind research is money, and the United States has long enjoyed a leading position in science and technology in large part because it outspends all other nations. Combining government and private funding, the United States spent $923 billion in 2022 (the last year for which full numbers are available), or around 30% of global R&D spending.",
            "But as China\u2019s economy has soared, so has its R&D spending, to the equivalent of $812 billion (adjusted for purchasing power parity). On that trajectory it will draw level with the United States before 2030 (see \u2018Research funding race\u2019).",

In 2016, China leaped ahead as the top producer of science and engineering articles. In 2019, it passed the United States in the number of science and engineering PhDs awarded; and in 2021, it became top dog in international patent applications, according to a report by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) published in March2.",
            "For years, some researchers who study science metrics have argued that China still lagged behind in terms of the quality of its scientific output, but that is also changing. In 2020, for instance, China overtook the United States in terms of its share of the world\u2019s top 1% cited papers, a proxy measure of high-impact work, according to numbers from the Web of Science database (see \u2018Top-cited research\u2019).",

Adjusting for this bias dents China\u2019s progress \u2014 perhaps nudging it down to fourth in the world, the study suggested \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t hugely change its direction of travel.",

            "Does it matter whether China or the United States is on top? Some political rhetoric frames these trends as essentially a zero-sum game. But in research, one country\u2019s gain is not necessarily another\u2019s loss, says Caroline Wagner, a research-policy specialist at the Ohio State University in Columbus.",
            "The highest-cited papers of all come from US, Chinese and European researchers working together, she says. If China, or any other country, is pouring more money into research, this should benefit the United States \u2014 as long as it retains world-leading scientists who can tap into global innovation, and keeps its own research funding and quality high, says Kieron Flanagan, a research-policy analyst at the University of Manchester, UK.",
            "h2Missing in action: federal funds",
            "The current alarms about US science echo similar warnings that have rippled through policy circles about once a generation. In 2005, for example, the National Academies published a dire report called Rising Above the Gathering Storm that cautioned about threats to US competitiveness from globalization4.",
            "How Trump damaged science \u2014 and why it could take decades to recover",
            "One recommendation from the report was to double the amount of basic research funding for mathematics, engineering and physical sciences, in line with the doubling of the budget for the National Institutes of Health that was accomplished between 1998 and 2003. The US Congress, which sets funding levels, passed a law in 2007 promising to do just that \u2014 but lawmakers didn\u2019t follow through.",
            "History is now repeating itself. In 2022, this time with an eye on China, Congress united to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized $280 billion to promote the domestic semiconductor industry and boost the budgets of several major research agencies. A key beneficiary of the legislation, the NSF, saw its budget increase by 11% to $9.9 billion in 2023 \u2014 only to fall back to $9.1 billion when Congress finalized this year\u2019s budget.",
            "As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), public investments in the NSF, the US Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science and the US National Institutes of Standards and Technology \u2014 all major funders of basic research in the physical sciences \u2014 are now lower than they have been at any time since 1997, according to Matt Hourihan, associate vice-president for government relations and public policy at the Association of American Universities in Washington DC (see \u2018Falling federal research intensity\u2019). US research investment as a share of GDP is still rising \u2014 but that is because R&D investment from private businesses is picking up the slack.",

The sharp uptick in private R&D is good for jobs and the economy, but it is no substitute for the kind of basic science that federal investments support, she told Nature.",
            "Indeed, these trends explain the shifting balance of power between the United States and China, says Jonathan Adams, chief scientist at the Institute of Scientific Information, a unit of the analytics firm Clarivate, who is based in London. Adams points out that the United States retains its lead in areas that it has invested in the most, such as biomedical research. By contrast, China is overtaking the United States in materials science, physical sciences and computer science, which are areas where US investments have fallen short.",
            "The question, come January, is whether the next president and Congress will work together to advance scientific funding commitments that both political parties have endorsed in the past. This depends in large part on who controls the two chambers of Congress, which is currently divided, with Democrats holding the Senate and Republicans having a majority in the House of Representatives.",
            "Biden seeks to boost science funding \u2014 but his budget faces an ominous future",
            "When it comes to setting spending priorities, Congress often goes its own way no matter what presidents propose in their budgets. For example, although previous president Donald Trump repeatedly sought to cut science budgets, it was during his tenure that Congress broke its own self-imposed budget caps and gave science agencies a significant boost in funding alongside the increases in defence spending sought by the Trump administration, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland.",
            "Today, lawmakers are once again operating under a budget agreement that seeks to cap overall spending until 2025, which could make it difficult to increase STEM spending, but it\u2019s unclear how that discussion will play out with a new president and Congress next year.",
            "\u201cI call it the whiplash effect,\u201d says Zeitzer. Funding agencies are constantly buffeted by shifting political winds that produce big promises \u2014 and occasionally big investments \u2014 before an inevitable swing back towards austerity. Half of the time, funding agencies are operating under provisional budgets and the looming threat of a government shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re supposed to be competitive if we\u2019re facing another 20 years of this,\u201d Zeitzer says.",
            "h2The importance of foreign talent",
            "Because the United States relies heavily on international talent to fuel its scientific engine, a key question is whether it will remain the preferred place for researchers globally to study and work. There are different ways to interpret the data.",
            "The United States relies ever more heavily on overseas researchers: more than one-third of science and engineering PhDs granted last year went to international students (those on temporary visas), with the share at 59% in computer science (see \u2018US reliance on overseas talent\u2019). \u201cWe are at an all-time high in terms of dependency on foreign talent,\u201d says Dar\u00edo Gil, director of research at the technology giant IBM in Yorktown Heights, New York, and current chair of the US National Science Board, which oversees the NSF.",

            "Most of these students come from China and India, which is a distant second. And when asked, 77% of Chinese students who earned doctoral degrees in the United States said that they intended to stay in the country, according to 2022 data, a proportion that has dipped only slightly over the previous five years.",
            "More generally, the United States remains the world\u2019s top venue for international students, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development5, hosting 15% of all students worldwide in 2020, the latest comparative figures available.",
            "But there are signs that the United States might be losing its edge. Its share of international students is declining, down from 23% in 20005. And although enrolment numbers have recovered to an all-time high after a brief pandemic dip (see \u2018International students on the rebound\u2019), there remains a question about whether top talent from China continues to view the United States as an attractive destination.",

            "Some lawmakers in Congress might welcome this trend. Citing the dangers of letting science that is funded by US taxpayers fall into the hands of the Chinese military, congressional Republicans are pushing legislation that would limit the kind of research collaborations that university researchers can pursue.",
            "Questions about immigration and research security came to a head when Trump occupied the White House. First came the temporary travel ban that mainly impacted citizens from several Muslim-majority countries. Then a federal crackdown on academic espionage, dubbed the China Initiative, drew accusations of racism after ensnaring scholars with links to China, including many US citizens of Chinese descent.",
            "Biden ultimately ended both policies, but many scholars say they could make a comeback if Trump prevails in November. Last month, Trump vowed to reinstate his travel ban, and Republicans who control the US House of Representatives have approved legislation that would, if enacted, essentially reinstate the China Initiative.",
            "These tensions might be taking a toll: surveys in the United States have found that many Chinese researchers worry about prejudice after the China Initiative. A study6 published this year examined the propensity of Chinese students to enrol in US PhD programmes, compared with a control group of non-Chinese students. The two were in step until 2016, but the Chinese students became 15% less likely to enrol by 2019 \u2014 and more likely to enrol in non-US English-speaking countries. (The rapid drop of enrolments during the pandemic means that the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, can\u2019t reliably be extended to later years.)",
            "Although Chinese-student enrolment at US universities has rebounded since the pandemic, China\u2019s best and brightest might be shying away, says Yingyi Ma, a sociologist who heads the Asian/Asian American studies programme at Syracuse University in New York. Soaring anti-China rhetoric probably plays a part, Ma says, but so do expanding opportunities for Chinese graduate students at home, and the growing challenges to obtain work visas.",

The Biden administration has been working to do just that under existing laws and regulations, she says, but it\u2019s ultimately up to Congress to increase the numbers of green cards that are available. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that Congress could do to solve this problem,\u201d Nice says.",
            "Not everybody is convinced that US academic institutions are facing an imminent crisis when it comes to international talent. Allan Goodman, chief executive at the Institute of International Education in New York City, points out that the United States isn\u2019t the only country that is cracking down on immigration: Canada, the United Kingdom and others are doing much the same. This means fewer non-US options as international students consider where to forge their careers.",
            "Gil also says that he doesn\u2019t see evidence showing Chinese students have been put off coming to the United States. \u201cThere is an extraordinary appetite to continue to come to the US,\u201d he says. Gil says a bigger problem is how to encourage US students to engage in science and technology, citing declining mathematics attainment scores.",
            "h2The campus culture wars",
            "Across university campuses in the United States, there are growing tensions over issues such as the Gaza\u2013Israel war; efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion; and the rights of transgender individuals. Part of a broader trend towards increasing political polarization, these culture wars have engulfed campuses and led some lawmakers to impose limits on what university researchers can study and teach, and to curtail policies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion. The August NASEM report1 tapped into some of these sentiments, raising the fear that the United States\u2019 reputation is beginning to suffer abroad. \u201cSome of the nation\u2019s most important advantages in attracting and retaining talent are the intangibles: values, freedom, and opportunity,\u201d the report stated.",
            "Like Biden, vice-president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris would be expected to advance science-friendly budgets while continuing to emphasize the role of science in tackling climate change and promoting public health. By contrast, Trump and his appointees repeatedly undermined government scientists and agencies during his time in office, especially on issues such as climate change and public health.",
            "Many political scientists fear a second Trump term could be even more fraught for government researchers. Besides Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the results of any election he doesn\u2019t win and his promises to use the powers of the federal government for political retribution, researchers fear that he just might succeed in reshaping the US government by replacing thousands of federal scientists with obedient political appointees. This would further undermine the part that science plays in developing the rules and regulations that govern everything from greenhouse-gas emissions to drug development.",

To retrieve the data, the researchers use a DNA-sequencing technique that can detect the methyl groups along the DNA strand.

A paper categorized as \u2018high risk\u2019 might have multiple authors whose other studies have been retracted for reasons related to misconduct, for example. Having a high score doesn\u2019t prove that a paper is low quality, but suggests that it is worth investigating.",

That\u2019s not surprising, because Wiley has retracted more than 10,000 Hindawi-published papers over the past two years in response to concerns raised by editors and sleuths; this amounts to more than 4% of the brand\u2019s total portfolio over the past decade.

For animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature, called ectotherms, the difference is smaller. For the pampas snake (Tomodon dorsatus), for example, the value is around four times more. And for a species of seawater fish called the capelin (Mallotus villosus), it is twice more.",

And these, in turn, feed into explanations of why species evolve in the way that they do, such as the number of offspring that they have, or the benefits of live births over laying eggs.",

It is akin to assuming that the energy needed to make a doughnut is equal to the calories in the doughnut itself, and ignoring the fuel required to cook it.",

            "In 2020, Marshall\u2019s team decided to comb the literature for dozens of studies from the 1930s to the 2000s, that had measured either the rate of energy use in pregnant and non-pregnant females or the energy stored directly in the offspring. Overall, the team collated enough data to calculate the indirect and direct costs of reproduction for 81 species, ranging from microscopic animals called rotifers to fishes, snakes and humans.",
            "For the human data, for instance, the researchers drew on a 2004 paper that measured the metabolic rate of humans before and during pregnancy2. They used this to estimate the extra energy required during nine months of pregnancy \u2014 the indirect costs \u2014 and combined that with estimated direct costs, such as the total energy content of a newborn baby.",

It\u2019s not surprising that such measurements are rare in the literature, says Marshall.",
            "Instead, modellers have found it easier to calculate the energy stored in offspring \u2014 by simply estimating the amount of bone, fat and protein in the bodies of offspring and combining that with the known energy content of those components. Modellers assumed that this equalled the energy cost of reproduction. Some models have included estimates of indirect costs, but these costs were assumed to range from just 5% to 25% of the total energy spent on reproduction, depending on the model.",

Just 10% of the total energy is contained in the offspring. In humans, 96% of the 208,000 kilojoules (or nearly 50,000 kilocalories) required for reproduction is taken up by indirect costs.",

It will take time to make these revisions, says Marshall, because rewriting the models is not straightforward. But, in turn, this could shift the weight of evidence behind some theories as to why animals live the way they do, such as whether fish hit a maximum body size to conserve energy for reproduction, he says.",
            "Fresh estimates for reproductive energy use could also improve predictions of how species will evolve amid climate change, says Audzijonyte. This is because predictive models take into account factors such as the energy demands of reproduction, how heat alters the speed of reactions inside animals\u2019 bodies and how big animals grow.",
            "The study by Marshall and his team is just the first step towards quantifying the costs of reproduction across the animal kingdom, he says. Owing to scant data, the researchers often had to extrapolate the costs of pregnancy from measurements taken at just a few points during gestation, which limits the accuracy of their estimates, says Marshall. In future, studies that measure the indirect costs of reproduction throughout the entire gestation period will be needed, he says.",

For example, fasting has been shown to reduce the number of circulating monocytes, cells that defend the body against foreign invaders but that can be a hallmark of several autoimmune conditions3.",
            "Some researchers think that they can use such evidence to treat people with these conditions without them needing to eat less. For instance, Cheng Zhan, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, wanted to investigate a group of neurons in the brainstem that helps to regulate the immune system, to see whether manipulating them could elicit the desired effect.",
            "Yo-yo dieting accelerates cardiovascular disease by reprogramming the immune system",
            "In a paper published in January, Zhan and his team demonstrated that these neurons were activated in mice in response to fasting, and that they caused T cells to retreat from the blood, spleen and lymph nodes to their central reservoir, the bone marrow4. Zhan also used a mouse model of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis to show that the continuous activation of these neurons significantly alleviated paralysis, prevented disease-related weight loss and increased survival.",

For example, it could blunt immune responses. In a study published last year, Filip Swirski, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and his colleagues recorded a 90% reduction in monocytes circulating in the blood of fasting mice, and an increase in these cells in the bone marrow, where they are produced5.",
            "When the mice were fed after fasting for 24 hours, the monocytes flooded back into the blood in unusually large numbers, causing monocytosis, a condition usually associated with infectious and autoimmune disease. These post-fasting monocytes also lived longer than normal and had a lower-than-usual threshold for triggering inflammation. When the researchers infected the mice that had fasted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, the animals died sooner and in larger numbers than did non-fasted controls.",
            "Common sweetener suppresses mouse immune system \u2014 in high doses",

            "Further work is needed to understand the implications of the study in humans, but Swirski says it might warn against excessive or lengthy fasting. \u201cThere is plenty of evidence that fasting can be beneficial, but sometimes it\u2019s about finding a balance and not pushing your system to extremes.\u201d Swirski himself tends to skip lunch, \u201cbut I would not want to fast excessively\u201d, he says.",

The switch to the high-fat diet suppressed immunity and made mice more susceptible to bacterial infection6. It reduced the number and undermined the function of certain T cells that help the body to detect and memorize pathogens; further tests showed that the lack of fibre impaired the gut microbiome, which usually supports these T cells. \u201cI was surprised that changing the diet for just three days was enough time to see these dramatic effects on adaptive immune-system cells,\u201d adds Siracusa.",
            "When Siracusa asked six human volunteers to switch from a high-fibre to low-fibre diet, he saw similar effects on their T cells. The effects \u2014 as with any holiday feast \u2014 were transient, but Siracusa thinks that looking at these early immune events relating to changes in diet could reveal insights into the causes of chronic immune conditions. However, he emphasizes that he would not make dietary recommendations on the basis of this small proof-of-principle experiment. Furthermore, work in mice can provide only clues as to what happens in humans.",

Blood samples showed that shifting to either diet was linked to clear changes in both the numbers of different immune cells and which genes were being activated in them7.",
            "While on the ketogenic diet, participants had enhanced levels and activity of T and B cells that form part of the adaptive immune system, which mounts a \u2018precision\u2019 response that recognizes specific foes. Those on the vegan diet saw enhanced innate immune responses, which are quicker and less specific than adaptive responses. Belkaid was delighted to see such clear results and is excited at their clinical potential, but refuses to offer dietary advice on the basis of them at this stage. Yet, despite differences in age, genetics and body weight, she says, \u201cit was surprising to see how convergent the immune-system effects were\u201d in just two weeks. \u201cThe next step is to test dietary interventions for specific conditions in clinical trials that are as rigorous as those we do for drugs,\u201d she says.",

Others have done preliminary studies on the use of ketogenic diets as add-on therapies for psoriasis8 and type 1 diabetes9. There has also been a substantial increase in research into the use of diet and nutrition to boost the effects of therapies that co-opt the immune system to target cancer10. One study, published in 2021, found that higher dietary-fibre consumption was associated with improved survival in people receiving an immunotherapy for melanoma, and that mice with melanomas and that were fed a low-fibre diet had fewer killer T cells \u2014 which attack cancer cells \u2014 near their tumours11.",

Candidate tokens are pulled from the distribution, in numbers proportional to their probability, and placed in a \u2018tournament\u2019.

            "On 22 September, the magnet, at the Steady High Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) at the Chinese Academy of Science\u2019s Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, sustained a steady magnetic field of 42.02 tesla. This milestone narrowly surpasses the 41.4-tesla record set in 2017 by a resistive magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida. Resistive magnets are made of coiled metal wires and are widely used in magnet facilities across the world.",
            "China\u2019s record-breaker lays the groundwork for building reliable magnets that can sustain ever-stronger magnetic fields, which would help researchers to discover surprising new physics, says Joachim Wosnitza, a physicist at the Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Germany.",
            "The resistive magnet \u2014 which is open to international users \u2014 is the country\u2019s second major contribution to the global quest to produce ever-higher magnetic fields. In 2022, the SHMFF\u2019s hybrid magnet, which combines a resistive magnet with a superconducting one, produced a field of 45.22 tesla, making it the most powerful working steady-state magnet in the world.",
            "h2Research tool",
            "High-field magnets are handy tools for uncovering hidden properties of advanced materials, such as superconductors \u2014 materials that, under very low temperatures, carry electric current without producing waste heat. High fields also offer the chance to glimpse entirely new physical phenomena, says Marc-Henri Julien, a condensed-matter physicist at the National Laboratory for Intense Magnetic Fields in Grenoble, France. \u201cYou can create or manipulate new states of matter,\u201d says Julien.",
            "High fields are also useful for experiments that rely on very sensitive measurements, because they boost the resolution and make it easier to see faint phenomena, says Alexander Eaton, a condensed-matter physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK. \u201cEvery extra tesla is exponentially better than the last,\u201d he says.",
            "Guangli Kuang, a physicist who specializes in high magnetic fields at the SHMFF, says the team spent years modifying the magnet to hit the latest record. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to achieve,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Reliable but costly",
            "Resistive magnets are an older technology, but they can sustain high magnetic fields for longer periods than can their newer hybrid and fully superconducting counterparts, says Wosnitza. Their magnetic fields can also be ramped up much quicker, making them versatile experimental tools. \u201cYou can just twist a knob and go from zero tesla to high fields within minutes,\u201d he says.",
            "The big drawback of resistive magnets is the amount of power they consume, making them costly, says Eaton. For instance, the SHMFF\u2019s resistive magnet drew 32.3 megawatts of electricity to produce its record-breaking field. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a very good science case to justify that resource,\u201d says Eaton.",
            "That challenge is driving the race to develop hybrid and fully superconducting magnets that can generate high fields using less power. In 2019, NHMFL researchers built a miniature, proof-of-concept superconducting magnet that briefly sustained a 45.5-tesla field, and are currently developing a larger 40-tesla superconducting magnet that can be used for experiments. The team at the SHMFF is building a 55-tesla hybrid one. Although these newer magnets are expected to be cheaper to run than their resistive counterparts, they come with their own hurdles: they are more expensive to build and require complicated cooling systems, says engineer Mark Bird, a co-leader of the NHMFL\u2019s magnet science and technology division. \u201cThe technology is still being developed, and the costs are not clear yet,\u201d says Bird.",

            "Chicago, Illinois",
            "Hold the morning coffee and meditation: for about 75 days over the span of a year, neuroscientist Carina Heller\u2019s morning ritual included climbing into her university\u2019s brain scanner at 7:30 a.m. and lying perfectly still for an hour and a half \u2014 without falling asleep. By her estimates, this has made her the most-scanned woman in science.",
            "It\u2019s not the title she was after. Heller\u2019s goal was to catalogue how her brain changes during her menstrual cycle, with and without oral contraceptives. Her findings suggest that brain morphology and connectivity change daily throughout the natural cycle and are influenced by birth-control pills, according to preliminary results presented at this year\u2019s annual Society for Neuroscience conference.",
            "Heller is one of a cadre of women\u2019s health researchers who are tired of waiting for data to trickle in on a chronically understudied area, and have taken matters into their own hands by hopping into a brain-imaging machine. More data could offer women and their physicians greater agency to make \u201cbetter-informed decisions of whether they want to take the medication or not\u201d, and what specific formulations might be best suited for them, says Heller, who is based at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in Minneapolis.",
            "\u201cShe did this rigorous self-experimentation where she gave herself up to science,\u201d says Emily Jacobs, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who works with Heller. \u201cAnd as a result, we now have this greater insight into the human brain.\u201d",
            "h2Research gaps",
            "Oral contraceptives often contain synthetic versions of one or two hormones the body naturally produces: progesterone and oestrogen. These hormones prevent pregnancy in several ways, including by stopping the ovaries from releasing an egg.",
            "US regulators approved the first oral contraceptive in 1960. Within two years, more than one million people were taking \u2018the pill\u2019, as it became known. Today, more than 150 million people of reproductive age globally take oral contraceptives, placing them among the most-used medications in the world. Many take the pill for reasons unrelated to conception, such as managing acne, regulating menstrual cycles or helping to relieve menstrual symptoms and migraines.",
            "Decades of data on these medicines suggest that they are generally safe, but their effects on the brain remain understudied. For example, although some people report that they experience decreased depression and anxiety, others find that these symptoms worsen \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear why.",
            "Many people begin taking the pill during puberty, which is a crucial time for brain maturation, so it\u2019s important to understand how it affects neurodevelopment, says Kathryn Lenz, a behavioural neuroscientist at The Ohio State University in Columbus.",
            "h2The adaptable brain",
            "Most neuroimaging experiments use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to scan the brains of 10\u201330 participants only once or twice, which is costly to perform. This approach fails to account for daily variation in brain morphology and connectivity.",
            "A growing number of neuroimaging studies instead use a technique called \u2018dense sampling\u2019, in which researchers scan a single or handful of participants repeatedly to build a high-resolution data set. Dense sampling captures observations that might otherwise be overlooked, but the small sample size results in limited generalizability of findings to larger populations.",
            "Even so, by comparing data sets between participants \u2014 especially those who have different reactions to the pill \u2014 researchers might be able to pinpoint what drives different side effects.",

            "Using this approach, Heller scanned herself 25 times over 5 weeks, capturing images at different stages of her natural menstrual cycle. A few months later, she began taking oral contraceptives and then waited 3 months before scanning herself another 25 times in 5 weeks. At that point, Heller ceased taking the pill, waited another 3 months and scanned herself a final 25 times over 5 weeks. She also had blood drawn and completed a survey about her mood after each scan.",
            "Heller found a rhythmic pattern of change in brain volume and connectivity between brain regions over the course of her menstrual cycle, with volume and connectivity dipping slightly while she was taking oral contraceptives. (Higher brain volume or connectivity does not imply improved brain function, and vice versa.)",
            "This pattern largely returned to its former state after she stopped taking the medication, showing that the brain is \u201cquite adaptable\u201d, says Laura Pritschet, who conducted her graduate work with Jacobs and is now a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.",
            "h2An expanding network",
            "Heller drew inspiration from a study in which Pritschet scanned her own brain for 30 consecutive days during her natural menstrual cycle and for 30 more days while taking oral contraceptives. This was part of a project that Pritschet calls 28andMe: the name is a nod to the consumer-genetics firm 23andMe in South San Francisco, California, and the 28 days in a canonical menstrual cycle.",
            "Data from Pritschet\u2019s project showed that higher levels of oestrogen drive certain important brain networks to become more functionally connected1. One of these was the \u2018default mode network\u2019, which is active during daydreaming and is involved in memory. Progesterone had the opposite effect. Pritschet also scanned her husband over 30 consecutive days in a spin-off project called 28andHe, to understand the effects of hormone fluctuations in the male brain2.",
            "Next, Heller plans to compare her data with those from a woman with endometriosis, a painful condition that affects up to 10% of women at reproductive age, to understand whether hormone fluctuations in the brain could be driving the condition.",
            "These data sets are \u201cgoing to give us a really intriguing window into the relationship between hormonal status and subtle changes in brain structure and behavioural functions\u201d, Lenz says.",
