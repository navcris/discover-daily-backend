            "Eleanor Maguire wasn\u2019t too thrilled when she was first offered an Ig Nobel Prize. The neuroscientist at University College London was being honoured for her study showing that London taxi drivers have larger hippocampi in their brains than do people in other professions1. But she worried that accepting the prize would be a disaster for her career. So, she quietly turned it down.",
            "Three years later, the prize\u2019s founder, Marc Abrahams, contacted Maguire again with the same offer. This time, she knew more about the satirical award that bills itself as honouring achievements that \u201cmake people laugh, then think\u201d. She decided to accept. On the way to the ceremony, her taxi driver was so delighted to learn about his enlarged hippocampus that he refused to accept a fee from her.",
            "Maguire credits the prize with bringing more attention to her work. \u201cIt was useful for my career because people wanted to talk about it,\u201d she says, adding that \u201cit was on the front pages of newspapers when it came out and struck a chord with people.\u201d",
            "How to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?",
            "As one measure of the Ig Nobel\u2019s impact, Maguire says that she was once introduced as \u201cthe most famous member\u201d of a panel that happened to also include three Nobel laureates. \u201cThere were only questions about taxi drivers, and not anything to the Nobel laureates there.\u201d",
            "Other researchers have similar stories about winning the famous \u2014 some would say \u2018infamous\u2019 \u2014 awards. Abrahams created them in 1991, after years of collecting examples of weird research that he included in the Journal of Irreproducible Results, which he was editor of at the time. \u201cI kept meeting people who\u2019d unknowingly done very funny things that almost no one knew about.\u201d",
            "The response from the scientific community was mixed at the start, but Abrahams says that the Ig Nobels are not out to harm anyone\u2019s career. And last year, the prize received more than 9,000 nominations, a sign of how much it has grown, he says.",
            "Beyond the fun, several researchers who have won an \u2018Ig\u2019 say that it has improved their careers by helping them to reach wider audiences, and it has prompted some scientists to spend more time engaging with the public about their work. Here are their stories.",
            "h2The duck guy",
            "For Kees Moeliker, an Ig Nobel had a profound influence on his work \u2014 and his life. In 1995, the ornithologist was looking out of the glass wall of his office at the Natural History Museum Rotterdam in the Netherlands, when he heard the sound of a duck flying into it. He went outside and saw a live duck mounting the dead one that had just hit the window. It was the first documented case of homosexual necrophilia in ducks, says Moeliker, who reported his findings six years later2. He expected that only a handful of people would read the paper, but then he received a phone call in 2003 offering him an Ig Nobel Prize.",
            "\u201cAfter I won the prize, my paper got a huge readership, and people keep sending me stuff that you don\u2019t read about in the mainstream journals,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a huge compilation of cases of remarkable animal behaviour.\u201d",

            "Kees Moeliker won an Ig Nobel prize for his work on homosexual necrophilia in ducks.Credit: Anne Claire de Breij",
            "The duck paper and the Ig Nobel marked a turning point for Moeliker. He became known as \u2018the duck guy\u2019 and published a book of the same name: De eendenman (2009; in Dutch). In 2013, he gave a TED Talk titled \u2018How a dead duck changed my life\u2019.",
            "Since the Ig Nobel, Moeliker has dedicated a large part of his life to science communication alongside his research. Now the director of the museum in Rotterdam, he has also kept up his connection with the Ig Nobels. He is part of the team that decides who wins, and he often informs scientists in Europe who have been selected.",
            "One of his favourite winners was a pair of researchers who had dressed up as polar bears to study how reindeer in the Arctic would react. \u201cWhen I called them, they just started screaming with happiness. This happens all the time.\u201d",
            "h2Friday-night experiments",
            "The only person with both a Nobel and Ig Nobel Prize is Andre Geim, a physicist at the University of Manchester, UK. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for the discovery of graphene, but the Ig Nobel came a decade earlier for a very different kind of work: using a magnet to levitate a frog. One Friday night at Radboud University in the Netherlands, Geim poured water into a powerful 16-tesla magnet and found that it levitated. The floating drop shocked his colleagues because it seemed to violate ideas about magnetism.",
            "Success with water led to a series of other experiments with levitating objects \u2014 and eventually with a small frog that survived its wild ride unharmed.",
            "You must be joking: funny paper titles might lead to more citations",
            "When Geim was offered the award, he was an early-career researcher and wary of accepting it on his own. So he reached out to Michael Berry, a theoretical physicist at the University of Bristol, UK, and Geim\u2019s co-author on a paper describing the levitating frog3. As a tenured academic, Berry provided the cover of being associated with a highly respected scientist.",
            "Geim talks often about his frog experiment and the value of the curiosity-led science that led to his Ig Nobel Prize. It was on another Friday night, several years after the levitation experiments, that Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who is now at the National University of Singapore, stuck a piece of tape to graphite, leading to their discovery of graphene4 \u2014 and their shared Nobel prize.",
            "Geim and Maguire aren\u2019t the only Ig Nobel winners who had qualms about accepting the prize. And Abrahams has built in allowances for that. He and his colleagues contact potential recipients confidentially months before the prize-giving ceremony and offer them the chance to accept or reject the award. Abrahams also arranges for them to be handed out by Nobel prize-winners at the annual ceremony. \u201cTo have these credible people be a part of it makes it much harder for anyone to jump to the conclusion that we are out to do damage,\u201d he says.",
            "Not everyone has been so pleased to receive the award. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, was part of a group of nearly 1,000 people who won the 1993 Ig Nobel Literature prize for \u201cpublishing a medical research paper which has one hundred times as many authors as pages\u201d. He says that the study should not have been made light of; at the time, it was the largest heart-attack study in history, with more than 40,000 participants5, he adds.",
            "Topol says that he thinks the name Ig Nobel \u201cis out of alignment with the more recent ones. They\u2019re more for humour\u2019s sake.\u201d",
            "Abrahams agrees, saying, \u201cIn retrospect, I kind of wish we\u2019d chosen a different name.\u201d",
            "h2Running on water",
            "In the past two decades, most of the awards have gone to lighter research \u2014 sometimes quite literally. So it was for a 2013 prize for Alberto Minetti at the University of Milan in Italy.",
            "Minetti studies the biomechanics of locomotion and has long had an interest in the forces involved in running. When he learnt that spacecraft orbiting the Moon had detected evidence of water in 2008, he wondered whether a person could run on water on the Moon, which has a gravitational force only about 16% as strong as that of Earth.",
            "Using mathematical models from the basilisk lizard (Basiliscus basiliscus) and the western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), two vertebrates that can run on the surface of water, Minetti calculated that it was theoretically possible. Then, he and his colleagues tested their calculations by attaching a person to a harness to simulate weaker gravity. With the aid of small fins on his feet, a participant was able to stay afloat while running in place in a wading pool, the researchers reported6 in 2012.",
            "The following year, Minetti received a phone call from Abrahams, who offered him an Ig Nobel. At the time, he wasn\u2019t sure of the prize\u2019s standing or what it would do to his reputation, so he conducted a survey among his colleagues. \u201cMost of the people I spoke to were very positive about it,\u201d says Minetti.",

The 2024 physiology prize was won by a team for \u201cdiscovering that many mammals are capable of breathing through their anus\u201d. The lead author of the study7, Ryo Okabe at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, has been treating patients as a clinician for more than 15 years, while also carrying out research projects. The research behind the Ig Nobel was a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers wanted to see whether they could develop an alternative breathing method in the event of respiratory failure.",
            "He was honoured to win the prize and thinks that the award will be a driving force to conduct future research. \u201cI learnt that [the other laureates] are all engaged in their respective research with humour and passion.\u201d",
            "Scientists reveal weirdest things they\u2019ve done in the name of science",
            "The Ig Nobel has come a long way since it was launched more than three decades ago. What started as a prize that scientists were wary of has been embraced by many.",
            "Minna Lyons, who won the prize in 2014 along with her colleagues, still cherishes her Ig Nobel. \u201cIt has been one of the best surprises in my academic career, by far.\u201d She won for \u201camassing evidence that people who habitually stay up late are, on average, more self-admiring, more manipulative, and more psychopathic than people who wake up early in the morning\u201d.",
            "Lyons, who is a psychologist at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, says that the prize is excellent for public engagement because it makes science popular, and for this reason, the Ig Nobel is one of the most respected academic awards in her field, she says.",

The constant bombardment by micrometeorites and high-energy solar particles breaks up rocks into dust, which can then fly unimpeded by an atmosphere and land elsewhere, explains Yi-Gang Xu, a co-author of the Science paper, and a petrologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guangzhou.",

            "This memory arises because the experience of obesity leads to changes in the epigenome \u2014 a set of chemical tags that can be added to or removed from cells\u2019 DNA and proteins that help to dial gene activity up or down. For fat cells, the shift in gene activity seems to render them incapable of their normal function. This impairment, as well as the changes in gene activity, can linger long after weight has dropped to healthy levels, a study published today in Nature reports.",

            "h2A lingering memory",

They found that some genes were more active in the obesity group\u2019s fat cells than in the control group\u2019s fat cells, whereas other genes were less active.",

Two years after the participants with obesity had had weight-reduction operations, they had lost large amounts of weight \u2014 but their fat cells\u2019 genetic activity still displayed the obesity-linked pattern. The scientists found similar results in mice that had lost large amounts of weight.",
            "In the fat cells of both humans and mice, the genes dialled up during obesity are involved in spurring inflammation and fibrosis \u2014 the formation of stiff, scar-like tissue. The genes that are turned down help fat cells to function normally. Research on mice traced these shifts in gene activity to changes in the epigenome, which has a powerful effect on how active a gene is, including whether it is turned on at all.",
            "The scientists tested the durability of these changes by putting obese mice on a diet. A few months after the mice had become lean again, the changes in their epigenomes persisted, as if the cells \u2018remembered\u2019 being in a body with obesity.",

            "To better understand the effects of this memory, the researchers studied fat cells from mice that had slimmed down after being obese.

            "The study involved an elaborate three-step experiment in mice. First, they put some adult mice in a stressed state by injecting them with the stress hormone corticosterone or restraining them in a small tube for 30 minutes, which increased their corticosterone levels.",
            "They then placed mice \u2014 some stressed, and others not \u2014 in a chamber and played a medium-pitched sound for 30 seconds, a neutral event. After a break, the mice went back into the chamber and experienced a high-pitched whistling sound for 30 seconds, which ended with a 2-second shock to the foot, to mimic a fearful event.",
            "To test how the mice had stored the memories of these experiences, the researchers put the mice in a new environment and played the two tones \u2014 watching for how they responded. ",
            "The unstressed mice froze mostly when they heard the high-pitched whistling, whereas the stressed mice froze in response to both sounds, suggesting that they couldn\u2019t distinguish between the neutral and fearful events. ",
            "h2Exclusive club",
            "The researchers used various techniques to visualize neural activity in the rodents. They found that, during memory formation, the unstressed mice formed small engrams in response to the whistle and foot shock, and these were only reactivated when exposed to the whistle. But the stressed mice formed larger engrams, which were reactivated when exposed to both sounds. ",
            "Further experiments uncovered the chain of events in the brain that created the larger engram in stressed mice. Under normal conditions, specific neurons in the amygdala block neuronal activity through the release of chemical messengers known as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This ensures that a small engram is created in response to a negative memory. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the velvet rope at a nightclub: it only lets certain neurons into the nightclub,\u201d says Josselyn. But under stress, excitatory neurons pump the brain with a neurotransmitter known as endocannabinoid, which binds to glucocorticoid receptors on those inhibitory neurons and prevents them from releasing GABA, resulting in larger engrams. In other words, the velvet rope drops, \u201cand many neurons can get into this exclusive club\u201d, says Josselyn.",
            "The team were able to reverse the effects of stress on memory formation with two drugs, one of which is approved for terminating early pregnancy, mifepristone. The drugs either block the glucocorticoid receptors or the production of endocannabinoids, and the stressed mice recalled memories in the way that unstressed mice did. But researchers caution that the medications have side effects beyond the brain, and work only if they are given at the time the memory is formed, so are unlikely to be useful in people.",
            "Josselyn and her colleagues are now trying to investigate whether engrams can be altered after a memory has formed, or whether there are other ways of mitigating the effects of stress on memory.",

            "Using an imaging tool, Pollen and his colleagues showed that two dopamine-demanding regions of the brain are considerably bigger in humans than in macaques. The prefrontal cortex is 18 times larger, and the striatum nearly seven times bigger.",
            "How your brain detects patterns in the everyday: without conscious thought",
            "Yet humans have only around twice as many dopamine neurons as their primate relatives, says Pollen. These neurons therefore have to stretch further and work harder \u2014 each forming more than two million synapses \u2014 in the larger, more complex human brain.",
            "\u201cThe dopamine neurons are real athletes,\u201d says Nenad Sestan, a developmental neuroscientist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cThey are constantly activated.\u201d",
            "To understand how human dopamine neurons might have adapted to cope with the demands of a large brain, Pollen and his colleagues grew versions of these cells in the lab.",
            "They combined stem cells \u2014 which can develop into many cell types \u2014 from eight humans, seven chimpanzees, three macaques and one orangutan and grew them into miniature, brain-like structures called organoids. After 30 days, these structures started producing dopamine, mimicking a developing brain.",
            "The team then genetically sequenced the dopamine neurons to measure which genes were switched on and how they were controlled.",
            "CRISPR helps brain stem cells regain youth in mice",
            "In an analysis of human and chimpanzee neurons, the researchers found that the human neurons expressed higher levels of genes that manage oxidative stress \u2014 a type of cell damage that can be caused by the energy-intensive process of producing dopamine. These genes encode enzymes that break down and neutralize toxic molecules, called reactive oxygen species, that can harm cells.",
            "To investigate whether human dopamine neurons might have have evolved unique stress responses, the authors applied a pesticide that causes oxidative stress to the organoids. They found that neurons that had developed from human cells increased their production of a molecule known as BDNF, which is reduced in people with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease. They did not see the same response in chimpanzee neurons.",

            "\u201cThere are some candidate targets that might be very interesting to perturb and then transplant in [animal] models of Parkinson\u2019s disease to see whether these endow the neurons with more resilience,\u201d says Pollen.",
            "The organoids in the study represent developing neurons, equivalent to those that are present in an embryo, and do not fully capture the complexity of adult neurons. Future research will need to explore how such protective mechanisms hold up in mature and ageing neurons, says Sousa, because \u201cdegenerative diseases that affect these cells are usually at a late age\u201d.",

            "When Sam Rodriques was a neurobiology graduate student, he was struck by a fundamental limitation of science. Even if researchers had already produced all the information needed to understand a human cell or a brain, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we would know it\u201d, he says, \u201cbecause no human has the ability to understand or read all the literature and get a comprehensive view.\u201d",
            "Five years later, Rodriques says he is closer to solving that problem using artificial intelligence (AI). In September, he and his team at the US start-up FutureHouse announced that an AI-based system they had built could, within minutes, produce syntheses of scientific knowledge that were more accurate than Wikipedia pages1. The team promptly generated Wikipedia-style entries on around 17,000 human genes, most of which previously lacked a detailed page.",
            "How AI-powered science search engines can speed up your research",
            "Rodriques is not the only one turning to AI to help synthesize science. For decades, scholars have been trying to accelerate the onerous task of compiling bodies of research into reviews. \u201cThey\u2019re too long, they\u2019re incredibly intensive and they\u2019re often out of date by the time they\u2019re written,\u201d says Iain Marshall, who studies research synthesis at King\u2019s College London. The explosion of interest in large language models (LLMs), the generative-AI programs that underlie tools such as ChatGPT, is prompting fresh excitement about automating the task.",
            "Some of the newer AI-powered science search engines can already help people to produce narrative literature reviews \u2014 a written tour of studies \u2014 by finding, sorting and summarizing publications. But they can\u2019t yet produce a high-quality review by themselves. The toughest challenge of all is the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 systematic review, which involves stringent procedures to search and assess papers, and often a meta-analysis to synthesize the results. Most researchers agree that these are a long way from being fully automated. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll eventually get there,\u201d says Paul Glasziou, a specialist in evidence and systematic reviews at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia. \u201cI just can\u2019t tell you whether that\u2019s 10 years away or 100 years away.\u201d",
            "At the same time, however, researchers fear that AI tools could lead to more sloppy, inaccurate or misleading reviews polluting the literature. \u201cThe worry is that all the decades of research on how to do good evidence synthesis starts to be undermined,\u201d says James Thomas, who studies evidence synthesis at University College London.",
            "h2Computer-assisted reviews",
            "Computer software has been helping researchers to search and parse the research literature for decades. Well before LLMs emerged, scientists were using machine-learning and other algorithms to help to identify particular studies or to quickly pull findings out of papers. But the advent of systems such as ChatGPT has triggered a frenzy of interest in speeding up this process by combining LLMs with other software.",
            "AI science search engines are exploding in number \u2014 are they any good? ",
            "It would be terribly naive to ask ChatGPT \u2014 or any other AI chatbot \u2014 to simply write an academic literature review from scratch, researchers say. These LLMs generate text by training on enormous amounts of writing, but most commercial AI firms do not reveal what data the models were trained on. If asked to review research on a topic, an LLM such as ChatGPT is likely to draw on credible academic research, inaccurate blogs and who knows what other information, says Marshall. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no weighing up of what the most pertinent, high-quality literature is,\u201d he says. And because LLMs work by repeatedly generating statistically plausible words in response to a query, they produce different answers to the same question and \u2018hallucinate\u2019 errors \u2014 including, notoriously, non-existent academic references. \u201cNone of the processes which are regarded as good practice in research synthesis take place,\u201d Marshall says.",
            "A more sophisticated process involves uploading a corpus of pre-selected papers to an LLM, and asking it to extract insights from them, basing its answer only on those studies. This \u2018retrieval-augmented generation\u2019 seems to cut down on hallucinations, although it does not prevent them. The process can also be set up so that the LLM will reference the sources it drew its information from.",
            "This is the basis for specialized, AI-powered science search engines such as Consensus and Elicit. Most companies do not reveal exact details of how their systems work. But they typically turn a user\u2019s question into a computerized search across academic databases such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed, returning the most relevant results.",
            "An LLM then summarizes each of these studies and synthesizes them into an answer that cites its sources; the user is given various options to filter the work they want to include. \u201cThey are search engines first and foremost,\u201d says Aaron Tay, who heads data services at Singapore Management University and blogs about AI tools. \u201cAt the very least, what they cite is definitely real.\u201d",
            "These tools \u201ccan certainly make your review and writing processes efficient\u201d, says Mushtaq Bilal, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, who trains academics in AI tools and has designed his own, called Research Kick. Another AI system called Scite, for example, can quickly generate a detailed breakdown of papers that support or refute a claim. Elicit and other systems can also extract insights from different sections of papers \u2014 the methods, conclusions and so on. There\u2019s \u201ca huge amount of labour that you can outsource\u201d, Bilal says.",

Their output is more \u201cat the level of an undergraduate student who pulls an all-nighter and comes up with the main points of a few papers\u201d. It is better for researchers to use the tools to optimize parts of the review process, he says. James Brady, head of engineering at Elicit, says that its users are augmenting steps of reviewing \u201cto great effect\u201d.",
            "Another limitation of some tools, including Elicit, is that they can only search open-access papers and abstracts, rather than the full text of articles. (Elicit, in Oakland, California, searches about 125 million papers; Consensus, in Boston, Massachusetts, looks at more than 200 million.) Bilal notes that much of the research literature is paywalled and it\u2019s computationally intensive to search a lot of full text. \u201cRunning an AI app through the whole text of millions of articles will take a lot of time, and it will become prohibitively expensive,\u201d he says.",

            "This September, Rodriques and his team revealed PaperQA2, FutureHouse\u2019s open-source, prototype AI system1. When it is given a query, PaperQA2 searches several academic databases for relevant papers and tries to access the full text of both open-access and paywalled content. (Rodriques says the team has access to many paywalled papers through its members\u2019 academic affiliations.) The system then identifies and summarizes the most relevant elements. In part because PaperQA2 digests the full text of papers, running it is expensive, he says.",
            "The FutureHouse team tested the system by using it to generate Wikipedia-style articles on individual human genes. They then gave several hundred AI-written statements from these articles, along with statements from real (human-written) Wikipedia articles on the same topic, to a blinded panel of PhD and postdoctoral biologists. The panel found that human-authored articles contained twice as many \u2018reasoning errors\u2019 \u2014 in which a written claim is not properly supported by the citation \u2014 than did ones written by the AI tool.

            "h2Systematic challenge",
            "Narrative summaries of the literature are hard enough to produce, but systematic reviews are even worse. They can take people many months or even years to complete2.",
            "A systematic review involves at least 25 careful steps, according to a breakdown from Glasziou\u2019s team. After combing through the literature, a researcher must filter their longlist to find the most pertinent papers, then extract data, screen studies for potential bias and synthesize the results. (Many of these steps are done in duplicate by another researcher to check for inconsistencies.) This laborious method \u2014 which is supposed to be rigorous, transparent and reproducible \u2014 is considered worthwhile in medicine, for instance, because clinicians use the results to guide important decisions about treating patients.",
            " ChatGPT-like AIs are coming to major science search engines",
            "In 2019, before ChatGPT came along, Glasziou and his colleagues set out to achieve a world record in science: a systematic review in two weeks. He and others, including Marshall and Thomas, had already developed computer tools to reduce the time involved. The menu of software available by that time included RobotSearch, a machine-learning model trained to quickly identify randomized trials from a collection of studies. RobotReviewer, another AI system, helps to assess whether a study is at risk of bias because it was not adequately blinded, for instance. \u201cAll of those are important little tools in shaving down the time of doing a systematic review,\u201d Glasziou says.",
            "The clock started at 9:30 a.m. on Monday 21 January 2019. The team cruised across the line at lunchtime on Friday 1 February, after a total of nine working days3. \u201cI was excited,\u201d says epidemiologist Anna Mae Scott at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the study while at Bond University; everyone celebrated with cake. Since then, the team has pared its record down to five days.",
            "Could the process get faster? Other researchers have been working to automate aspects of systematic reviews, too. In 2015, Glasziou founded the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews, a niche community that, fittingly, has produced several systematic reviews about tools for automating systematic reviews4. But even so, \u201cnot very many [tools] have seen widespread acceptance\u201d, says Marshall. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how mature the technology is.\u201d",
            "Elicit is one company that says its tool helps researchers with systematic reviews, not just narrative ones. The firm does not offer systematic reviews at the push of a button, says Brady, but its system does automate some of the steps \u2014 including screening papers and extracting data and insights. Brady says that most researchers who use it for systematic reviews have uploaded relevant papers they find using other search techniques.",
            "Systematic-review aficionados worry that AI tools are at risk of failing to meet two essential criteria of the studies: transparency and reproducibility. \u201cIf I can\u2019t see the methods used, then it is not a systematic review, it is simply a review article,\u201d says Justin Clark, who builds review automation tools as part of Glasziou\u2019s team. Brady says that the papers that reviewers upload to Elicit \u201care an excellent, transparent record\u201d of their starting literature. As for reproducibility: \u201cWe don\u2019t guarantee that our results are always going to be identical across repeats of the same steps, but we aim to make it so \u2014 within reason,\u201d he says, adding that transparency and reproducibility will be important as the firm improves its system.",
            "Specialists in reviewing say they would like to see more published evaluations of the accuracy and reproducibility of AI systems that have been designed to help produce literature reviews. \u201cBuilding cool tools and trying stuff out is really good fun,\u201d says Clark. \u201cDoing a hardcore evaluative study is a lot of hard work.\u201d",
            "Audit AI search tools now, before they skew research",
            "Earlier this year, Clark led a systematic review of studies that had used generative AI tools to help with systematic reviewing. He and his team found only 15 published studies in which the AI\u2019s performance had been adequately compared with that of a person. The results, which have not yet been published or peer reviewed, suggest that these AI systems can extract some data from uploaded studies and assess the risk of bias of clinical trials. \u201cIt seems to do OK with reading and assessing papers,\u201d Clark says, \u201cbut it did very badly at all these other tasks\u201d, including designing and conducting a thorough literature search. (Existing computer software can already do the final step of synthesizing data using a meta-analysis.)",
            "Glasziou and his team are still trying to shave time off their reviewing record through improved tools, which are available on a website they call the Evidence Review Accelerator. \u201cIt won\u2019t be one big thing. It\u2019s that every year you\u2019ll get faster and faster,\u201d Glasziou predicts. In 2022, for instance, the group released a computerized tool called Methods Wizard, which asks users a series of questions about their methods and then writes a protocol for them without using AI.",
            "h2Rushed reviews?",
            "Automating the synthesis of information also comes with risks. Researchers have known for years that many systematic reviews are redundant or of poor quality5, and AI could make these problems worse. Authors might knowingly or unknowingly use AI tools to race through a review that does not follow rigorous procedures, or which includes poor-quality work, and get a misleading result.",
            "By contrast, says Glasziou, AI could also encourage researchers to do a quick check of previously published literature when they wouldn\u2019t have bothered before. \u201cAI may raise their game,\u201d he says. And Brady says that, in future, AI tools could help to flag and filter out poor-quality papers by looking for telltale signs such as P-hacking, a form of data manipulation.",
            "Glasziou sees the situation as a balance of two forces: AI tools could help scientists to produce high-quality reviews, but might also fuel the rapid generation of substandard ones. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the net impact is going to be on the published literature,\u201d he says.",
            "Some people argue that the ability to synthesize and make sense of the world\u2019s knowledge should not lie solely in the hands of opaque, profit-making companies. Clark wants to see non-profit groups build and carefully test AI tools. He and other researchers welcomed the announcement from two UK funders last month that they are investing more than US$70 million in evidence-synthesis systems. \u201cWe just want to be cautious and careful,\u201d Clark says. \u201cWe want to make sure that the answers that [technology] is helping to provide to us are correct.\u201d",

In September 2020, he published a breakthrough study in Nature1, which claimed that a compound made of carbon, sulfur and hydrogen (CSH) is a superconductor at room-temperature. And in March 2023, he published another in Nature2 finding that a compound of lutetium, hydrogen and nitrogen is a room-temperature superconductor at pressures 100 times lower than CSH \u2014 conditions even more practical for commercial use. (Nature\u2019s news team is editorially independent from its journals team.)",

For treating \u2018uncomplicated\u2019, or non-severe, cases of malaria, the World Health Organization recommends a course of pills containing an artemisinin derivative, which rapidly eliminates most malaria parasites in the body, combined with a \u2018partner\u2019 drug that circulates in the body for longer and kills the remaining parasites. These regimens are called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).",
            "For severe malaria, which can involve symptoms such as convulsions, breathing problems and abnormal bleeding, treatment is more intensive. Physicians administer intravenous artesunate \u2014 a fast-acting version of artemisinin \u2014 for at least 24 hours. This is followed by a course of ACT. Treating severe malaria rapidly is crucial for recovery, researchers say.",

            "The latest study, in Jinja, Uganda, looked at children aged 6 months to 12 years with severe malaria. The researchers found that 11 of the 100 participants, or about 10%, showed partial artemisinin resistance. This term refers to a delay in the clearance of the malaria parasite from the body after treatment; a partially resistant infection is classified as one in which the drug takes longer than 5 hours to kill half of the malaria parasites.",
            "How to defuse malaria\u2019s ticking time bomb",
            "In the past, researchers have connected specific mutations in P. falciparum proteins with the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance2 \u2014 meaning that the parasites are evolving to evade the \u2018gold standard\u2019 malaria treatment. John and colleagues analysed the genomes of the parasites infecting children in their study, and found that ten participants had one of two types of these mutations. One of the mutations, detected in eight participants, was associated with artemisinin taking longer than usual to clear the parasite.",
            "Another group of ten children in the study had a malaria infection that recurred after their treatment concluded. These cases were not attributable to the presence of any known artemisinin-resistance mutations. Instead, John thinks the recurrence might have been caused by resistance to lumefantrine, a partner drug administered orally in the ACT step of the treatment regimen for severe malaria. But more studies are needed to evaluate that possibility, John says. \u201cWhat the recurrence suggests to us is that maybe that partner drug is not working as well as it should, because the parasites are coming back,\u201d he adds.",
            "Since resistance to artemisinin was first identified in southeast Asia in the 2000s, scientists\u2019 biggest concern has been how it will affect the treatment of severe cases of malaria, says Philip Rosenthal, a malaria specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cEven if the drug still works, that slower action could make a difference and lead to higher levels of mortality,\u201d he says.",
            "But the study by John and his colleagues doesn\u2019t provide a definitive answer to whether artemisinin resistance is already leading to worse clinical outcomes, Rosenthal notes. The study size was too small, and all the children analysed eventually recovered, even if this process sometimes took longer than expected. That just shows that current treatments for severe malaria aren\u2019t \u201cquite as good as we might have hoped\u201d, he says.",
            "Rosenthal and others are still worried about this news, however. \u201cThe emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa is a major threat to malaria control,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are now only starting to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d ",

High temperatures tend to be found closest to the surface in regions with active volcanism, or where the continental crust is thinner than average. A survey by the DoE, for example, shows that the western side of the United States has a much greater potential than the eastern side for extracting this energy at a profit (see \u2018Patchy potential\u2019).",

Whether this can be done without causing excessive wear-and-tear will be a major test for upcoming facilities.",
