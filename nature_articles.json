            "This memory arises because the experience of obesity leads to changes in the epigenome \u2014 a set of chemical tags that can be added to or removed from cells\u2019 DNA and proteins that help to dial gene activity up or down. For fat cells, the shift in gene activity seems to render them incapable of their normal function. This impairment, as well as the changes in gene activity, can linger long after weight has dropped to healthy levels, a study published today in Nature reports.",
            "The results suggest that people trying to slim down will often require long-term care to avoid weight regain, says study co-author Laura Hinte, a biologist at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. \u201cIt means that you need more help, potentially,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d",

            "To understand why weight can pile back on so quickly after it is lost, Hinte and her colleagues analysed fat tissue from a group of people with severe obesity, as well as from a control group of people who had never had obesity. They found that some genes were more active in the obesity group\u2019s fat cells than in the control group\u2019s fat cells, whereas other genes were less active.",

Two years after the participants with obesity had had weight-reduction operations, they had lost large amounts of weight \u2014 but their fat cells\u2019 genetic activity still displayed the obesity-linked pattern. The scientists found similar results in mice that had lost large amounts of weight.",
            "In the fat cells of both humans and mice, the genes dialled up during obesity are involved in spurring inflammation and fibrosis \u2014 the formation of stiff, scar-like tissue. The genes that are turned down help fat cells to function normally. Research on mice traced these shifts in gene activity to changes in the epigenome, which has a powerful effect on how active a gene is, including whether it is turned on at all.",
            "The scientists tested the durability of these changes by putting obese mice on a diet. A few months after the mice had become lean again, the changes in their epigenomes persisted, as if the cells \u2018remembered\u2019 being in a body with obesity.",

            "But scientists not involved in the study, including Roh, note that the paper doesn\u2019t prove that the epigenetic alterations caused the physical changes in the mice. The paper\u2019s list of epigenetic alterations in fat cells is valuable, says biologist Evan Rosen at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, who studies fat tissue, but it will be difficult to determine which of those changes drive the fat cells\u2019 lingering memory.",

Sheena Josselyn, a neuroscientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada, and her colleagues looked at whether stress disrupts engram formation and focused on a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is involved in stress and emotion response.",
            "The study involved an elaborate three-step experiment in mice. First, they put some adult mice in a stressed state by injecting them with the stress hormone corticosterone or restraining them in a small tube for 30 minutes, which increased their corticosterone levels.",
            "They then placed mice \u2014 some stressed, and others not \u2014 in a chamber and played a medium-pitched sound for 30 seconds, a neutral event. After a break, the mice went back into the chamber and experienced a high-pitched whistling sound for 30 seconds, which ended with a 2-second shock to the foot, to mimic a fearful event.",
            "To test how the mice had stored the memories of these experiences, the researchers put the mice in a new environment and played the two tones \u2014 watching for how they responded. ",
            "The unstressed mice froze mostly when they heard the high-pitched whistling, whereas the stressed mice froze in response to both sounds, suggesting that they couldn\u2019t distinguish between the neutral and fearful events. ",
            "h2Exclusive club",
            "The researchers used various techniques to visualize neural activity in the rodents. They found that, during memory formation, the unstressed mice formed small engrams in response to the whistle and foot shock, and these were only reactivated when exposed to the whistle. But the stressed mice formed larger engrams, which were reactivated when exposed to both sounds. ",
            "Further experiments uncovered the chain of events in the brain that created the larger engram in stressed mice. Under normal conditions, specific neurons in the amygdala block neuronal activity through the release of chemical messengers known as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This ensures that a small engram is created in response to a negative memory. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like the velvet rope at a nightclub: it only lets certain neurons into the nightclub,\u201d says Josselyn. But under stress, excitatory neurons pump the brain with a neurotransmitter known as endocannabinoid, which binds to glucocorticoid receptors on those inhibitory neurons and prevents them from releasing GABA, resulting in larger engrams. In other words, the velvet rope drops, \u201cand many neurons can get into this exclusive club\u201d, says Josselyn.",
            "The team were able to reverse the effects of stress on memory formation with two drugs, one of which is approved for terminating early pregnancy, mifepristone. The drugs either block the glucocorticoid receptors or the production of endocannabinoids, and the stressed mice recalled memories in the way that unstressed mice did. But researchers caution that the medications have side effects beyond the brain, and work only if they are given at the time the memory is formed, so are unlikely to be useful in people.",
            "Josselyn and her colleagues are now trying to investigate whether engrams can be altered after a memory has formed, or whether there are other ways of mitigating the effects of stress on memory.",

High temperatures tend to be found closest to the surface in regions with active volcanism, or where the continental crust is thinner than average.

For treating \u2018uncomplicated\u2019, or non-severe, cases of malaria, the World Health Organization recommends a course of pills containing an artemisinin derivative, which rapidly eliminates most malaria parasites in the body, combined with a \u2018partner\u2019 drug that circulates in the body for longer and kills the remaining parasites. These regimens are called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).",

This term refers to a delay in the clearance of the malaria parasite from the body after treatment; a partially resistant infection is classified as one in which the drug takes longer than 5 hours to kill half of the malaria parasites.",
            "How to defuse malaria\u2019s ticking time bomb",
            "In the past, researchers have connected specific mutations in P. falciparum proteins with the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance2 \u2014 meaning that the parasites are evolving to evade the \u2018gold standard\u2019 malaria treatment. John and colleagues analysed the genomes of the parasites infecting children in their study, and found that ten participants had one of two types of these mutations. One of the mutations, detected in eight participants, was associated with artemisinin taking longer than usual to clear the parasite.",
            "Another group of ten children in the study had a malaria infection that recurred after their treatment concluded. These cases were not attributable to the presence of any known artemisinin-resistance mutations. Instead, John thinks the recurrence might have been caused by resistance to lumefantrine, a partner drug administered orally in the ACT step of the treatment regimen for severe malaria. But more studies are needed to evaluate that possibility, John says. \u201cWhat the recurrence suggests to us is that maybe that partner drug is not working as well as it should, because the parasites are coming back,\u201d he adds.",
            "Since resistance to artemisinin was first identified in southeast Asia in the 2000s, scientists\u2019 biggest concern has been how it will affect the treatment of severe cases of malaria, says Philip Rosenthal, a malaria specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cEven if the drug still works, that slower action could make a difference and lead to higher levels of mortality,\u201d he says.",
            "But the study by John and his colleagues doesn\u2019t provide a definitive answer to whether artemisinin resistance is already leading to worse clinical outcomes, Rosenthal notes. The study size was too small, and all the children analysed eventually recovered, even if this process sometimes took longer than expected. That just shows that current treatments for severe malaria aren\u2019t \u201cquite as good as we might have hoped\u201d, he says.",
            "Rosenthal and others are still worried about this news, however. \u201cThe emergence of artemisinin partial resistance in Africa is a major threat to malaria control,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are now only starting to understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d ",

Even if researchers had already produced all the information needed to understand a human cell or a brain, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we would know it\u201d, he says, \u201cbecause no human has the ability to understand or read all the literature and get a comprehensive view.\u201d",
            "Five years later, Rodriques says he is closer to solving that problem using artificial intelligence (AI). In September, he and his team at the US start-up FutureHouse announced that an AI-based system they had built could, within minutes, produce syntheses of scientific knowledge that were more accurate than Wikipedia pages1. The team promptly generated Wikipedia-style entries on around 17,000 human genes, most of which previously lacked a detailed page.",
            "How AI-powered science search engines can speed up your research",
            "Rodriques is not the only one turning to AI to help synthesize science. For decades, scholars have been trying to accelerate the onerous task of compiling bodies of research into reviews. \u201cThey\u2019re too long, they\u2019re incredibly intensive and they\u2019re often out of date by the time they\u2019re written,\u201d says Iain Marshall, who studies research synthesis at King\u2019s College London. The explosion of interest in large language models (LLMs), the generative-AI programs that underlie tools such as ChatGPT, is prompting fresh excitement about automating the task.",
            "Some of the newer AI-powered science search engines can already help people to produce narrative literature reviews \u2014 a written tour of studies \u2014 by finding, sorting and summarizing publications. But they can\u2019t yet produce a high-quality review by themselves. The toughest challenge of all is the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 systematic review, which involves stringent procedures to search and assess papers, and often a meta-analysis to synthesize the results. Most researchers agree that these are a long way from being fully automated. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll eventually get there,\u201d says Paul Glasziou, a specialist in evidence and systematic reviews at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia. \u201cI just can\u2019t tell you whether that\u2019s 10 years away or 100 years away.\u201d",
            "At the same time, however, researchers fear that AI tools could lead to more sloppy, inaccurate or misleading reviews polluting the literature. \u201cThe worry is that all the decades of research on how to do good evidence synthesis starts to be undermined,\u201d says James Thomas, who studies evidence synthesis at University College London.",
            "h2Computer-assisted reviews",
            "Computer software has been helping researchers to search and parse the research literature for decades. Well before LLMs emerged, scientists were using machine-learning and other algorithms to help to identify particular studies or to quickly pull findings out of papers. But the advent of systems such as ChatGPT has triggered a frenzy of interest in speeding up this process by combining LLMs with other software.",
            "AI science search engines are exploding in number \u2014 are they any good? ",
            "It would be terribly naive to ask ChatGPT \u2014 or any other AI chatbot \u2014 to simply write an academic literature review from scratch, researchers say. These LLMs generate text by training on enormous amounts of writing, but most commercial AI firms do not reveal what data the models were trained on. If asked to review research on a topic, an LLM such as ChatGPT is likely to draw on credible academic research, inaccurate blogs and who knows what other information, says Marshall. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no weighing up of what the most pertinent, high-quality literature is,\u201d he says. And because LLMs work by repeatedly generating statistically plausible words in response to a query, they produce different answers to the same question and \u2018hallucinate\u2019 errors \u2014 including, notoriously, non-existent academic references. \u201cNone of the processes which are regarded as good practice in research synthesis take place,\u201d Marshall says.",
            "A more sophisticated process involves uploading a corpus of pre-selected papers to an LLM, and asking it to extract insights from them, basing its answer only on those studies. This \u2018retrieval-augmented generation\u2019 seems to cut down on hallucinations, although it does not prevent them. The process can also be set up so that the LLM will reference the sources it drew its information from.",
            "This is the basis for specialized, AI-powered science search engines such as Consensus and Elicit. Most companies do not reveal exact details of how their systems work. But they typically turn a user\u2019s question into a computerized search across academic databases such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed, returning the most relevant results.",
            "An LLM then summarizes each of these studies and synthesizes them into an answer that cites its sources; the user is given various options to filter the work they want to include. \u201cThey are search engines first and foremost,\u201d says Aaron Tay, who heads data services at Singapore Management University and blogs about AI tools. \u201cAt the very least, what they cite is definitely real.\u201d",

Bilal notes that much of the research literature is paywalled and it\u2019s computationally intensive to search a lot of full text. \u201cRunning an AI app through the whole text of millions of articles will take a lot of time, and it will become prohibitively expensive,\u201d he says.",

In part because PaperQA2 digests the full text of papers, running it is expensive, he says.",

            "A systematic review involves at least 25 careful steps, according to a breakdown from Glasziou\u2019s team. After combing through the literature, a researcher must filter their longlist to find the most pertinent papers, then extract data, screen studies for potential bias and synthesize the results. (Many of these steps are done in duplicate by another researcher to check for inconsistencies.) This laborious method \u2014 which is supposed to be rigorous, transparent and reproducible \u2014 is considered worthwhile in medicine, for instance, because clinicians use the results to guide important decisions about treating patients.",
            " ChatGPT-like AIs are coming to major science search engines",
            "In 2019, before ChatGPT came along, Glasziou and his colleagues set out to achieve a world record in science: a systematic review in two weeks. He and others, including Marshall and Thomas, had already developed computer tools to reduce the time involved. The menu of software available by that time included RobotSearch, a machine-learning model trained to quickly identify randomized trials from a collection of studies. RobotReviewer, another AI system, helps to assess whether a study is at risk of bias because it was not adequately blinded, for instance. \u201cAll of those are important little tools in shaving down the time of doing a systematic review,\u201d Glasziou says.",
            "The clock started at 9:30 a.m. on Monday 21 January 2019. The team cruised across the line at lunchtime on Friday 1 February, after a total of nine working days3. \u201cI was excited,\u201d says epidemiologist Anna Mae Scott at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the study while at Bond University; everyone celebrated with cake. Since then, the team has pared its record down to five days.",
            "Could the process get faster? Other researchers have been working to automate aspects of systematic reviews, too. In 2015, Glasziou founded the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews, a niche community that, fittingly, has produced several systematic reviews about tools for automating systematic reviews4. But even so, \u201cnot very many [tools] have seen widespread acceptance\u201d, says Marshall. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how mature the technology is.\u201d",
            "Elicit is one company that says its tool helps researchers with systematic reviews, not just narrative ones. The firm does not offer systematic reviews at the push of a button, says Brady, but its system does automate some of the steps \u2014 including screening papers and extracting data and insights. Brady says that most researchers who use it for systematic reviews have uploaded relevant papers they find using other search techniques.",
            "Systematic-review aficionados worry that AI tools are at risk of failing to meet two essential criteria of the studies: transparency and reproducibility. \u201cIf I can\u2019t see the methods used, then it is not a systematic review, it is simply a review article,\u201d says Justin Clark, who builds review automation tools as part of Glasziou\u2019s team. Brady says that the papers that reviewers upload to Elicit \u201care an excellent, transparent record\u201d of their starting literature. As for reproducibility: \u201cWe don\u2019t guarantee that our results are always going to be identical across repeats of the same steps, but we aim to make it so \u2014 within reason,\u201d he says, adding that transparency and reproducibility will be important as the firm improves its system.",
            "Specialists in reviewing say they would like to see more published evaluations of the accuracy and reproducibility of AI systems that have been designed to help produce literature reviews. \u201cBuilding cool tools and trying stuff out is really good fun,\u201d says Clark. \u201cDoing a hardcore evaluative study is a lot of hard work.\u201d",
            "Audit AI search tools now, before they skew research",
            "Earlier this year, Clark led a systematic review of studies that had used generative AI tools to help with systematic reviewing. He and his team found only 15 published studies in which the AI\u2019s performance had been adequately compared with that of a person. The results, which have not yet been published or peer reviewed, suggest that these AI systems can extract some data from uploaded studies and assess the risk of bias of clinical trials. \u201cIt seems to do OK with reading and assessing papers,\u201d Clark says, \u201cbut it did very badly at all these other tasks\u201d, including designing and conducting a thorough literature search. (Existing computer software can already do the final step of synthesizing data using a meta-analysis.)",
            "Glasziou and his team are still trying to shave time off their reviewing record through improved tools, which are available on a website they call the Evidence Review Accelerator. \u201cIt won\u2019t be one big thing. It\u2019s that every year you\u2019ll get faster and faster,\u201d Glasziou predicts. In 2022, for instance, the group released a computerized tool called Methods Wizard, which asks users a series of questions about their methods and then writes a protocol for them without using AI.",
            "h2Rushed reviews?",
            "Automating the synthesis of information also comes with risks. Researchers have known for years that many systematic reviews are redundant or of poor quality5, and AI could make these problems worse. Authors might knowingly or unknowingly use AI tools to race through a review that does not follow rigorous procedures, or which includes poor-quality work, and get a misleading result.",
            "By contrast, says Glasziou, AI could also encourage researchers to do a quick check of previously published literature when they wouldn\u2019t have bothered before. \u201cAI may raise their game,\u201d he says. And Brady says that, in future, AI tools could help to flag and filter out poor-quality papers by looking for telltale signs such as P-hacking, a form of data manipulation.",
            "Glasziou sees the situation as a balance of two forces: AI tools could help scientists to produce high-quality reviews, but might also fuel the rapid generation of substandard ones. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the net impact is going to be on the published literature,\u201d he says.",
            "Some people argue that the ability to synthesize and make sense of the world\u2019s knowledge should not lie solely in the hands of opaque, profit-making companies. Clark wants to see non-profit groups build and carefully test AI tools. He and other researchers welcomed the announcement from two UK funders last month that they are investing more than US$70 million in evidence-synthesis systems. \u201cWe just want to be cautious and careful,\u201d Clark says. \u201cWe want to make sure that the answers that [technology] is helping to provide to us are correct.\u201d",

            "To address this problem, Zhang and his colleagues compared the genomes of cultivated tomato species (Solanum lycopersicum) with their much-sweeter wild counterparts.

Using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene-editing technology, the researchers deactivated the two genes and found that the plants bore fruit that was much sweeter than that of a widely cultivated variety.",

But the timing of the Pew survey means it could be used as a benchmark for tracking attitudes towards science during Trump\u2019s second term, he says.",
            "h2Partisan split",
            "Tyson and his colleagues polled 9,593 US residents using online and phone surveys between 21 and 27 October. Participants were asked to indicate how much they agreed with statements about scientists\u2019 intelligence, communication skills, compassion for the public and engagement in policy.",
            "Almost 90% of survey respondents who identified themselves as Democrats indicated a belief that scientists act in the public\u2019s best interest. The figure for Republicans was 66% \u2014 5 percentage points higher than last year. But respondents were sharply divided over whether scientists should engage in policy debates on scientific issues, with 51% supporting an active role and 48% saying scientists should stay out of these debates.",
            "How can scientists make the most of the public\u2019s trust in them?",
            "This means that \u201cpeople want to trust the science but are not always sure they can trust the scientists\u201d to put personal biases aside when using their influence, says Arthur Lupia, a survey researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.",
            "The Pew report also found that only 45% of respondents think scientists are good communicators and 47% think scientists feel superior to others. Researchers who spoke to Nature say that the scientific community should accept that feedback, and act on it.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to discover something \u2014 it\u2019s another thing to explain it effectively,\u201d Lupia says. \u201cFor science to have public value, we actually have to do both of those things.\u201d",
            "To solve the communication conundrum, Oreskes says that scientific degree programmes should add more public-focused writing and speaking to their curricula. Mede suggests that scientists attend children\u2019s school science fairs, help with community-science projects and find other ways to speak to people face-to-face.",
            "\u201cThere is an important opportunity here for scientists, particularly those in government agencies,\u201d says Oreskes, \u201cto do an honest review of the ways in which their communications fell short during the pandemic, and consider how they can do better going forward.\u201d",

            "For the first time, researchers have used real-time data from around 40 million mobile phones to map conditions in the ionosphere \u2014 a region of the upper atmosphere in which some of the air molecules are ionized. Such crowdsourced signals could improve satellite navigation, especially in swathes of the world where data are otherwise scarce, including Africa, South America and South Asia.",
            "The proof-of-principle study, by a team at Google, was published in Nature on 13 November1.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing data set,\u201d says Anthea Coster, an atmospheric physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. \u201cIt fills in the map a lot, in areas where we desperately need more information.\u201d",
            "Phone data could reduce GPS errors by 10\u201320% in some areas, and more in underserved regions, estimates Ningbo Wang, an atmospheric physicist at the Aerospace Information Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Even with adjustments, interference from the ionosphere remains a challenge, he says, especially during solar storms that trigger uneven conditions in the ionosphere. \u201cThe results presented are truly impressive.\u201d",
            "h2Dual bands",
            "When the air is partly ionized, freely moving electrons slightly slow down the radio signals travelling to Earth from GPS and other navigation satellites. This can affect the nanosecond-precision timing that satellite navigation devices use to pinpoint their locations, with potentially serious impacts on aeroplane landings and autonomous vehicles.",
            "Real-time maps of the density of these electrons are commonly used to correct for fluctuations in the ionosphere. Engineers create the maps using data from ground-based receiver stations, which can detect the arrival times of two different frequencies of radio waves received from the same satellite. Electrons in the ionosphere slow down low-frequency waves more than they do high-frequency ones, by a nanosecond or so. This difference reveals the density of the electrons the wave passed through on its way to a receiver.",
            "Without these corrections, GPS would be out by around 5 metres, and by tens of metres during solar storms, when charged particles from the Sun can boost electron density. But many regions of the world lack the ground-based receiver stations used to make these maps.",
            "h2Noisy bonanza",
            "Although not all satnav devices can work at multiple frequencies, modern phones often do. Phone sensors also weren\u2019t previously thought to be viable for mapping the ionosphere, says Brian Williams, a computer scientist at Google in Mountain View, California, and a co-author of the study. This is because data from mobile phones are much noisier than are those from purpose-built scientific receivers, not least because they receive signals only intermittently and because the radio waves bounce off nearby buildings in built-up areas.",
            "The Google team succeeded in part thanks to the volume of data obtained. \u201cWhen combined in large numbers, the noise averages out and you still get a clear signal,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s like there is a scientific monitoring station in every city where there are phones.\u201d",
            "Anyone with an Android phone \u2014 and who allows Google to collect sensor data to improve location accuracy \u2014 was eligible to contribute to the study. But the data were aggregated such that individual devices are not identifiable, says the firm.",
            "Williams says that efforts are already under way to use this technique to improve location accuracy for Android users. But the data should also be useful for scientific studies of Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, he says. Already, the map has revealed bubbles in ionized gas, known as plasma, over South America that had not previously been observed in detail.",
            "For science to really benefit, Google will need to release the data, says Coster, who works on the Madrigal Database, a community resource for geospacer data that brings together ionosphere data from thousands of ground stations. A spokesperson for Google told Nature\u2019s news team that the data behind the study will be released alongside the paper, but there are currently no plans to provide fresh data in real time.",
            "Researchers are working on using other smartphone sensors in other ways. Google\u2019s Android Earthquake Alerts System in 2020 showed how accelerometers in people\u2019s phones could sense quakes and warn others who were yet to be hit. Apple users can access an app that uses similar technology. ",
            "Until now, scientists have thought of phones as end users of navigation services, says Wang. Flipping this on its head to use phone measurements as input data is \u201cnew territory\u201d, he says. \u201cThis paper marks an exciting shift.\u201d",
