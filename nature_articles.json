            "A first-of-its-kind blood test that uses biomarkers to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression could slash the time it takes to get an accurate diagnosis from years to weeks, according to the company that developed the test \u2014 but some scientists have raised concerns about its validity.",
            "The test uses biomarkers related to RNA editing to diagnose the condition and has been available in France since March and in Italy since October 2023, having been granted regulatory approval in both countries.",
            "Blood test uses \u2018protein clock\u2019 to predict risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases",
            "However, some researchers are concerned about the small size of the trials the test is based on and the lack of independent verification of the studies. The test\u2019s developer, the French start-up Alcediag in Montpellier, says that its trials are valid and reproducible. ",
            "The row highlights a wider discussion about the potential of biomarkers \u2014 biological characteristics that can indicate a particular medical state \u2014 to enable earlier diagnosis and more personalized treatments for psychiatric disorders.",
            "\u201cThere is a role for investigating biomarkers,\u201d says Suresh Sundram, a psychiatrist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cBut it is a very fraught area.\u201d",
            "h2Slow diagnosis",
            "Bipolar disorder, a spectrum of conditions characterized by mood swings that alternate between mania and depression, is difficult to diagnose. About 40 million people globally live with the illness, and the diagnostic process, which often involves multiple sessions with a psychiatrist, takes an average of seven to ten years, during which time people are often misdiagnosed with conditions such as depression and given inappropriate or ineffective treatments.",
            "Alcediag hopes to alter this grim landscape. The company says its \u20ac900 (US$980) blood test, EDIT-B, can help to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression using biomarkers. EDIT-B differentiates between the two by measuring subtle differences in RNA editing \u2014 a regulatory process that alters various cellular mechanisms, including the expression of genes, which in turn affects neurological functioning.",
            "Found: a brain-wiring pattern linked to depression",
            "Several studies have suggested that differences in RNA editing could play a part in autoimmune diseases and cancer, as well as in psychiatric conditions. In preliminary research, scientists at Alcediag identified distinct patterns of RNA editing affecting eight genes that seem to differ between healthy people and those experiencing depression. Among the depressed patients, six of these genes also show variations that distinguish people with depression from those with bipolar disorder. These differences produce a unique combination \u2014 or signature \u2014 of biomarkers that the company says it discovered using an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm it developed.",
            "\u201cWe have a signature for those with depression, a signature for the controls, and \u2026 one for bipolar,\u201d says Dinah Weissmann, co-founder and chief scientific officer of Alcediag. In a 2022 study involving 410 participants, the algorithm distinguished between the 160 people with depression and the 95 individuals with bipolar disorder with high accuracy1.",
            "About 80 people have used EDIT-B since its commercialization in France and Italy, says Weissmann, and feedback has been positive so far. She cites the anecdotal report of a person who, after receiving a positive test result, said they changed to more effective medication. \u201cThe patient wrote to their doctor: \u2018It\u2019s great, I\u2019m back on my feet. I\u2019m living normally again,\u2019\u201d says Weissmann.",
            "h2Potential risks",
            "For many people with bipolar disorder, a faster, more precise diagnosis would allow them to access \u201cthe right medication, at the right time\u201d, says Marion Leboyer, a psychiatrist and executive director of the FondaMental Foundation, a research organisation based near Paris.",
            "On the other hand, if a blood test gives an incorrect result, there is a risk that disorders could be misdiagnosed or overlooked, says Boris Chaumette, a psychiatrist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris. ",
            "There is no indication that an EDIT-B result has led to an incorrect diagnosis. But Chaumette and others are concerned about some of the methodology of studies used to demonstrate the EDIT-B test\u2019s effectiveness. He points to \u201cinherent limits\u201d to the 2022 study with 410 participants. \u201cYou take a data set with many variables and not many patients, and you ask an algorithm to classify people. It will inevitably find things that classify them, it will inevitably identify commonalities,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, what you observe could be the effect of treatments.\u201d",
            "Simple blood test detects eight different kinds of cancer",
            "He adds that, apart from the control group, every person involved in Alcediag\u2019s studies was taking medication (as is often the case with psychiatric research). These drugs could affect the levels of some biomarkers, says Sundram, \u201cso the algorithm could pick up the effect of the medicine\u201d.",
            "Weissmann says that the study participants with bipolar disorder and those with depression were taking a range of different medications, so if the algorithm was distinguishing people on the basis of their treatments, it would have classified them according to therapeutic classes. Stable patients \u2014 those who had a diagnosis but were not experiencing symptoms at the time of the study \u2014 also had a different biomarker signature from the control group, she adds, indicating that their medication suppressed symptoms without affecting markers of the underlying illness. She says that Alcediag\u2019s studies have involved hundreds of participants, and that the company is conducting a new clinical trial with 436 patients; they expect to publish the results next year.",
            "h2Replication questions",
            "Certain aspects of Alcediag\u2019s studies make it difficult for independent researchers to verify the work, says Chaumette. The algorithm and its underlying code haven\u2019t been shared, and follow-up studies run after the initial 2022 trial have used slightly different versions of the test. In a study the firm published this year, for example, it had removed one biomarker from the initial combination and added three new ones2.",
            "This issue led the French National Authority for Health (HAS), an independent body that assesses health products, to reject Alcediag\u2019s application for people taking the test to be reimbursed by the French health authorities. \u201cThere were variations in performance among the three versions, and we lacked the rationale to explain why this version was chosen and not another,\u201d says C\u00e9dric Carbonneil, who heads the HAS department responsible for assessing new medical devices and procedures. It is not unusual for companies at early stages of development to initially have their applications denied, and the HAS expects Alcediag to reapply, he adds. Alcediag says that it made changes to the biomarkers to improve the test\u2019s performance, and that it hasn\u2019t shared the algorithm for commercial reasons.",
            "Chaumette says he would have liked to see larger studies backing up the test before it was rolled out to patients, and he hopes Alcediag will make its technology available to independent groups to allow them to replicate the findings. \u201cIf you commercialize it rapidly and patent everything without sharing anything, then it becomes opaque.\u201d",

            "To unlock the secrets of human ageing, researchers might do better to look to the pet napping on their couch than to a laboratory mouse.",
            "As cats age, their brains show signs of atrophy and cognitive decline that more closely resemble the deterioration seen in ageing humans than do the changes in the brains of ageing mice, according to findings presented last month at the Lake Conference on Comparative and Evolutionary Neurobiology near Seattle, Washington.",
            "The results are part of a large project, called Translating Time, that compares brain development across more than 150 mammal species, and is now expanding to include data on aging. The hope is that the data will aid researchers trying to crack the causes of age-related diseases, particularly conditions that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
            "\u201cTo address challenges in human medicine, we need to draw from a wide range of model systems,\u201d says Christine Charvet, a comparative neuroscientist at Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine in Alabama, who presented the work. \u201cCats, lemurs, mice are all useful. We shouldn\u2019t focus all our efforts on one.\u201d",
            "h2Age in dog years",
            "The Translating Time project started in the 1990s as a tool for developmental biologists1. Project scientists compiled data on how long it takes for the brain to reach a range of developmental milestones in a variety of mammals and used these data to graph the relative development of two species over time. This can help researchers to link observations of animal development to the corresponding human age.",
            "Ageing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline",
            "Over the years, however, as Charvet presented these data at conferences, researchers kept asking her to extend the database to include not only early development, but also how the brain changes as animals age.",
            "Scientists have long been frustrated with the limitations of standard laboratory models when it comes to understanding human ageing and its impact on the unique human brain. Mice live for only a few years \u2014 not long enough to accumulate much of the damage thought to drive some neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Mice might also possess mechanisms that humans lack for clearing clumps of misfolded proteins called plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, says Melissa Edler, a comparative neurobiologist at Kent State University in Ohio.",
            "The evolutionary mismatch between mice and men could be one reason why efforts to develop therapies to treat the disease have often fallen flat, says Elaine Guevara, who studies primate evolutionary genetics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cMice don\u2019t develop the classic hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir brains are quite different to ours.\u201d",
            "h2Our pets, ourselves",
            "Companion animals could provide an alternative. They live longer than mice, share an environment with their owners and fall prey to human maladies, including obesity and diabetes. The Dog Aging Project, run by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and Texas A&M University in College Station, tracks tens of thousands of companion dogs to learn more about how their genetics, lifestyle and environment affect ageing.",
            "Does the human lifespan have a limit?",
            "But centuries of breeding have influenced ageing and disease in dogs, says Charvet. Cats often live a bit longer than dogs, she says, and are generally not as highly inbred for specific traits \u2014 some of which also raise disease risk.",
            "So Charvet and her colleagues have been gathering data from veterinary clinics and zoos, and launched an effort called the Catage Project that asks cat owners to submit data about their pets.",
            "So far, they have collected health records and results of blood sample analyses from thousands of felines and taken brain scans of more than 50. Using their own data and the published literature, the team is filling in events along the nonlinear relationship between cat and human ages. A one-year-old cat, for example, is roughly equivalent to an 18-year-old human. But in the next year, a cat ages only about 4 \u2018human years\u2019, to become about as mature as a 22-year-old person.",
            "By the age of 15, a cat is an octogenarian in human years. Some cats experience cognitive decline by then, and the brain scans collected by the team reveal brain volume changes in older cats that mirror those seen in older humans, says Charvet. Previous work has also shown that cats can accumulate plaques and tangles of abnormal proteins similar to those that characterize Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans.",
            "h2Multiple models",
            "Ultimately, researchers might develop a variety of model systems for different aspects of ageing and neurodegeneration, says Edler. Although mice are poor models for some aspects of human ageing, they will still be valuable, because it is so easy for researchers to conduct genetic experiments with the rodents, she says.",
            "Other animals, such as cats or certain nonhuman primates, might be better models for other aspects of brain ageing. Caleb Finch, who studies the evolution of life history at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, advocates more study of naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber), which live surprisingly long for small rodents and have very low rates of cancer.",
            "\u201cCats are useful,\u201d says Charvet. \u201cBut they\u2019re only going to be so useful. Other model systems are needed as well.\u201d",

            "Experimental evidence is accumulating, they say, that by improving soil health, crops can be made more resilient to drought and extreme weather \u2014 and they want governments to offer financial incentives to farmers who use \u2018regenerative\u2019 practices to climate-proof farmland. These agricultural practices include boosting the soil microbiome \u2014 that is, its microbial community \u2014 by rotating crops between fields, rather than repeatedly planting the same crop in the same field, and by adding \u2018cover crops\u2019 to fields. These comprise plants that won\u2019t necessarily be harvested, but that prevent soil erosion and boost soil nutrients.",
            "\u201cThere are lots of ripple effects from the changing climate that are creating challenges for our food system,\u201d says Rob Myers, the director of the Center for Regenerative Agriculture at the University of Missouri in Columbia. \u201cThe ways we combat that are with biological diversity, more organic matter in the soil \u2014 and more integrated approaches.\u201d",
            "But switching to such practices requires upfront investment. Researchers and farmers who spoke to Nature say that regenerative agriculture does work, but it can take a few years of implementing it before farms start to see a profit. In the United States, advocates are calling on the US Congress to include more subsidies for regenerative agriculture in the Farm Bill, a massive piece of legislation that is updated every five years or so and includes funding for disaster aid and farmer training. The most recent version expired on 30 September. Meanwhile, the latest version of the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy entered into force last year, and included funding for farmers using these types of sustainable practice.",
            "h2Nurturing the soil",
            "Industrial agriculture usually relies on fertilizers, pesticides and mechanical equipment to produce high-yielding monocultures \u2014 single crops such as maize (corn) or wheat. Excessive use of chemicals on these crops disrupts ecological processes in the soil and is one of the leading causes of water pollution in the United States. Unhealthy soil struggles to soak up water or retain nutrients.",

            "An estimated 8,505 million tonnes of topsoil on US farmland was lost to erosion between 2013 and 2017. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warns that more than 90% of Earth\u2019s soils are at risk of becoming degraded by 2050; this could lead to a rise in famine.",
            "Regenerative agriculture lacks a formal definition, but scientists who spoke to Nature say that its general goal is to rebuild healthy soil. That starts with increasing the proportion of organic matter \u2014 including living roots and manure \u2014 to feed the soil microbiome and recycle nutrients for plants. ",
            "Although the term is modern, regenerative principles are ancient. Implementing them means \u201creturning to some of the practices that we\u2019ve relied upon as a human species for thousands of years\u201d, says Rich Smith, an agricultural ecologist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.",
            "h2Keeping cover",
            "One practice that is considered regenerative is cover cropping: planting species that typically won\u2019t be harvested, such as crimson clover, when the cash crop is out of season instead of leaving the soil bare. Roots from the cover crop prevent erosion and take up excess nitrate from fertilizers that would otherwise leach into streams and groundwater. When a farmer cuts down the cover crop to prepare for the next round of cash-crop planting, they work it into the soil where it feeds the bacteria and invertebrates underground, improving soil fertility. Only about 5% of cultivated land in the United States was cover cropped in 2022, but that figure has been increasing: by 2022 it was 17% higher than in 2017.",

            "During a major drought that destroyed maize and soya bean crops across the US Midwest in 2012, Myers heard farmers say that cover-cropped fields hadn\u2019t been hit as hard as fields without the extra plants. So he worked with the Conservation Technology Information Center, a non-profit organization in West Lafayette, Indiana, that promotes conservation in agriculture, and a sustainable farming programme funded by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the National Cover Crop Survey. Researchers polled roughly 700 farmers, and found an average 9.6% greater maize yield and 11.6% greater soya bean yield during the drought on fields in which cover crops had been grown. ",
            "This was surprising, because \u201cat the time, many people thought that cover crops would take moisture away\u201d and not leave any for the cash crops, Myers says.",
            "The USDA has offered subsidies to farmers who use cover crops. Of the farmers who responded to the 2022\u201323 National Cover Crop Survey and had received payments to plant cover crops, 90% said that they would probably continue the practice after the funding stopped. ",
            "h2Valuing variety",
            "There is also evidence that crop rotation can improve soil health and resilience. Swapping out crops, rather than growing the same monoculture on the same field for years on end, can improve soil health without sacrificing productivity, Smith says.",
            "Eat less meat: will the first global climate deal on food work?",
            "This can be done by rotating different crops, including cover crops, on the same field over time, or by planting several crops on the same field at the same time, including the \u2018three sisters\u2019 trio of maize, beans and squash that has been grown by some Native American tribes for centuries. ",
            "A review of 20 studies that analysed the effects of crop rotation on soil life found that rotating various species increased the amount of microorganisms in soil by about 15% compared with monoculture fields, and boosted microbial diversity by more than 3%1. Rotating two or more different crops also generates more of the nutrients carbon and nitrogen in soil than does monoculture2. A review of 33 papers that assessed fields in which legumes and grains were grown together revealed an increase in the stability of yields year-to-year compared with those of monoculture fields3, suggesting that biodiverse farms could improve food security. ",
            "\u201cThose types of systems can often be more resilient to weather variation and have some enhanced disease resistance,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe evidence is relatively strong that they maintain, if not increase, yields.\u201d ",

            "Federal, state and business programmes that incentivize cover cropping usually stop after farmers make the transition. To support producers supplying the nation\u2019s food who institute these practices over the long term, the US Farm Bill should include a measure to reduce farmers\u2019 federal crop insurance premiums, Kaufman and others say. The USDA trialled this idea during the COVID-19 pandemic by offering farmers who planted cover crops an insurance discount of US$5.00 per acre. The federal programme has now ended, but states including Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois have implemented their own versions.",

Kevin Patrick, a scientific-image sleuth known as Cheshire on social media, has demonstrated just how easy it can be and posted his results on X. Using Photoshop\u2019s AI tool Generative Fill, Patrick created realistic images \u2014 that could feasibly appear in scientific papers \u2014 of tumours, cell cultures, Western blots and more.

            "Yoav Shechtman at the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, the tool\u2019s creator, says that the tool is helpful for producing training data for models because high-resolution microscopy images are difficult to obtain. But, he adds, it isn\u2019t useful for generating fake because users have little control over the output. Existing imaging software such as Photoshop is more useful for manipulating figures, he suggests.",

            "Two years ago, after more than 190 countries at a United Nations summit made a historic pledge to protect the world\u2019s species, questions arose about whether they could afford to keep that promise. At the latest meeting \u2014 held in Cali, Colombia, over the past two weeks \u2014 fights about conservation funding took centre stage, with little resolution.",
            "Can the world save a million species from extinction?",
            "But there were some bright spots. One was that negotiators approved an agreement that paves the way for large companies to pay for the use of digital genetic information extracted from nature, if it generates profit. For instance, a highly profitable agribusiness in the United Kingdom might use a digital DNA sequence from a plant found in Brazil to improve a crop. Under the agreement, that business will be encouraged to pay 1% of its profits or 0.1% of its revenue into a fund that could help countries such as Brazil to pay for conservation. ",

            "Yet many researchers were frustrated by what they saw as a lack of progress at COP16. By the close of the summit, only 44 of the 190-plus countries that signed the biodiversity deal two years ago had submitted action plans. And although around US$163 million was pledged in Cali to protect and restore nature, that amount is well short of the $200 billion per year that nations agreed will be needed to attain the goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s land and seas by 2030. ",
            "With nations not yet spending the sums required, there is growing pressure to seek funding from the private sector.",

            "The idea is that companies could purchase biodiversity credits to improve their reputation, to ensure their own survival if they rely on nature-based products and to offset any harm that they are doing to Earth\u2019s species with their operations. The credits would, in turn, pay for conservation projects globally.",
            "How biodiversity credits could help to conserve and restore nature",
            "During COP16, the International Advisory Panel on Biodiversity Credits (IAPB) \u2014 a group of 25 specialists in business, conservation and finance from around the world \u2014 published its guidelines on how to establish and scale up the scheme. But the release was met with criticism.",
            "The plan has been compared with carbon credits, which companies can purchase to offset their release of greenhouse-gas emissions. Carbon credits have been derided for potential links to human-rights violations and for generating profits for intermediary businesses that sell the credits while failing to actually reduce emissions.",
            "\u201cGovernment donations are the only thing that\u2019s put significant amounts of money towards nature, and those efforts are getting diminished by talk of selling biodiversity credits, which are convoluted, unproven and have no demand,\u201d says Brian O\u2019Donnell, director of the environmental-advocacy organization Campaign for Nature, who is based in Durango, Colorado.",
            "According to a December 2023 report from the World Economic Forum, if biodiversity credits gain traction quickly like carbon credits, global demand for them could reach $2 billion per year by 2030 and $69 billion by 2050.",
            "IAPB member Simon Zadek, chief executive of NatureFinance \u2014 a non-profit organization in Geneva, Switzerland, that is working to increase the role of finance in conservation \u2014 argues that the \u201cdisgrace\u201d of voluntary carbon markets provides lessons that will make it possible to design a biodiversity-credit market that works. ",
            "For instance, says Zadek, the panel has recommended that there should be no secondary trading of biodiversity credits, as is done by intermediary companies in the carbon market. Instead, the panel proposes a national model in which businesses that damage nature are taxed by their government. The proceeds would buy national biodiversity credits to fund 20\u201325-year nature-restoration programmes.",
            "If the IAPB does not push the creation of a market for biodiversity credits, \u201cthere is a real risk\u201d that private firms, including those already involved in the carbon market, will go it alone with no oversight, Zadek says. This would \u201cgenerate a mess\u201d.",

After confirming that sugar intake had risen dramatically after the rations lifted, the team mined the biobank for people who had been conceived between October 1951 and June 1954, when the rations were in effect. They then compared the health of these people with the health of people who were conceived between July 1954 and March 1956, after the rations were removed.",

The US Congress, which sets funding levels, passed a law in 2007 promising to do just that \u2014 but lawmakers didn\u2019t follow through.",
            "History is now repeating itself. In 2022, this time with an eye on China, Congress united to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized $280 billion to promote the domestic semiconductor industry and boost the budgets of several major research agencies. A key beneficiary of the legislation, the NSF, saw its budget increase by 11% to $9.9 billion in 2023 \u2014 only to fall back to $9.1 billion when Congress finalized this year\u2019s budget.",

Adams points out that the United States retains its lead in areas that it has invested in the most, such as biomedical research. By contrast, China is overtaking the United States in materials science, physical sciences and computer science, which are areas where US investments have fallen short.",
            "The question, come January, is whether the next president and Congress will work together to advance scientific funding commitments that both political parties have endorsed in the past. This depends in large part on who controls the two chambers of Congress, which is currently divided, with Democrats holding the Senate and Republicans having a majority in the House of Representatives.",
            "Biden seeks to boost science funding \u2014 but his budget faces an ominous future",
            "When it comes to setting spending priorities, Congress often goes its own way no matter what presidents propose in their budgets. For example, although previous president Donald Trump repeatedly sought to cut science budgets, it was during his tenure that Congress broke its own self-imposed budget caps and gave science agencies a significant boost in funding alongside the increases in defence spending sought by the Trump administration, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland.",
            "Today, lawmakers are once again operating under a budget agreement that seeks to cap overall spending until 2025, which could make it difficult to increase STEM spending, but it\u2019s unclear how that discussion will play out with a new president and Congress next year.",
            "\u201cI call it the whiplash effect,\u201d says Zeitzer. Funding agencies are constantly buffeted by shifting political winds that produce big promises \u2014 and occasionally big investments \u2014 before an inevitable swing back towards austerity. Half of the time, funding agencies are operating under provisional budgets and the looming threat of a government shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re supposed to be competitive if we\u2019re facing another 20 years of this,\u201d Zeitzer says.",

            "Questions about immigration and research security came to a head when Trump occupied the White House. First came the temporary travel ban that mainly impacted citizens from several Muslim-majority countries. Then a federal crackdown on academic espionage, dubbed the China Initiative, drew accusations of racism after ensnaring scholars with links to China, including many US citizens of Chinese descent.",
            "Biden ultimately ended both policies, but many scholars say they could make a comeback if Trump prevails in November. Last month, Trump vowed to reinstate his travel ban, and Republicans who control the US House of Representatives have approved legislation that would, if enacted, essentially reinstate the China Initiative.",
            "These tensions might be taking a toll: surveys in the United States have found that many Chinese researchers worry about prejudice after the China Initiative. A study6 published this year examined the propensity of Chinese students to enrol in US PhD programmes, compared with a control group of non-Chinese students. The two were in step until 2016, but the Chinese students became 15% less likely to enrol by 2019 \u2014 and more likely to enrol in non-US English-speaking countries. (The rapid drop of enrolments during the pandemic means that the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, can\u2019t reliably be extended to later years.)",

The Biden administration has been working to do just that under existing laws and regulations, she says, but it\u2019s ultimately up to Congress to increase the numbers of green cards that are available. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that Congress could do to solve this problem,\u201d Nice says.",

Allan Goodman, chief executive at the Institute of International Education in New York City, points out that the United States isn\u2019t the only country that is cracking down on immigration: Canada, the United Kingdom and others are doing much the same. This means fewer non-US options as international students consider where to forge their careers.",

Part of a broader trend towards increasing political polarization, these culture wars have engulfed campuses and led some lawmakers to impose limits on what university researchers can study and teach, and to curtail policies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion. The August NASEM report1 tapped into some of these sentiments, raising the fear that the United States\u2019 reputation is beginning to suffer abroad. \u201cSome of the nation\u2019s most important advantages in attracting and retaining talent are the intangibles: values, freedom, and opportunity,\u201d the report stated.",
            "Like Biden, vice-president and presidential candidate Kamala Harris would be expected to advance science-friendly budgets while continuing to emphasize the role of science in tackling climate change and promoting public health. By contrast, Trump and his appointees repeatedly undermined government scientists and agencies during his time in office, especially on issues such as climate change and public health.",
            "Many political scientists fear a second Trump term could be even more fraught for government researchers. Besides Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the results of any election he doesn\u2019t win and his promises to use the powers of the federal government for political retribution, researchers fear that he just might succeed in reshaping the US government by replacing thousands of federal scientists with obedient political appointees. This would further undermine the part that science plays in developing the rules and regulations that govern everything from greenhouse-gas emissions to drug development.",

It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neurological condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease.",
            "When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious molecule operates. \u201cThere was so much confusion in the field,\u201d Laflamme says.",
            "He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were advertised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them through their paces, only three performed well \u2014 meaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didn\u2019t even bind the key protein in Laflamme\u2019s testing. And those papers had been collectively cited more than 3,000 times1.",

Scientists have long known that many commercial antibodies don\u2019t work as they should \u2014 they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a \u2018reproducibility crisis\u2019 in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development.",

This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify specific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity \u2014 a strong affinity for the target \u2014 and selectivity \u2014 the ability to leave other proteins unmarked.",
            "For decades, scientists created these antibodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer-term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from animals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells. When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350 antibody suppliers around the world.",
            "In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies.",
            "What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from companies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collaborating. YCharOS\u2019s industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initiative (which include various non-profit organizations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published.",

The context in which antibodies are used can change how they perform.",

OMAPs are collections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging \u2014 a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs.",

In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by vendors to label specific products) \u2014 making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, it\u2019s important to have the right reagents \u2014 and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says.",
            "After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a company discontinues a product \u2014 and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this.",

            "In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000 journals have adopted policies that request these identifiers. \u201cWe currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers,\u201d says Bandrowski.",
            "Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. \u201cThat won\u2019t change reproducibility by itself, but it is the first step.\u201d",
            "In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies \u2014 and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOS\u2019s characterization data onto its site.",
            "\u201cThe big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many different species that you can\u2019t tick off that an antibody is good or bad,\u201d Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d Chalmers says.",

In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.",
            "When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didn\u2019t detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. \u201cThat was a shock,\u201d Virk says. \u201cAt that point, I wanted to leave science \u2014 because if things are really this unreliable, what\u2019s the point?\u201d",
            "Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders \u2014 such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers \u2014 to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first workshop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies. They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.",

It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester \u2014 the first outside Canada \u2014 which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.",
            "Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also altering the way some of their products are made.",
            "The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies generated by immune cells or immune\u2013cancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies4. Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells programmed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch \u2014 a key problem with the older methods.",
            "A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. \u201cFacilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improving reproducibility,\u201d says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. \u201cThat\u2019s something that antibody suppliers should be doing.\u201d",
            "Rob Meijers, director of the antibody platform at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant antibodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. \u201cThey\u2019re much more reproducible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive,\u201d he says.",

            "Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists\u2019 behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers don\u2019t want to hear that an antibody they\u2019ve been using for their experiments isn\u2019t actually doing what it\u2019s meant to, Williams says. \u201cIf somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, it\u2019s being used regardless, even if it\u2019s certain that it doesn\u2019t bind this protein,\u201d Williams says.

            "Pain-sensing nerves and immune cells work together to wreak havoc in endometriosis, a painful condition that affects an estimated 190 million women and girls of reproductive age. But a study in mice suggests a way to harness that interaction to treat the disorder1.",
            "The research, which was published on 6 November in Science Translational Medicine, reveals a key molecular pathway that not only promotes the sensation of pain caused by endometriosis, but also exacerbates the disease. Drugs that inhibit this pathway are already used for the treatment of migraines \u2014 the study\u2019s findings suggest that these therapies might be useful to treat endometriosis as well.",
            "\u201cThis is a new way of looking at how we could change pain pathways in endometriosis,\u201d says Louise Hull, a researcher who studies endometriosis and treats people with the condition at the University of Adelaide in Australia.",
            "h2Limited treatments",
            "Endometriosis occurs when cells similar to the lining of the uterus grow outside of the organ, sometimes causing pain, infertility and heavy menstrual bleeding. Current treatment options are limited. Hormonal medications can reduce symptoms in some people but not everyone can tolerate the side effects, and they are not useful for those who want to become pregnant. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used to relieve pain, but long-term use can damage the liver and kidneys. And the benefits of surgical treatments to remove endometrial deposits are often transient.",
            "The condition is also famously understudied, says Michael Rogers, a cancer researcher at the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts and an author on the study. \u201cCompared to other diseases that are similarly widespread and have a similar economic impact, endometriosis research is at least two \u2014 and probably three \u2014 orders of magnitude underfunded,\u201d he says.",
            "Rogers was recruited to the field by a member of his church whose family has been severely affected by endometriosis. Every month or two, she petitioned him: \u201cShe would say, \u2018Mike, you really need to start working on this disease.\u2019\u201d",
            "Eventually, she won him over. Rogers started following research in the field and, about nine years ago, began to develop the animal models he needed to investigate the condition.",
            "By then, researchers had already discovered that immune cells called macrophages probably contribute to endometriosis and that pain-sensing nerves are also involved2. Rogers and his colleagues found that disabling these nerves in mice with a condition similar to endometriosis not only dampened pain, as assesed by the animals\u2019 behaviour, but also reduced the size of lesions containing endometrial cells. \u201cThis strongly suggested that the pain-sensing nerves weren\u2019t just sensing pain, they were doing something to help the lesions grow,\u201d says study co-author Victor Fattori, a pharmacologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.",
            "h2Crosstalk",
            "The team decided to test whether a protein called CGRP, which aids communication between the nervous system and macrophages, might also have a role in endometriosis. Several drugs that block CGRP have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for other conditions, and the researchers administered four of these to mice that model endometriosis.",
            "Again, they saw a decrease in pain. Two of the drugs significantly reduced lesion size, and it's possible that higher doses of the other two medicines would have as well, says Rogers. ",
            "Clinical trials are needed to determine whether the same approach could be effective in people. Rogers is optimistic that such trials could begin soon: the drugs are already on the market and are considered relatively safe.",
            "Even so, it will be particularly important to demonstrate that they are safe for women who might want to become pregnant while taking the drug, says Hull.",
            "If shown to be safe and effective, CGRP-inhibiting drugs could fill a gap in care for people with endometriosis, says Erin Greaves, who studies the condition at the University of Warwick, UK, and who collaborates with Rogers. \u201cNew non-hormonal treatments for endometriosis are desperately needed.\u201d",

The method could help scientists to better understand nuclei\u2019s shapes, which, for example, influence the rate at which elements form in stars and help to determine which materials make the best nuclear fuel.",
            "\u201cThe shape of nuclei affects almost all aspects of atomic nucleus and nuclear processes,\u201d says Jie Meng, a nuclear physicist at Peking University in Beijing. The new imaging method, published in Nature on 6 November, is \u201cimportant and exciting progress\u201d, he says.",
            "Atomic nucleus takes two shapes",
            "A team at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, collided two beams of uranium-238 \u2014 and later, two beams of gold \u2014 at extreme energies. They hit them \u201cso hard that we basically melted the nuclei into a soup\u201d, says co-author Jiangyong Jia, a physicist at Stony Brook University in New York.",
            "The hot plasma produced by the collisions expanded under pressure very rapidly, in a way that was related to the nuclei\u2019s initial shape. By using a detector called Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC, or STAR, to find the momentum of each of the thousands of particles created by both types of collision and matching the results with models, the team could \u201croll back the clock to infer the shape of the nuclei\u201d, says Jia.",
            "h2Hidden figures",
            "An atomic nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons, which, like electrons, inhabit energy shells. Generally, the particles take on a shape that minimizes the energy of the system. Like a droplet of liquid, the nucleus can take on a variety of shapes, including that of a pear, American football or peanut shell. A nucleus\u2019s shape is \u201cvery hard to predict from theory\u201d, says Jia. It can also change over time owing to quantum fluctuations.",
            "Past experiments exploring shape involved deflecting low-energy ions off the nuclei. This method \u2014 called Coulomb excitation \u2014 excites the nuclei, and the radiation they emit as they fall back to the ground state reveals aspects of their shape. But the timescale is relatively long, so this kind of imaging can give only a long-exposure shot showing the average of any fluctuations in shape.",
            "\u2018The standard model is not dead\u2019: ultra-precise particle measurement thrills physicists",
            "By contrast, the high-energy collision method gives an instant snapshot of nuclei during impact. It is a more direct method, which makes it more suitable for studying exotic shapes, says Jia.",
            "The technique confirmed that gold had an almost spherical shape that was consistent from one image to the next. By comparison, uranium changed across the snapshots as the nuclei collided in different orientations. This allowed researchers to calculate the relative lengths of its nucleus in three spatial dimensions, indicating that uranium is not only elongated, but also slightly squeezed in one dimension, like a deflated American football.",
            "\u201cI find it fascinating that it worked\u201d and that other nuclear processes did not influence the particle emission and obscure the deformation, says Magdalena Zieli\u0144ska, a nuclear physicist at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission near Paris.",
            "h2Hard or soft?",
            "This kind of imaging could help with the challenging task of distinguishing between nuclei that are \u2018rigid\u2019, with well-defined shapes, and \u2018soft\u2019 fluctuating ones, says Zieli\u0144ska.",
            "Jia says his team would also like to apply the method to study the differences between lighter ions, such as oxygen and neon. Oxygen nuclei are nearly spherical, whereas neon nuclei \u2014 which carry an extra two protons and two neutrons \u2014 are thought to bulge out. Comparing their shapes would allow researchers to understand how protons and neutrons form clusters in the nuclei, says Jia.",
            "Information about shape can also reveal whether nuclei are likely to interact or undergo nuclear fission, and can boost the chance of detecting a process called neutrino-less double \u03b2 decay, which could help solve some long-standing mysteries in physics. Some 99.9% of visible matter resides in the centre of the atoms, says Jia. \u201cUnderstanding the nuclear building block is basically at the heart of the understanding who we are.\u201d",

They were also able to track patterns of genetic variation spread throughout the tree that offer clues about how it has adapted and evolved over the course of its lifetime. The findings were posted on the bioRxiv preprint server on 24 October1. The work has not yet been peer reviewed.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s just pretty cool to study such an iconic organism,\u201d says co-author Rozenn Pineau, a plant evolutionary geneticist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to draw people\u2019s attention on natural wonders of the world.\u201d",

Because of the way the plant reproduces, this collection of aspens is technically all one tree, supported by a single, vast root system. Pando is triploid, meaning that its cells contain three copies of each chromosome, rather than two. As a result, Pando cannot reproduce sexually and mix its DNA with that of other trees, and instead creates clones of itself.",
            "The trees\u2019 lessons: climate records are written in tree rings",
            "Although this process generates offspring that are genetically identical, they can still accumulate genetic mutations as their cells divide. Biologists are interested in these variations because they provide information on how the plant has changed since the first seedling sprouted. Some studies have explored the spread of new mutations in plants and fungi that reproduce clonally, but few have investigated centuries-old plants like Pando.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking to me that there hasn\u2019t been a lot of genetic interest in Pando already, given how cool it is,\u201d says study co-author William Ratcliff, an evolutionary biologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.",
            "The researchers collected samples of roots, bark, leaves and branches from across the Pando clone, as well as from other, unrelated quaking aspen trees for comparison. They extracted DNA from the samples, then sequenced and analysed a subsection of the genome.",
            "After removing variants that were found in both Pando and neighbouring trees, as well as mutations found in just one sample, the researchers were able to review nearly 4,000 genetic variants that had arisen as Pando cloned itself repeatedly over millennia.",
            "Analysing the patterns of these mutations revealed surprising results. \u201cYou would expect that the trees that are spatially close are also closer genetically,\u201d says Pineau. \u201cBut this is not exactly what we find. We found a spatial signal, but that is much weaker than what we expected.\u201d Physically close trees did share more similar mutations than those that were far apart \u2014 but only slightly more. However, over a smaller scale of 1\u201315 metres the trend was stronger, with stems that were closer together having significantly more shared mutations. Pando covers an area of more than 40 hectares, \u201cbut it almost looks like it\u2019s a well-mixed pot of genetic information\u201d, says Ratcliff.",
            "h2Protective mechanism",
            "By inputting Pando\u2019s genetic data into a theoretical model that plots an organism\u2019s evolutionary lineage, the researchers also estimated Pando\u2019s age. They put this at between 16,000 and 80,000 years. \u201cIt makes the Roman Empire seem like just a young, recent thing,\u201d says Ratcliff.",
            "The team also considered reasons for the tree\u2019s remarkable endurance. Pineau says that Pando being triploid might lead to \u201cbigger cells, bigger organisms, better fitness\u201d, and that existing clones might be more durable than new mixed offspring.",
            "Philippe Reymond, who researches interactions between plants and herbivores at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, says that the findings hint that \u201cplants and trees have a mechanism to protect the genome\u201d from the accumulation of harmful genetic mutations, a suggestion that is \u201cquite interesting for many scientists\u201d. He adds that future studies could search for this exact mechanism at the cellular level.",
            "Ratcliff is also keen for more studies to be done on Pando\u2019s genetic history. \u201cI would love to make a call for people to work on these kinds of organisms,\u201d he says.",
