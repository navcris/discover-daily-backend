            "Researchers have used artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover 70,500 viruses previously unknown to science1, many of them weird and nothing like known species. The RNA viruses were identified using metagenomics, in which scientists sample all the genomes present in the environment without having to culture individual viruses. The method shows the potential of AI to explore the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of the RNA virus universe.",
            "Viruses are ubiquitous microorganisms that infect animals, plants and even bacteria, yet only a small fraction have been identified and described. There is \u201cessentially a bottomless pit\u201d of viruses to discover, says Artem Babaian, a computational virologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. Some of these viruses could cause diseases in people, which means that characterizing them could help to explain mystery illnesses, he says.",
            "Previous studies have used machine learning to find new viruses in sequencing data. The latest study, published in Cell this week, takes that work a step further and uses it to look at predicted protein structures1.",
            "The AI model incorporates a protein-prediction tool, called ESMFold, that was developed by researchers at Meta (formerly Facebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, California). A similar AI system, AlphaFold, was developed by researchers at Google DeepMind in London, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this week.",
            "h2Missed viruses",
            "In 2022, Babaian and his colleagues searched 5.7 million genomic samples archived in publicly available databases and identified almost 132,000 new RNA viruses2. Other groups have led similar efforts3.",
            "But RNA viruses evolve quickly, so existing methods for identifying RNA viruses in genomic sequence data probably miss many. A common method is to look for a section of the genome that encodes a key protein used in RNA replication, called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). But if the sequence that encodes this protein in a virus is vastly different from any known sequence, researchers won\u2019t recognize it.",
            "Shi Mang, an evolutionary biologist at Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, China, and a co-author of the Cell study, and his colleagues went looking for previously unrecognized viruses in publicly available genomic samples.",
            "They developed a model, called LucaProt, using the \u2018transformer\u2019 architecture that underpins ChatGPT, and fed it sequencing and ESMFold protein-prediction data. They then trained their model to recognize viral RdRps and used it to find sequences that encoded these enzymes \u2014 evidence that those sequences belonged to a virus \u2014 in the large tranche of genomic data. Using this method, they identified some 160,000 RNA viruses, including some that were exceptionally long and found in extreme environments such as hot springs, salt lakes and air. Just under half of them had not been described before. They found \u201clittle pockets of RNA virus biodiversity that are really far off in the boonies of evolutionary space\u201d, says Babaian.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a really promising approach for expanding the virosphere,\u201d says Jackie Mahar, an evolutionary virologist at the CSIRO Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong. Characterizing viruses will help researchers to understand the microbes\u2019 origins and how they evolved in different hosts, she says.",
            "And expanding the pool of known viruses makes it easier to find more viruses that are similar, says Babaian. \u201cAll of a sudden you can see things that you just weren\u2019t seeing before.\u201d",
            "The team wasn\u2019t able to determine the hosts of the viruses they identified, which should be investigated further, says Mahar. Researchers are particularly interested in knowing whether any of the new viruses infect archaea, an entire branch of the tree of life for which no RNA viruses have been clearly shown to infect.",
            "Shi is now developing a model to predict the hosts of these newly identified RNA viruses. He hopes this will help researchers to understand the roles that viruses have in their environmental niches.",

            "Nobel prize season is always a time of excitement and speculation about potential winners, but it also brings criticism about the constraints imposed by the rules for the world\u2019s most prestigious scientific prizes. Is it, after all, realistic to expect the stipulations specified by Alfred Nobel 129 years ago to remain appropriate for science today?",
            "\n\nAI comes to the Nobels: double win sparks debate about scientific fields\n",
            "Although there is no shortage of scientific prizes, some of which (such as the US$3-million Breakthrough prizes) are more financially rewarding than the Nobels, none is yet afforded the same cultural status and prestige. So, if the Nobels were being launched today, would their formula need to be different?",
            "\u201cPersonally I would say the criteria for Nobel prizes would not have to be significantly modified, but remain effective in the way Alfred Nobel intended,\u201d says chemist Bengt Nord\u00e9n at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, who was chair of the chemistry Nobel Committee for three years.",
            "One obvious question is whether the categories of the awards adequately cover the core of scientific research. The Nobels are assigned loosely to the classical natural-sciences triumvirate of physics, chemistry and biology. But there is clearly some latitude in those boundaries. The physics awards have reached into fields including nonlinear dynamics and astronomy. The chemistry prizes, meanwhile, have ventured into Earth sciences, such as the 1995 prize for work on the ozone layer and atmospheric chemistry. This year\u2019s chemistry and physics prizes both centred on artificial intelligence (AI).",
            "h2Lack of maths",
            "G\u00f6ran Hansson, a physician at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and former vice-chair of the Nobel Foundation, argues that Nobel\u2019s archaic-sounding category of physiology or medicine remains more apt than a broader biology or life sciences, because these awards remain focused on either clinical medicine or biology relevant to humans (including, in 2022, human evolution).",
            "\n\nMedicine Nobel awarded for gene-regulating \u2018microRNAs\u2019\n",
            "Hansson points out that mathematics, which does not have a Nobel category, is well served by other awards, such as the Wolf Prize and the Fields Medal. But there is nothing, he says, to prevent a funder from proposing a new category that could be administered by the Nobel Foundation, as happened for the Nobel prize in economic science \u2014 which is awarded in memory of Alfred Nobel \u2014 launched by Sweden\u2019s central bank Sveriges Riksbank in 1969.",
            "Newer high-profile science prizes fill some of these gaps while leaving others open. For example, the $1-million Kavli prizes were launched in 2005 by the foundation established by entrepreneur Fred Kavli and are administered by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in Oslo. The prizes reward research in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience \u2014 which Kavli thought were \u201cthe most exciting fields for the twenty-first century and beyond\u201d. The Breakthrough prizes, founded by a group of technology entrepreneurs including Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg, give annual awards in fundamental physics, life sciences and mathematics.",
            "Perhaps the biggest source of controversy for the Nobel prizes is the restriction of three winners per category. Some argue that this doesn\u2019t reflect the way science has become highly collaborative since Nobel\u2019s day. But Hansson defends the constraint. \u201cThree is, needless to say, not a holy number. But there has to be a limit. And it forces us to work even harder to identify the true discoverers.\u201d",
            "h2Where does a team end?",
            "Prestigious awards \u201cmake researchers and research visible, shape careers and even create role models\u201d, says historian Nils Hansson at the Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany. He feels such recognition for individual researchers can be positive for science, and doubts that such benefits would follow if prizes were awarded to teams. Besides, he asks, \u201cwhere does an interdisciplinary and international team start and where does it end?\u201d",
            "Nord\u00e9n argues that opening up the prize to big teams \u201cwould dilute the impact\u201d. However, G\u00f6ran Hansson acknowledges that big science, especially particle physics, \u201cis a special case\u201d that complicates the picture.

We wanted to create a celebrity element in science\u201d.",

Although the Nobel Committee famously strives to be impervious to lobbying \u2014 G\u00f6ran Hansson argues that the geographical remoteness from \u201cmajor hubs of science\u201d helps the committee to resist such influences \u2014 Nils Hansson says that \u201cmarketing strategies and personal networks\u201d still matter in awards that, unlike in sports, are not decided on the basis of objective criteria2.",

            "h2Prize culture",
            "Whether a prize could be rationally designed to optimally reflect merit or acquire prestige remains an open question. Nils Hansson doubts whether enough is known about the sociological factors that govern the procedures for and consequences of awards to make it viable. \u201cThe understanding of prize cultures and their dynamics is still quite superficial,\u201d he says.",
            "\n\nPhysics Nobel scooped by machine-learning pioneers\n",
            "Do the constraints of the Nobels ever frustrate the committee? \u201cYes, of course,\u201d says G\u00f6ran Hansson. \u201cIt is frustrating that we can only award a fraction of all the important discoveries that are made. If we were to set up the Nobel Prize today, we might have chosen slightly different areas, or descriptions of areas.\u201d Another source of dissatisfaction is the extreme secrecy of the deliberations, meaning that \u201cwe have to remain silent when some of our decisions are questioned\u201d. And because that process typically takes a long time, \u201cit can be very sad when a candidate passes away before an award can be made\u201d, he adds.",
            "Still, G\u00f6ran Hansson argues that the Nobel prizes must be getting something right. \u201cHundreds of scientists apparently feel that hundreds of other scientists should be considered for each one of these awards.\u201d And the number of nominations has grown in the past 25 years. \u201cIf the Nobel prize categories were irrelevant in today\u2019s world, wouldn\u2019t one expect the opposite?\u201d",

This condition is caused by mutations in proteins called lamins, which are usually found at the periphery of cell nuclei. The researchers confirmed previous results suggesting that in individuals with progeria, these abnormal lamins intrude into the interior of the nucleus, where they seem to alter the typical arrangement of chromosomes and suppress gene activity. Similar abnormalities were present in skin cells from a 92-year-old donor who did not have progeria.",

            "Two researchers who developed tools for understanding the neural networks that underpin today\u2019s boom in artificial intelligence (AI) have won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics.",
            "John Hopfield at Princeton University in New Jersey, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto, Canada, share the 11-million Swedish kronor (US$1 million) prize, announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm on 8 October.",
            "Both used tools from physics to come up with methods that power artificial neural networks, which exploit brain-inspired, layered structures to learn abstract concepts. Their discoveries \u201cform the building blocks of machine learning, that can aid humans in making faster and more-reliable decisions\u201d, said Nobel physics committee chair Ellen Moons, a physicist at Karlstad University, Sweden, during the prize announcement. \u201cArtificial neural networks have been used to advance research across physics topics as diverse as particle physics, material science and astrophysics.\u201d",
            "h2Machine memory",
            "In 1982, Hopfield, a theoretical biologist with a background in physics, came up with a network that described connections between virtual neurons as physical forces1. By storing patterns as a low-energy state of the network, the system was able to re-create these patterns when prompted with something similar. It became known as associative memory, because the way in which it \u2018recalls\u2019 things is similar to the brain trying to remember a word or concept on the basis of related information.",
            "Hinton, a computer scientist, used principles from statistical physics, which collectively describes systems that have too many parts to track individually, to further develop the \u2018Hopfield network\u2019. By building probabilities into a layered version of the network, he created a tool that could recognize and classify images, or generate new examples of the type that it was trained on2.",
            "\n\nComputer science: The learning machines\n",
            "These processes differed from earlier kinds of computation, in that the networks were able to learn from examples, including from complex data. This would have been challenging for conventional software reliant on step-by-step calculations.",
            "The networks are \u201cgrossly idealized models that are as different from real biological neural networks as apples are from planets\u201d, Hinton wrote in Nature Neuroscience in 2000. But they proved useful and have been built on widely. Neural networks that mimic human learning form the basis of many state-of-the-art AI tools, from large language models to machine-learning algorithms capable of analysing large swathes of data, including the protein-structure-prediction model AlphaFold.",
            "Speaking by telephone during the physics-prize announcement, Hinton said that learning he had won the Nobel was \u201ca bolt from the blue\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted, I had no idea this would happen,\u201d he said. He added that advances in machine learning \u201cwill have a huge influence, it will be comparable with the industrial revolution. But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it\u2019s going to exceed people in intellectual ability\u201d.",
            "In recent years, Hinton has become one of the loudest voices calling for safeguards to be placed around AI. He says he became convinced last year that digital computation had become better than the human brain, thanks to its ability to share learning from multiple copies of an algorithm, running in parallel. \u201cIt made me think [that these systems are] going to become more intelligent than us sooner than I thought,\u201d he said on 31 May, speaking virtually to the AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva, Switzerland. \u201cUp until that point, I\u2019d spent 50 years thinking that if we could only make it more like the brain, it will be better.\u201d",
            "h2Motivated by physics",
            "Hinton also won the A. M. Turing Award in 2018 \u2014 sometimes described as the \u2018Nobel of computer science\u2019. Hopfield, too, has won several other prestigious physics awards, including the 2001 Dirac Medal.",
            "Hopfield\u2019s \u201cmotivation was really physics, and he invented this model of physics to understand certain phases of matter\u201d, says Karl Jansen, a physicist at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Zeuthen, who describes the work as \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d. After decades of development, neural networks have become an important tool in analyzing data from physics experiments and in understanding the types of transitions between phases that Hopfield had set out to study, Jansen adds.",

            "Lenka Zdeborov\u00e1, a specialist in the statistical physics of computation at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), says she was pleasantly surprised that the Nobel Committee recognized the importance of ideas from physics for understanding complex systems. \u201cThis is a very generic idea, whether it\u2019s molecules or people in society.\u201d",
            "In the past five years, the Abel Prize and Fields Medals have also celebrated the cross-fertilization between mathematics, physics and computer science, particularly contributions to statistical physics.",
            "Both Hopfield and Hinton \u201chave brought incredibly important ideas from physics into AI\u201d, says Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist who shared the 2018 Turing Award with Hinton and fellow neural-network pioneer Yann LeCun. Hinton\u2019s seminal work and infectious enthusiasm made him a great role model for Bengio and other early proponents of neural networks. \u201cIt inspired me incredibly when I was just a university student,\u201d says Bengio, who is scientific director of Mila \u2014 Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Montreal, Canada. For decades, many computer scientists regarded neural-network research as fruitless, says Bengio, but there was a turning point in 2012, when Hinton and others used the technology to win a major image-recognition competition.",
            "h2Brain-model benefits",
            "Biology has also benefited from these artificial models of the brain. May-Britt Moser, a neuroscientist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim and a winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, says she was \u201cso happy\u201d when she saw this year\u2019s Nobel physics winners being announced. Versions of Hopfield\u2019s network models have been useful to neuroscientists, she says, for investigating how neurons work together in memory and navigation. His model, which describes memories as low points of a surface, helps researchers to visualize how certain thoughts or anxieties can get fixed and retrieved in the brain, she adds. \u201cI love to use this as a metaphor to talk to people when they are stuck.\u201d",
            "\n\nTen computer codes that transformed science\n",
            "Today, neuroscience relies on network theories and machine-learning tools, which stem from Hopfield\u2019s and Hinton\u2019s work, to understand and process data on thousands of cells simultaneously, says Moser. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fuel for understanding things that we couldn\u2019t even dream of when we started in this field.\u201d",
            "\u201cThe use of machine-learning tools is having immeasurable impact on data analysis and our potential understanding of how brain circuits may compute,\u201d says Eve Marder, a neuroscientist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. \u201cBut these impacts are dwarfed by the many impacts that machine learning and artificial intelligence are having in every aspect of our daily lives.\u201d",

Their report was published today in Current Biology.",

There were no wildebeests near the site of the railway worker\u2019s camp, says co-author Alida de Flamingh, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The next step will be \u201cworking with the local community and the local institutions\u201d, Malhi says. \u201cThere are potentially descendants, or a descendant community that may or may not want this type of analysis done, or maybe they do \u2014 we just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",

            "It was January 2012, and Amepou was travelling down the delta by dinghy, from village to village, as part of a research project on the vulnerable pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta). Amepou heard talk of outsiders appearing across the region offering staggering amounts of cash for swim bladders \u2014 an organ cut from some of the delta\u2019s large fish species that helps them to control buoyancy. Consumers in Asia, particularly southern China, know this commodity as fish maw and covet it as a culinary delicacy, a traditional medicine and a symbol of prosperity.",
            "The global maw trade has been growing rapidly over the past 25 years1, and market prices now far exceed those of similar dried seafood luxuries such as shark fin and sea cucumber, which are also prized in China. In some low- and middle-income countries where demand for maw is very high, it is sometimes called the cocaine of the seas because it is so lucrative and attracts organized crime interests.",
            "Papua New Guinea has become the source of some of the most sought-after maw. In the years since Amepou\u2019s first visit, she\u2019s watched the fish-maw industry in the Kikori delta explode, \u201clike a fisheries gold rush\u201d. Fishers replaced their paddle canoes, lines and hooks with outboard-powered dinghies and commercial nets. The price being offered to delta fishers for dried maw from one prized species \u2014 the scaly croaker (Nibea squamosa) \u2014 has been recorded at up to US$15,615 per kilogram \u2014 potentially the highest price offered to fishers for maw in the world, according to a study by Amepou and her colleagues published earlier this year2.",

Its waterways and mangroves are recognized as a sanctuary of biodiversity and have been nominated for inclusion as a World Heritage Site on the list maintained by the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO.",
            "Grant and others fear that the sharp increase in fishing pressure in the Kikori delta and the use of gillnets \u2014 which indiscriminately capture many types of fish, dolphin and turtle \u2014 could recreate problems that have plagued Mexico, China and parts of Africa, where the maw trade has fished some species into near oblivion. That threat risks damaging the delta\u2019s ecosystems and leaving people worse off, says Grant.",

Along with Grant and other members of a species-survival commission that is part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), she contributed to a paper sounding the alarm on the increasing maw trade that was submitted by the United States to a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in July.",
            "\u201cThere are very few controls and there is very little knowledge, I think, by the government fishery departments about the value, importance and potential threats of this,\u201d says Sadovy.

In her early years in the Kikori region, she was focused on how hunting and habitat changes were threatening the pig-nosed turtle. The work took her to far-flung villages to monitor nesting sites, survey the consumption of turtle meat and eggs, and build community awareness about the vulnerability of the creatures known as piku.",
            "By 2019 she was known locally as mama piku, and was the director of a small conservation organization, the Piku Biodiversity Network, which she still runs.

With support from the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), a multinational organization focused on the region\u2019s natural resources, they collected data on targeted maw species, as well as by-catch. A survey of landings in gillnets reported by fishers from five delta communities over six months to April 2022 found that the hunt for fish maw pulls up huge numbers of non-target fish and mammals3.",
            "Elasmobranchs \u2014 a subclass of fish that includes sharks and rays \u2014 accounted for almost half the catch, whereas target species made up just 22%. Among the other casualties were several species listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, including three species of hammerhead shark, the giant guitarfish (Glaucostegus typus) and the bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae), alongside various vulnerable river sharks and critically endangered Indo-Pacific sawfishes (Pristidae)2.",
            "Other reports, some unpublished, document declines in two endemic dolphin species that have small local populations and are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. On one occasion, fishers reported that ten dolphins drowned in a single net, says Amepou. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the very real possibility of a local extinction if nothing is done about the gillnets in the water,\u201d she says.",
            "But discussions with local people about curtailing fishing practices for conservation purposes are acutely sensitive given the money flowing into the economically disadvantaged region. \u201cWhile local fishers acknowledge sustainability concerns, the overarching feeling is everyone is pretty happy for now,\u201d says Grant. \u201cWhether fish-maw money is going back into community and development remains to be seen, and this is our next research focus.\u201d",
            "In 2022, the researchers submitted a report to SPREP on the Kikori maw fishery, urging the development of a management plan3. Sources have told Nature that work on a plan has commenced, but Papua New Guinea\u2019s authorities did not respond to questions from Nature on its progress. In 2021, the National Fisheries Authority stopped issuing new fish-maw licences in Gulf Province, where the Kikori delta is located, and in the neighbouring Western Province, owing to increasing illegal, unregulated and unreported activities in the two fisheries.",

            "After storm surges destroyed many houses in the delta village of Veraibari in 2020, the people formed a relocation committee. They plan to use the windfall maw money to build around 200 homes, a school, a market and churches a short distance inland from the beach where they currently live. The committee estimates that this plan will cost 1,689,000 Papua New Guinean kina (US$431,000). In recent years, waves have damaged and closed the schoolhouse, knocked down freshwater tanks and submerged burial grounds. Abandoned homes decay on their stilts in the shallows alongside the stumps of drowned palm trees.",

            "Kouwo is also the local agent buying maw for one of the six seafood companies, all Asian-led, with licences in Gulf Province. He conducts business at his family table, weighing and trading fish maw, offering 5,000 to 6,000 kina per 100 grams for the finest specimens. He kicked off the relocation fund with his own earnings, urging his neighbours and relatives to provide cash or other contributions. They are lobbying for more government support, but have so far received only sandbags to build a seawall, which soon failed, and some iron roofing, nails and a sawmill to help with the relocation. Money earned from fishing is the only way to save the village, he says, although he recognizes the risks.",

She and others urged authorities in Hong Kong, the global trade hub for maw, to introduce a specific code for fish maw separate from other dried fish, which they did in 2015. Data collected using this new code revealed that between 2015 and 2018, 3,144\u20133,882 tonnes of dried maw, worth $264 million to $394 million, were imported to Hong Kong every year4. These were shockingly high numbers, Sadovy says, \u201cbecause you might have 3,000 tonnes of maw, but maw is only 5% of the weight of the animal. So that\u2019s tonnes and tonnes of animal, so you begin to think about the scale of those fisheries\u201d.",

In 2021, in response to the high prices being paid for maw in Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, India and French Guiana, the IUCN adopted a motion urging nations to control and monitor trade in the swim bladders of a group of ray-finned fishes known as big croakers to both protect the target species and reduce by-catch of threatened marine megafauna.",
            "\u201cA lot of people are beginning to realize \u2014 biologists, fisheries people \u2014 that maw is an issue,\u201d says Sadovy. However, she adds that there are also a lot of places where the maw trade operates out of sight. Concerns about the trade are what motivated the drafting of the document submitted by the United States to CITES in July, she says. \u201cIt was a first initiative to highlight international maw trade as an issue threatening some species.\u201d",
            "\n\nRewilding the planet: how seven artificial islands could help a dying Dutch lake\n",
            "Sadovy hopes escalating concern will persuade international organizations \u2014 in particular, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN \u2014 to become more active in documenting the trade. She wants to see the FAO follow Hong Kong\u2019s lead and introduce a commodity code specifically for maw. \u201cThere are opportunities to actually seek better benefits for the fishermen themselves,\u201d says Sadovy. \u201cI see a win\u2013win before some species are really pushed too far down.\u201d But it needs to happen soon.",
            "Without action at national and international levels, researchers warn that the risks for both vulnerable marine populations and the people who rely on them for income and food are dire. In the dozen years she has been working in the Kikori delta, Amepou has observed how precarious life is in the villages and how much the people there are exposed to the rapidly changing environment. She hears their stories and tries to answer questions about rising seas, changing weather and vanishing species.",
            "Amepou likes to take the conversation back to the creature that drew her to the region: the turtle with the snout of a pig, remarkable enough to etch its way into local lore. When she first arrived, the people of the delta told her they had no concerns for its future, because the pig-nosed turtle was like their mother. It would always provide for them.",
            "\u201cAnd I say \u2018your mother will provide for you to a certain point. There\u2019s a time in life when you have to take care of your mother\u2019,\u201d Amepou says. \u201c\u2018And it\u2019s come to that point, where your mother kind of needs your help.\u2019\u201d",

            "Nobel prize: check. Medical revolution: still pending.",
            "It took 30 years for a Nobel prize committee to recognize the discovery of tiny RNA molecules that regulate gene activity in our cells. Turning those beguiling \u2018microRNAs\u2019 into medicines, however, will take even longer.",
            "On 7 October, this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to two scientists who found and characterized microRNAs for the first time in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Since that discovery in 1993, researchers have unearthed hundreds of microRNAs in the human genome \u2014 some with tantalizing potential applications, such as treating cancer or preventing heart disease.",
            "But so far, no microRNA-based drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, an agency that many countries look to for guidance. The field has hit \u201ca little bit of a slump\u201d, says Frank Slack, who studies microRNAs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts.",
            "That could be about to change: \u201cThe promise is there. The technology is getting better,\u201d Slack says. \u201cAnd the attention from the Nobel prize is really good \u2014 this will drive interest again.\u201d",
            "h2Expanding ambitions",
            "Treating disease was not on Slack\u2019s mind when he first encountered microRNAs as a postdoctoral fellow in the 1990s. Then, he was working in Garry Ruvkun\u2019s laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he, Ruvkun and others co-discovered the second-known microRNA, a molecule called let-7, also in roundworms1. Ruvkun shared this year\u2019s medicine Nobel with Victor Ambros at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worcester.",
            "\n\nMedicine Nobel awarded for gene-regulating \u2018microRNAs\u2019\n",
            "In the 1990s, researchers were interested in microRNAs because they represented a new way of regulating gene activity, Slack says. But ambitions expanded when he and his colleagues realized that let-7 was also a part of the human genome2, and might help to prevent cancer3. \u201cWe really started to think that this might have a medical application,\u201d says Slack. \u201cThe first clinical trial came very quickly after that.\u201d",
            "Maybe a little too quickly, he adds.",
            "That first trial investigated a microRNA similar to let-7, called miR-34, that also held the potential to stave off cancer. Studies in mice with lung cancer showed that administering a molecule similar to miR-34 early in the disease could slow tumour growth4. But at the time, researchers knew little about how to cloak RNA medicines to keep them from provoking a dangerous immune response, or how best to deliver them to the right spot in the human body.",
            "As a result, says Slack, clinicians had to administer unusually high doses of the experimental drug into the bloodstream of trial participants. This triggered an immune response, and four people died. The trial was stopped.",
            "h2Disappointments abound",
            "Since those early days, researchers in academia and industry have learned how to package or modify RNA molecules so that they can be delivered to certain organs safely and at lower doses, says Anastasia Khvorova, a chemical biologist at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School.",
            "\n\nScientists are waiting longer than ever to receive a Nobel\n",
            "But the miR-34 trial wasn\u2019t the only disappointment along microRNA\u2019s path to becoming a medicine. Another came when researchers at the San Diego, California, site of Santaris Pharma tested a therapy designed to reduce the expression of a human microRNA that is commandeered by the hepatitis C virus to infect liver cells. Early results in people with chronic hepatitis C virus infections seemed positive5. \u201cIt was a milestone,\u201d says Sakari Kauppinen, who studies RNA-based medicine at Aalborg University\u2019s campus in Copenhagen, and worked on the team at Santaris.",
            "But as the researchers were celebrating, another company announced that it had developed a more conventional treatment for hepatitis C. Fearing that it could not compete, Santaris abandoned the microRNA approach, Slack says.",
            "Despite those false starts, there is every reason to expect that microRNA-based medicines will have their day, Khvorova says.",
            "Researchers are developing microRNA-based therapies to treat epilepsy, obesity and cancer. In March, in a sign of confidence in microRNAs, the pharmaceutical firm Novo Nordisk in Bagsvaerd, Denmark, agreed to pay up to \u20ac1.025 billion (US$1.12 billion) to purchase a company called Cardior Pharmaceuticals in Hannover, Germany. Cardior is conducting a phase II clinical trial of a microRNA inhibitor designed to treat heart failure.",
            "h2Tipping point ahead?",
            "Another reason to expect success for microRNAs is that other drugs based on RNA have been approved and work through very similar mechanisms, Khvorova says. Those drugs, several of which are designed to treat genetic disorders such as hereditary high cholesterol, rely on a technique called RNA interference to reduce the activity of a target gene. One difference between them and microRNAs, however, is that microRNAs are made naturally by the body and often affect the activity of many genes, Khvorova adds. This means that careful laboratory studies will be necessary to ensure that boosting or suppressing a natural microRNA won\u2019t have unwanted side effects.",
            "\n\nDo the microRNAs we eat affect gene expression?\n",
            "Over the years, those microRNA data have been accumulating, says Khvorova, and the field might be nearing a tipping point. \u201cIt\u2019s lagging behind, but it\u2019s coming,\u201d she says. \u201cI am confident that there are several programmes that are likely to generate drugs.\u201d",
            "In the meantime, Slack, who has advised and founded several companies involved in developing microRNA therapies, has returned years later to miR-34. Armed with better methods for delivering the treatment in the body, he\u2019s hopeful that the microRNA\u2019s ability to simultaneously affect multiple genes that have a role in protecting against tumours could help to treat particularly recalcitrant cancers, such as pancreatic cancer.",

            "An investigation into academic hiring outcomes for biological-science roles has suggested a surprising trend: women who applied for assistant professor positions in North America were more likely to get job offers than were men.",
            "The findings, published on the bioRxiv preprint server1, have not been peer reviewed. Still, they offer a sign that the academic job market might be making progress towards equity in hiring, says co-author Nafisa Jadavji, a neuroscientist at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.",
            "Jadavji and her co-authors surveyed 449 researchers, of which 89% were from the United States, who applied for positions between 2019 and 2022. The team then built a computer model to identify the factors that predicted success or failure.",
            "Overall, women were at an advantage. Two-thirds of women in the sample received at least one job offer compared with half of the men. The advantage is particularly notable because men had slightly more first-author publications in highly ranked journals. \u201cMen had a few more CNS [Cell, Nature, Science] papers, but women were getting more job offers,\u201d Jadavji says.",
            "\n\nWhat\u2019s the state of hiring researchers in science? Share your insights with Nature\n",
            "However, there were some negative trends. Researchers who had completed several postdoc positions were the least likely to receive an offer. Older applicants, first-generation scholars (those whose parents didn\u2019t go to university) and applicants who were residents of countries outside North America were also less likely to find success.",
            "Jadavji says the apparent advantage for women is somewhat unexpected, given the gender imbalance at higher levels of academia and the \u201cleaky pipeline\u2019 that continues to remove women from the academic career path. \u201cWe know that women are taken out of the job market at every level of science training,\u201d she says.",
            "The finding that women in this sample were more likely to receive job offers than were men was \u201cpleasant to see\u201d, says Yvette Pearson, a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education researcher and the former vice-president of diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cIt\u2019s less surprising in the biological sciences, where we see a larger number of women completing undergraduate and graduate degrees. I\u2019d like to see this in engineering, computer science and other STEM disciplines.\u201d",
            "The study found that men and women were equally likely to be offered on-site job interviews, but women were more successful at turning those interviews into offers. That might be partly because men are more likely than women to apply to jobs even if they don\u2019t meet all of the required qualifications, Pearson says. \u201cWomen might go into interviews with a higher level of confidence,\u201d she adds, because, in reality, they have stronger CVs.",
            "Pearson co-authored a 2023 paper2 in the International Journal of STEM Education that looked at the qualifications and characteristics that are deemed important by faculty members and administrators during the hiring process. That study found that qualifications related to research \u2014 including institutional prestige, postdoctoral experience and publications \u2014 were more important when evaluating tenure-track applicants. By contrast, qualifications and qualities related to diversity, equity and inclusion (such as a proven ability to work with people of different genders, races and ethnicities) took on more importance when hiring for non-tenure-track teaching positions.",
            "Michael Yassa, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, says that the bioRxiv study provides an interesting snapshot of a crucial part of the hiring process. He co-authored a 2023 report3 in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) Journal that detailed successful efforts at his institution to diversify faculty recruitment in the field of biomedical sciences. Among other things, his institution took steps to ensure greater gender balance in hiring committees.",
            "\n\nWhite men still hold majority of US science and engineering jobs\n",
            "Women who do land a faculty job continue to face obstacles in promotion and leadership opportunities, Yassa says. \u201cEven if hiring is equal, every step onwards is disproportionately challenging for women and under-represented minorities.\"",
            "In the bioRxiv study, the race and ethnicity of applicants had no apparent bearing on the chances of receiving a job offer. Jadavji cautioned that only about 10% of respondents identified as Black, Hispanic or members of another under-represented minority.",
            "When it comes to job applications, the more the better, Jadavji says. \u201cThe number of applications you submit plays a major role in the number of offers you receive,\u201d Jadavji says. In this sample, the sheer volume of applications \u2014 ranging from one to 96 per person \u2014 was the most reliable predictor of success.",
            "Pearson says that 96 applications is probably overkill for any particular job search, but she does see a lesson in the findings: applicants shouldn\u2019t skimp on their opportunities. \u201cMy advice is to apply to every position that meets your qualifications and your interests,\u201d she says.",
            "The finding that completing several postdoc positions can lower the chances of a job offer might be unwelcome news for many junior researchers who have spent years trying to land a tenure-track role.",
            "\u201cThe general advice, especially in biomedical sciences, is that you have to do a number of postdocs\u201d to be competitive for a faculty position, Jadavji says. \u201cBut if you stay too long, you may become undesirable.\u201d",
            "Junior researchers who are in their second or third postdoc position shouldn\u2019t necessarily despair, Yassa says. Instead, they should continue to work towards awards, publications and other accomplishments that can reassure hiring committees. \u201cThey need to show that they have the potential to launch a successful research programme,\u201d he says.",
            "Jadavji plans to continue studying job applicants to get a clearer picture of the factors that determine success in academia. Hiring departments are ultimately looking for someone who is a good fit, which is a difficult quality to measure, she says.",
            "\u201cWe've recruited social scientists to our team to start looking at the qualitative experience of being on the faculty job market,\u201d Jadavji adds. \u201cThere are a lot of factors to consider.\u201d",
