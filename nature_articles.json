            "For the first time, researchers have accelerated muons \u2014 the heavier, unstable cousins of electrons \u2014 into a tightly controlled beam, bringing the vision of a muon collider a step closer to reality. ",
            "A team at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai shot a laser at a stream of muons to bring the fast-moving particles to a near-standstill. Then, the researchers applied an electric field to accelerate these \u2018cooled\u2019 muons to around 4% of the speed of light. The findings, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, were posted on 15 October on the arXiv preprint server1.",
            "The feat is a \u201cgreat step forward\u201d in the approach needed to build a muon collider, which could be used to make the exquisitely sensitive measurements required to uncover new physics but be smaller and potentially cheaper to build than other particle colliders, says Tova Holmes, a particle physicist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. ",
            "Muons are short-lived fundamental particles that are almost identical electrons, but with more than 200 times the mass. Over the past decade, there has been growing momentum towards building a compact muon collider that could match or exceed the energies achieved by sprawling proton and electron colliders, such as the 27-kilometre Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Europe\u2019s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. A 10-kilometre muon collider could produce particles that have as much energy as those from a 90-kilometre proton machine, because muons are fundamental particles, which means all of their energy goes into each collision. On the other hand, proton collisions occur between their constituent quarks.",
            "h2Tricky particles",
            "But muons are fiendishly difficult to accelerate because they only exist for around 2 microseconds before they decay into an electron and two types of neutrino. They also dart around in different directions at various speeds, making them difficult to tame into a narrow, high-intensity beam. Although researchers have accelerated muons before, the beams \u201care highly divergent\u201d, says study co-author Shusei Kamioka, a particle physicist at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Tsukuba, Japan. As a result, the beams are too unruly to be used for sensitive measurements.",
            "To overcome this roadblock, Kamioka and his colleagues shot a beam of positively-charged muons, the antimatter counterpart of muons called antimuons, into silica aerogel \u2014 a sponge-like material that\u2019s often used as a thermal insulator. When the positive muons hit electrons in the aerogel, neutral atoms of \u2018muonium\u2019 formed. The researchers fired a laser at these atoms to strip away their electrons, turning them back into positive muons that were almost frozen in place. This cooling process made the particles\u2019 speeds and directions uniform.",
            "Next, the researchers used an electric field to accelerate these slowed-down muons to an energy of 100 kiloelectronvolts, achieving a speed of around 4% that of light.",
            "Although the results are promising, there\u2019s still a long way to go before muon colliders will become a reality, says Holmes. The approach would need to be scaled up to produce even tighter, higher-intensity beams, she says.",
            "Kamioka said he and his colleagues are developing the technology needed to accelerate muons to 94% of the speed of light, and hope to achieve this by 2028. \u201cThat is our next milestone,\u201d he says.",
            "Besides building a future collider, physicists could use high-energy muon beams in experiments that could go beyond the standard model of particle physics, such as precisely measuring the muon\u2019s mysterious magnetism \u2014 which has shown to be stronger than predicted by theory, says Kamioka.",

By contrast, Trump and his appointees repeatedly undermined government scientists and agencies during his time in office, especially on issues such as climate change and public health.",

Besides Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the results of any election he doesn\u2019t win and his promises to use the powers of the federal government for political retribution, researchers fear that he just might succeed in reshaping the US government by replacing thousands of federal scientists with obedient political appointees.

For animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature, called ectotherms, the difference is smaller. For the pampas snake (Tomodon dorsatus), for example, the value is around four times more. And for a species of seawater fish called the capelin (Mallotus villosus), it is twice more.",

Overall, the team collated enough data to calculate the indirect and direct costs of reproduction for 81 species, ranging from microscopic animals called rotifers to fishes, snakes and humans.",

They used this to estimate the extra energy required during nine months of pregnancy \u2014 the indirect costs \u2014 and combined that with estimated direct costs, such as the total energy content of a newborn baby.",

It\u2019s not surprising that such measurements are rare in the literature, says Marshall.",
            "Instead, modellers have found it easier to calculate the energy stored in offspring \u2014 by simply estimating the amount of bone, fat and protein in the bodies of offspring and combining that with the known energy content of those components.

It will take time to make these revisions, says Marshall, because rewriting the models is not straightforward. But, in turn, this could shift the weight of evidence behind some theories as to why animals live the way they do, such as whether fish hit a maximum body size to conserve energy for reproduction, he says.",
            "Fresh estimates for reproductive energy use could also improve predictions of how species will evolve amid climate change, says Audzijonyte. This is because predictive models take into account factors such as the energy demands of reproduction, how heat alters the speed of reactions inside animals\u2019 bodies and how big animals grow.",

In future, studies that measure the indirect costs of reproduction throughout the entire gestation period will be needed, he says.",

Three of the researchers behind some of these tools were awarded this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their efforts. The accolades come, in part, from the hope that newly created proteins could serve as more-effective drugs, industrial enzymes or laboratory reagents.",

This latest crop of competitions is drawing people from around the world into the related field of protein design by lowering the barrier to entry. It could also quicken the pace of validation and standards development and perhaps help to foster community. \u201cIt will push the field forward and test methods more quickly,\u201d says Noelia Ferruz Capapey, a computational biologist at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain.",

            "h2Competitive by design",
            "The protein-design contests are partly inspired by a 30-year-old competition that helped to kick off the revolution in biological AI. Since 1994, the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) has been challenging scientists to predict the 3D shape of proteins from their amino-acid sequences. Winners of the competition \u2014 founded by computational biologist John Moult at the University of Maryland in Rockville and Krzysztof Fidelis, a computational biologist at the University of California, Davis \u2014 are determined by comparing the computational predictions with unpublished structural models.",
            "In 2018, London-based DeepMind (now Google DeepMind) won CASP with its first version of the protein-structure-prediction tool AlphaFold. Its next iteration, AlphaFold 2, performed so well in 2020 that Moult declared the problem of predicting simple protein structures largely solved. The competition has since shifted its focus to other emerging challenges, such as predicting the structure of multiple interacting proteins in a complex.",
            "AI tools are designing entirely new proteins that could transform medicine",
            "Now, many hope that these competitions can push the protein-design field forwards just as CASP helped to spur a revolution in protein-structure prediction. \u201cThere would have not been an AlphaFold had it not been for CASP,\u201d says Rost. \u201cWe need these competitions to do the job right and motivate people.\u201d",
            "In June, Rost and several of his colleagues won the Protein Engineering Tournament run by Align to Innovate, an international, open-science non-profit organization. The event included two parts. First, participants tried to predict the properties of different enzyme variants. The best-performing teams in this round then re-engineered an enzyme that breaks down starch, with the best designs determined by lab experiments. A 2025 tournament is now in the works.",
            "A Winter Protein Design Games contest that announced its winner in April was run by Liberum Bio, a biotechnology company in Kitchener, Canada, and Rosetta Commons, a collaboration of mostly academic scientists that maintains protein modelling tools. The contest tasked entrants with re-engineering an existing protein \u2014 a plant-virus enzyme used widely in protein purification \u2014 to make the molecule more efficient.",
            "Two other contests asked participants to come up with entirely new proteins. Adaptyv\u2019s was looking for proteins capable of attaching to a growth hormone receptor called EGFR that is overactive in many cancers. The 90 entrants submitted more than 700 designs.",

            "What\u2019s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution",
            "The competitions could prove counterproductive if they send the field down a rabbit hole \u2014 for example, by judging designs too narrowly, warns Rost. Researchers could also fail to reap the full benefits of protein-design competitions if contestants keep quiet about their approaches, says Anthony Gitter, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \u201cIf teams aren\u2019t communicating their methods, there\u2019s not much opportunity to learn about what work and what fails.\u201d",
            "So far, this doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. Most of the competitions encourage or even require participants to describe their approaches. The contests could also help to bring together some of the disparate fields that have been drawn to protein design \u2014 from biochemistry labs that pioneered protein engineering methods to machine-learning scientists who cut their teeth in natural-language processing, says Gitter. \u201cPeople organizing the competitions, to have maximum impact on the field, should think really hard about how to create a community.\u201d",
            "When the Adaptyv competition results were announced in late September, Naka was disappointed. Although all ten of his entries looked strong, none of his designs worked in the lab. Only 5 of the 147 designs that were tested actually bound to the target molecule. And more than 50 of them couldn\u2019t even be made.",
            "That actually isn\u2019t bad: past efforts to design EGFR binders have had much lower success rates. \u201cIt\u2019s par for the course in protein engineering \u2014 you have to be ready to fail a lot,\u201d Naka says. The winners were Martin Pacesa and Lennart Nickel, structural biologists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, who posted a preprint describing their approach and made its code open-source (M.

Van Dyken and his team wondered what effect a high-chitin diet might have on metabolism.",

The stretching activated type 2 immunity, which in turn triggered a chitin-digesting enzyme. But preventing this enzyme from functioning had noticeable upsides: mice that were genetically modified so that they couldn\u2019t produce the enzyme gained less weight, had less body fat and had better insulin sensitivity than did normal mice when both were fed chitin1.

But when they looked for the same cells in obese mice on a high-fat diet, they found much lower levels \u2014 along with elevated psoriatic inflammation. By searching data from studies of cells taken from people with psoriasis, Li also found the same cells disrupted as in mice.",

            "Evidence is building that fasting reduces the risks of a broad sweep of conditions, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes and asthma, in some cases through the immune system. For example, fasting has been shown to reduce the number of circulating monocytes, cells that defend the body against foreign invaders but that can be a hallmark of several autoimmune conditions3.",
            "Some researchers think that they can use such evidence to treat people with these conditions without them needing to eat less. For instance, Cheng Zhan, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, wanted to investigate a group of neurons in the brainstem that helps to regulate the immune system, to see whether manipulating them could elicit the desired effect.",
            "Yo-yo dieting accelerates cardiovascular disease by reprogramming the immune system",
            "In a paper published in January, Zhan and his team demonstrated that these neurons were activated in mice in response to fasting, and that they caused T cells to retreat from the blood, spleen and lymph nodes to their central reservoir, the bone marrow4. Zhan also used a mouse model of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis to show that the continuous activation of these neurons significantly alleviated paralysis, prevented disease-related weight loss and increased survival.",

            "Although evidence supporting fasting as a therapy has grown in the past decade or so, cutting back on calories could have detrimental effects in some circumstances. For example, it could blunt immune responses. In a study published last year, Filip Swirski, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and his colleagues recorded a 90% reduction in monocytes circulating in the blood of fasting mice, and an increase in these cells in the bone marrow, where they are produced5.",
            "When the mice were fed after fasting for 24 hours, the monocytes flooded back into the blood in unusually large numbers, causing monocytosis, a condition usually associated with infectious and autoimmune disease. These post-fasting monocytes also lived longer than normal and had a lower-than-usual threshold for triggering inflammation. When the researchers infected the mice that had fasted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, the animals died sooner and in larger numbers than did non-fasted controls.",
            "Common sweetener suppresses mouse immune system \u2014 in high doses",
            "Swirski thinks that the body preserves its stock of monocytes as a protective mechanism while energy reserves are low. However, if fasting is prolonged, the costs can outweigh the benefits.",
            "Further work is needed to understand the implications of the study in humans, but Swirski says it might warn against excessive or lengthy fasting. \u201cThere is plenty of evidence that fasting can be beneficial, but sometimes it\u2019s about finding a balance and not pushing your system to extremes.\u201d Swirski himself tends to skip lunch, \u201cbut I would not want to fast excessively\u201d, he says.",
            "Fasting redistributes immune cells within hours. And other changes in diet can prompt similarly rapid, short-lived changes to immunity. Studying those changes is helpful for researchers, in part because it helps them to avoid the confounding factors that can undermine research into long-term dietary changes, says Siracusa. He has studied the impact of \u2018feast diets\u2019 \u2014 the tendency to overindulge in energy-dense, high-fat foods.",
            "Siracusa and colleagues fed mice an \u2018indulgent\u2019 low-fibre, high-fat diet for three days, then a normal diet for three days, before repeating the cycle. The switch to the high-fat diet suppressed immunity and made mice more susceptible to bacterial infection6. It reduced the number and undermined the function of certain T cells that help the body to detect and memorize pathogens; further tests showed that the lack of fibre impaired the gut microbiome, which usually supports these T cells. \u201cI was surprised that changing the diet for just three days was enough time to see these dramatic effects on adaptive immune-system cells,\u201d adds Siracusa.",
            "When Siracusa asked six human volunteers to switch from a high-fibre to low-fibre diet, he saw similar effects on their T cells. The effects \u2014 as with any holiday feast \u2014 were transient, but Siracusa thinks that looking at these early immune events relating to changes in diet could reveal insights into the causes of chronic immune conditions. However, he emphasizes that he would not make dietary recommendations on the basis of this small proof-of-principle experiment. Furthermore, work in mice can provide only clues as to what happens in humans.",

Blood samples showed that shifting to either diet was linked to clear changes in both the numbers of different immune cells and which genes were being activated in them7.",
            "While on the ketogenic diet, participants had enhanced levels and activity of T and B cells that form part of the adaptive immune system, which mounts a \u2018precision\u2019 response that recognizes specific foes. Those on the vegan diet saw enhanced innate immune responses, which are quicker and less specific than adaptive responses. Belkaid was delighted to see such clear results and is excited at their clinical potential, but refuses to offer dietary advice on the basis of them at this stage. Yet, despite differences in age, genetics and body weight, she says, \u201cit was surprising to see how convergent the immune-system effects were\u201d in just two weeks. \u201cThe next step is to test dietary interventions for specific conditions in clinical trials that are as rigorous as those we do for drugs,\u201d she says.",
            "Hall\u2019s group is considering including people with lupus in a study, to compare the effects of different diets. Others have done preliminary studies on the use of ketogenic diets as add-on therapies for psoriasis8 and type 1 diabetes9. There has also been a substantial increase in research into the use of diet and nutrition to boost the effects of therapies that co-opt the immune system to target cancer10. One study, published in 2021, found that higher dietary-fibre consumption was associated with improved survival in people receiving an immunotherapy for melanoma, and that mice with melanomas and that were fed a low-fibre diet had fewer killer T cells \u2014 which attack cancer cells \u2014 near their tumours11.",

However, she and Siracusa are among a growing group of immunologists who are optimistic that the mechanistic insights they and others are uncovering are the first steps towards personalized diets for a range of medical conditions. \u201cI can imagine a world, in the next 10 years, in which we have access to rigorous dietary advice that can be applied in a range of clinical settings,\u201d she says. \u201cI think highly informed nutrition has enormous clinical potential.\u201d",

            "When the researchers exposed H. henanensis to radiation doses of 200 and 2,000 grays \u2014 far beyond what would be survivable for humans \u2014 they found that 2,801 genes involved in DNA repair, cell division and immune responses became active.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s like when in wartime, when factories are refitted to just make munitions. It\u2019s almost that level of retooling how gene expression is working,\u201d says Bob Goldstein, a cell biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who has been studying tardigrades for 25 years. \u201cWe\u2019re fascinated by how an organism would change their gene expression to a point where they\u2019re making that much transcript for specific genes.\u201d",
            "What Chernobyl\u2019s stray dogs could teach us about radiation",
            "One of the genes, called TRID1, encodes a protein that helps to repair double-strand breaks in DNA by recruiting specialized proteins at sites of damage. \u201cThis is a new [gene] that, to my knowledge, no one was studying,\u201d says Goldstein.",
            "The researchers also estimate that 0.5\u20133.1% of the tardigrade\u2019s genes were acquired from other organisms through a process known as horizontal gene transfer. A gene called DODA1, which seems to have been acquired from bacteria, enables tardigrades to produce four types of antioxidant pigments called betalains. These pigments can mop up some of the harmful reactive chemicals that radiation causes to form inside cells, which account for 60\u201370% of radiation\u2019s damaging effects.",
            "The authors treated human cells with one of the tardigrade\u2019s betalains and found that they were much better at surviving radiation than cells that were not treated.",
            "h2No expiration date",
            "Studying the molecular mechanisms that allow tardigrades to tolerate other harsh conditions, such as extreme temperatures, air deprivation, dehydration and starvation, could have wide applications. It could improve the shelf life of fragile substances such as vaccines, for example. \u201cAll your medicines have expiration dates \u2014 tardigrades don\u2019t,\u201d says Goldstein.",
            "Comparing these mechanisms between different tardigrades is an important part of this research, adds Nadja M\u00f8bjerg, an animal physiologist at the University of Copenhagen. \u201cWe are still lacking knowledge of different tardigrade species out there,\u201d she says.",
            "These animals have \u201ca font of protectants that will probably keep spilling out more that will be useful and interesting to understand\u201d, says Goldstein. \u201cWe want to understand how those work and what potential they have.\u201d",

            "The preliminary findings confirm researchers\u2019 hypothesis that a small faecal-matter transplant is enough to have a positive effect on the infant\u2019s microbiome, says Otto Helve, director of the public-health department at the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare in Helsinki, Finland, and the study\u2019s primary investigator.",
            "h2Inherited microbes",
            "Some studies show that babies born by c-section, rather than vaginal birth, have a higher risk of asthma, inflammation of the digestive system and other diseases associated with a dysfunctional immune system1. Scientists think that these differences arise because babies born by c-section aren\u2019t exposed to and rapidly colonized by the microbes in their mothers\u2019 vaginas and guts. Studies have even shown that c-section babies are more vulnerable to pathogens in hospitals than are babies born by vaginal birth2.",
            "Do C-section babies need mum\u2019s microbes? Trials tackle controversial idea",
            "Experiments have attempted to compensate for that by swabbing babies born by c-section with microbes from their mother\u2019s vagina or giving them these microbes orally, a practice known as \u2018vaginal seeding\u2019. But this technique has had limited success, because vaginal microbes, scientists have learnt, cannot effectively colonize infants\u2019 guts, says Yan Shao, a microbiome scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK.",
            "Helve and his colleagues have been pioneers in testing whether faecal transplants can instead improve the health of a baby\u2019s microbiome. In their latest trial, which recruited women scheduled for a c-section at the Helsinki University Hospital, the researchers mixed a fluid containing 3.5 milligrams of a mother\u2019s poo into milk and gave the concoction to the corresponding baby. They did this for 15 babies during their first feed. Another 16 babies received a placebo.",
            "An analysis of the babies\u2019 poo samples showed that the two groups had similar microbial diversity at birth, but from their second day of life, there is a marked difference between the two groups, which persisted until 6 months of age, around when babies start eating solid food.",
            "C-section babies are missing key microbes",
            "The trial, which will monitor the babies during their first two years, is ongoing, but the early data align with what was seen in a small pilot study3 without a placebo group published by the same team in 2020. The researchers studied seven babies and found that the microbiomes of those that received a maternal faecal transplant developed similarly to those of babies born by vaginal delivery.",
            "Given the success of the pilot study, \u201cit isn\u2019t surprising that maternal faecal microbiota transplantation would make a difference to the c-section infant microbiota\u201d in the latest trial, Shao says. He notes that, although the trial is an important clinical study, it doesn\u2019t directly compare the microbiome of treated c-section babies with that of infants delivered vaginally \u2014 which would be needed to demonstrate that the technique effectively restores microbiomes affected by c-section.",
            "h2\u2018Don\u2019t try this at home\u2019",
            "The researchers emphasize that no one should try this approach at home. Trial participants went through extensive screening. \u201cYou have to be certain that the faecal matter that you give to the newborn doesn\u2019t include pathogens that could cause a disease,\u201d Helve says. From 90 women initially included, 54 were excluded owing to the presence of pathogens or another screening failure. \u201cEven if it sounds simple, it should be well controlled,\u201d Helve adds.",
            "Helve warns that the approach is unlikely to be a good fit for every infant born by c-section. In a large enough group of children, he says, you have enough statistical power to see that some diseases, such as asthma, are more prevalent in those born by c-section. \u201cBut on an individual level, the differences are very small.\u201d So his team is studying whether groups at high risk of developing certain diseases would benefit most.",
            "An important next step in the field, Shao says, would be to pinpoint the specific maternal gut microbes that are most likely to transmit to and colonize their babies\u2019 guts. Shao asks: \u201cIf these species do exist across human populations, wouldn\u2019t it be more effective and safer\u201d to give newborns a laboratory-made transplant that\u2019s guaranteed to be pathogen-free?",

Other evidence suggests that the first person to become infected in the outbreak probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave that hosts a species of bat known to harbour the virus.",

Scientists praise the country\u2019s efforts to control the outbreak, investigate its origins and share data with the scientific community. \u201cAs soon as they realized it was a problem, they started contact tracing, conducted a thorough epidemiological investigation, identified the [first] patient and potentially the source of the infection \u2014 and managed to roll out an experimental vaccine trial within a week,\u201d says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. This shows that, with the Marburg virus disease, \u201ca rapid urgent response can mitigate severity of the outbreak\u201d, she adds.",

Outbreaks of Marburg \u2014 which causes high fever, severe diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, and in severe cases, bleeding from the nose or gums \u2014 now occur about once a year. Before the 2020s, they were detected at most a few times each decade.",
            "Since the outbreak began, reports of new infections have dropped off notably. Rwandan health officials have recorded one new case and no deaths in the past 10 days, and only two people remain in isolation and treatment. A Marburg outbreak can be declared over when no new cases have been reported for 42 consecutive days.",

            "There is no proven vaccine or treatment for infections with the virus, which is closely related to Ebola virus, both in its symptoms and in its transmission, which is primarily through contact with bodily fluids. Health officials are offering a candidate vaccine, made by the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington DC, to the contacts of infected individuals. More than 1,200 doses have been administered so far.",
            "This outbreak has one of the lowest fatality rates \u2014 about 24% \u2014 on record for Marburg; previous outbreaks reported fatality rates as high as 90%. This is probably a result of there being quick diagnoses, access to medical care and that most infections are in relatively young health-care workers.",

This marks the first time that people with Marburg virus disease have been extubated in Africa, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, said at a briefing on 20 October. \u201cThese patients would have died in previous outbreaks,\u201d he said.",

They also found that the virus strain is closely related to one detected in Uganda in 2014 and to one found in bats in 2009, Yvan Butera, Rwanda\u2019s minister of state for health, who co-led the research, tells Nature.",

            "Comparison of the 2014 strain with the one causing the current outbreak shows a \u201climited mutation rate\u201d, Butera says, suggesting that there have probably been few changes to the virus\u2019s transmissibility or lethality over the past decade. Generally, viruses collect mutations as they replicate over time; if it is true that the mutation rate is low, Rasmussen wonders how the virus lingers in its animal reservoir \u2014 the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) \u2014 without major changes.",

But it seems to be the first at-scale, real-world demonstration of a text watermark. \u201cTo my mind, by far the most important news here is just that they\u2019re actually deploying this,\u201d says Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, who until August worked on watermarks at OpenAI, the creators of ChatGPT based in San Francisco, California.",

When given a string of text, the model assigns to each token in its vocabulary a probability of being next in the sentence. The sampling algorithm\u2019s job is to select, from this distribution, which token to use, according to a set of rules.",
            "The SynthID-Text sampling algorithm uses a cryptographic key to assign random scores to each possible token. Candidate tokens are pulled from the distribution, in numbers proportional to their probability, and placed in a \u2018tournament\u2019. There, the algorithm compares scores in a series of one-on-one knockouts, with the highest value winning, until there is only one token standing, which is selected for use in the text.",
            "Rise of ChatGPT and other tools raises major questions for research",
            "This elaborate scheme makes it easier to detect the watermark, which involves running the same cryptographic code on generated text to look for the high scores that are indicative of \u2018winning\u2019 tokens. It might also make it more difficult to remove.",
            "The multiple rounds in the tournament can be likened to a combination lock, in which each round represents a different digit that must be solved to unlock or remove the watermark, says Huang. \u201cThis mechanism makes it significantly more challenging to scrub, spoof or reverse-engineer the watermark,\u201d she adds. With text containing around 200 tokens, the authors showed that they could still detect the watermark, even when a second LLM was used to paraphrase the text. For shorter strings of text, the watermark is less robust.",

The resilience of watermarks to such attacks is a \u201cmassive policy question\u201d, says Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, a computer scientist at Imperial College London. \u201cIn the context of AI safety, it\u2019s unclear the extent to which this is providing protection,\u201d he says.",
