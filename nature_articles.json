            "Scientists in Boston, Massachusetts have made reprogrammed stem cells from the blood of centenarians. They plan to share the cells with other researchers to better understand the factors that contribute to a long and healthy life. Early experiments are already providing insights on brain ageing.",
            "Centenarians offer an opportunity to study longevity. People who\u2019ve lived to 100 have an amazing ability to bounce back from insult and injury, says George Murphy, a stem-cell biologist at the Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. One centenarian he knows recovered from the 1912 Spanish flu and COVID-19, twice. One theory that explains centenarians\u2019 robust age is that they possess a genetic makeup that protects them from diseases. ",
            "But testing that idea is a challenge. People of that age are rare, which makes blood and skin samples from them a precious resource for research. That gave Murphy and his colleagues the idea to create a bank of centenarian cells that could be shared among scientists.",
            "\u201cThis bank is really exciting,\u201d says Chiara Herzog, who studies epigenetics and ageing at Kings College London.",
            "\u201cIt will be a very useful resource for the field,\u201d says Vadim Gladyshev, an ageing researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston.",
            "h2Finding centenarians",
            "Murphy collaborated with Tom Perls, a physician specializing in geriatrics, also at the Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, who runs the largest study of people 100 years and older, the New England Centenarian Study. They searched for centenarians in US voter-registration lists, news articles and long-term-care facilities. Many were happy to participate \u201cbecause they know how special they are\u201d, says Perls.",
            "Participants were assessed for their cognitive and physical abilities, and had samples of their blood collected. Many were cognitively healthy and cared for themselves.",
            "For about 30 centenarians, the researchers isolated blood cells and reverted them to a pluripotent state, from which they could be turned into any cell type in the body. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells lose many aspects of their \u2018age\u2019 through the reversion process without altering their genetic code. This allows researchers to use the cells to study the genetic determinants of ageing, says Herzog.",
            "h2Emerging insights",
            "Experiments using the cells are already underway. For instance, Murphy\u2019s group has grown neurons from the centenarian iPS cells. One hallmark of ageing is that cells lose some of the quality-control mechanisms involved in protein production, which can contribute to disease. The as-yet unpublished results suggest that neurons derived from centenarians were quieter, not engaging this quality control under normal conditions compared with neurons derived from non-centenarians. But when a stressor was introduced, the centenarian-derived neurons efficiently and robustly switched those processes on, swiftly separating the bad proteins from the good ones at a more intense rate. ",
            "Another group has created 3D brain models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease using centenarian-derived brain cells and compared them with models made from cells derived from individuals in their 60s. In preliminary studies, the researchers found that centenarian-derived brain cells express high levels of genes associated with protection from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, says Doo Yeon Kim, a neurology researcher at Harvard Medical School.",
            "Eventually, researchers hope to use the cells to develop other cell types relevant to ageing, such as liver, muscle and gut cells, or even mini organs.",

            "Using 3D X-ray-based imaging techniques, the researchers studied how the motion of a foot shapes the tracks it leaves. They compared arch depth and toe angles in the hominin footprints with those of humans.

The study, which was published in Nature on 27 November, analysed hundreds of pieces of fossilized digestive material, called bromalites, to reconstruct what dinosaurs ate and how this changed1. The fossils reveal that the rise of the dinosaurs, over millions of years during the Triassic period, was influenced by factors including climate change and other species\u2019 extinction.",

            "Palaeontologists have come up with differing theories for how dinosaurs became the dominant species on Earth. Dinosaurs might have overtaken their rivals because they were particularly able to adapt to a changing ecosystem, for instance, or because random environmental changes favoured them over other species. But there isn\u2019t a single hypothesis that fully explains their rise to dominance.",

            "The team used several methods to analyse the bromalites and their contents, including different types of microscope and a technique known as synchrotron microtomography, which uses a particle accelerator to see inside the fossils in detail. The researchers also used chemical solutions to inspect the exact contents of the remains, which included fish, plants and insects.",
            "Despite the age and acidity of many of the fossils, the team found many of the insects the dinosaurs ate to be well preserved. \u201cSome of them were so beautifully preserved in three dimensions and with all the antennae and legs,\u201d says Qvarnstr\u00f6m.",
            "Analysis of the digestive materials allowed the researchers to \u201creconstruct these food webs, so who was eating whom in all these assemblages and see this trend over such a long period of time\u201d, Qvarnstr\u00f6m says.",
            "h2Adapt or die",
            "The team found that the number and variety of the contents of the fossils increased over time, suggesting that larger dinosaurs with more diverse feeding habits began to gain prominence in the late Triassic period (between 237 million and 201 million years ago). By comparing the fossils with plant data from the period, the researchers found that dinosaurs\u2019 rise was shaped by chance and by adaptations. For example, climate change led to increased humidity, which changed the vegetation available. Dinosaurs were able to better adapt to this shifting climate and change in diet than were other land animals.",

            "Negotiators from 175 countries are in Busan, South Korea, to thrash out what many hope will be a legally binding United Nations treaty to drastically cut plastic pollution. Researchers are hopeful a strong treaty will emerge from the fifth \u2014 and final \u2014 session of the negotiations, but there is a high chance that any agreement will be weak or delayed. Until a global consensus is reached, however, many cities and nations are introducing their own policies.",
            "\u201cSome countries are pre-emptively protecting themselves, regardless of what happens with the treaty,\u201d says Trisia Farrelly, an environmental anthropologist at New Zealand\u2019s Cawthron Institute in Nelson and a co-lead of the Scientists\u2019 Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, an independent group attending the meeting as an observer. ",
            "These policies showcase what can work, researchers say, but also highlight why a global effort is important. Some groups, including the scientists\u2019 coalition, support a treaty that will reduce production of non-essential plastics, which have skyrocketed to unsustainable levels. But some nations, particularly those that make petrochemicals, want the treaty to focus on waste management instead, including steps such as recycling.",
            " \u201cIf we miss this opportunity to do unified policy-making with standardized guidelines, we\u2019re going to set ourselves back decades or more,\u201d says Douglas McCauley at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who published modelling work on plastics policies earlier this month1.",
            "h2Ban single-use plastics",
            "More than 90 nations and territories have passed full or partial bans on single-use plastic products such as carrier bags. These bans can be very effective. One analysis showed that bans in five US states and cities together cut consumption of single-use plastic bags by about six billion bags per year2. Several studies have also shown huge reductions in plastic litter in waterways, says McCauley. Even fees can work. A litter survey in the United Kingdom found that the number of plastic bags found on beaches dropped by 80% after the nation introduced a mandatory fee for single-use carrier bags, although other forms of litter had increased.",
            "But bans that are poorly designed or enforced are likely to be ineffective. California, for example, allowed shops to switch to thicker, reusable carrier bags \u2014 but people still threw them away, leading to a higher rate of plastic disposal than before. Policies need to be monitored and reviewed, says McCauley. \u201cYou have to put a policy in place, take data and then whack-a-mole the loopholes.\u201d",
            "h2Make the producer pay",
            "Many nations and US states require companies that produce plastic packaging to pay for it to be recycled, which can boost recycling rates. In Spain,for example, the government introduced an \u2018extended producer responsibilities\u2019 policy, and the recycling of paper and plastics rose from 5% up to 81%.",
            "Such policies are also meant to incentivize companies to redesign their packaging, but because most of the fees are based on weight, they mainly influence the amount of packaging used rather than its composition. A good idea, says Richard Thompson, a marine scientist at the University of Plymouth, UK, and a co-lead of the scientists\u2019 coalition, is to have a policy that rewards or mandates inclusion of recycled content in products: in the United Kingdom, for example, plastic producers pay a tax of \u00a3217.85 (US$274) per tonne of plastic, but only for packaging that\u2019s less than 30% recycled. Such incentives \u201cwill pull demand in the right way\u201d, says Thompson.",
            "As with all policies, there are some good, some bad, says Farrelly. She has seen policies that end up increasing the use of recycling centres in the Pacific islands that don\u2019t have high safety standards for their workers, for example.",

Rather than building up gradually, as others have done, by debuting systems of tens or hundreds of quantum bits, PsiQuantum is aiming to jump to a machine that will require something in the order of one million qubits. (PsiQuantum\u2019s researchers haven\u2019t published a specific number.) To do that, it will need to overcome technical challenges it has not proved it can solve, says Chao-Yang Lu, a physicist working on photonic quantum computing at the University of Science and Technology of China in Shanghai. He is one of several scientists who worry the firm is promising things it will struggle to deliver.",
            "\u201cMy impression is there\u2019s a lot of scepticism about how much progress PsiQuantum has made,\u201d says Shimon Kolkowitz, a quantum physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. He calls a bet on them \u201cextremely high risk\u201d.",
            "PsiQuantum researchers say the firm has achieved more than it has publicly shown, and that funders have scrutinized its plans. O\u2019Brien himself talks about challenges in the past tense and insists that there is little doubt of success. And some independent researchers see its plans as being at least plausible. \u201cI think it\u2019s an amazing gamble,\u201d says Pascale Senellart, a quantum optical physicist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Palaiseau. \u201cIt\u2019s really worth exploring.\u201d",
            "h2Flying qubits",
            "PsiQuantum\u2019s approach is radically different to that of some major rivals (see \u2018Comparing quantum computers\u2019 at the end of this article), because of its choice of qubit \u2014 the basic unit of quantum information. Whereas the binary digits (bits) of classical computers encode either a 1 or a 0, qubits can be put into a \u2018superposition\u2019 \u2014 existing in two states at once, a combination of both 1 and 0, with a chance of being measured as either. Calculations come from \u2018entangling\u2019 these qubits, meaning that their quantum states become intrinsically linked and interdependent. To prevent errors from destroying the calculations, a quantum computer will need around 10,000 physical qubits working together to make each useful \u2018logical\u2019 qubit, O\u2019Brien says. With a few hundred of these, researchers hope that quantum computers will be able to perform complex calculations, such as modelling chemical processes at the quantum level, that would be much too difficult for a classical machine.",
            "Many firms in the field make their qubits from atoms, ions or tiny rings of a superconducting material \u2014 in each case, a physical object that has some mass and is often fixed in place. But PsiQuantum is one of a handful of companies that uses massless particles of light, or photons \u2014 sometimes known as flying qubits.",
            "The idea to use light as a qubit isn\u2019t new. In the early 2000s, optical quantum computing was one of the first platforms to be explored experimentally. Some of PsiQuantum\u2019s founders were involved in the field\u2019s birth, says Senellart, who is a co-founder of Quandela, a firm based near Paris that makes photonic quantum computers.",
            "Making a quantum computer with light is \u201con paper, quite easy\u201d, she says. PsiQuantum creates qubits by using an optical device called a beam splitter to send a single photon simultaneously down two routes (known as waveguides) etched into silicon. Because photons have no charge or mass, they are largely unaffected by their surroundings. This means that, even at room temperature, photon-based qubits are insensitive to many types of noise that plague rival hardware. This ability to maintain quantum information and travel long distances at speed makes it easy to build big and fast systems. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge asset,\u201d says Senellart.",
            "IBM releases first-ever 1,000-qubit quantum chip",
            "But photons also come with hurdles. It is hard to generate single, near-identical photons on demand. They are readily absorbed and lost. And getting the flighty particles to interact is a challenge. Although light waves do interfere with each other, that kind of interaction alone is not sufficient for constructing multi-qubit gates, in which qubits entangle to form basic logic operations.",
            "To generate photons, the firm pumps laser light through silicon. These sources are probabilistic: they produce pairs of photons perhaps once in every 20 attempts. Having a pair is necessary because the spare, or \u2018herald\u2019, photon provides a heads-up that allows the computer to use the surviving photon.",
            "With this strategy, each chip needs many such sources, as well as super-efficient waveguides and optical components that can handle photons without losing them.",
            "To perform logic operations, PsiQuantum first builds up clusters of entangled photon qubits by bringing photons together so that their light waves interfere, then making measurements on some of them in ways that entangle the remaining qubits. Calculations then occur by performing a succession of such measurements on pairs of photons from different clusters. Those measurements destroy the pairs but entangle their clusters, a technique known as fusion-based quantum computing (see \u2018Quantum computers with \u2018flying qubits\u2019\u2019). Senellart says that PsiQuantum has an impressive team working on developing the theory behind such a computer. \u201cThey are coming up with a lot of smart schemes,\u201d she says.",

            "PsiQuantum\u2019s approach continually generates and destroys photons, with each qubit needing to exist only for long enough to be entangled or measured with another, not for the duration of the calculation. And although each operation involves an element of chance and photons will get lost, failures are detectable as part of the measurement, says Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia, a physicist at PsiQuantum who is working on the computer\u2019s architecture.",

            "PsiQuantum is not the only company pursuing quantum computing using light. Most firms plan to eventually scale up their systems by entangling devices using photonic qubits, so mastering them now makes sense, says Senellart. None is close to PsiQuantum\u2019s billion-dollar backing. The company Xanadu, in Toronto, Canada, uses as its qubits \u2018squeezed\u2019 states, which encode information into the electromagnetic field of multiple photons. It has created a machine of more than 200 qubits and has raised a few hundred million dollars in funding. Quandela, which has raised $67.5 million, sells small machines that use on-demand sources of single photons, to boost efficiency and reduce a computer\u2019s size. And ORCA Computing, based in London, is developing a way to store single photons as a short-term quantum memory; it has raised at least $15 million.",

The firm\u2019s chips \u2014 made in partnership with US semiconductor giant Global Foundries \u2014 combine conventional technology such as beam splitters with components such as single-photon detectors and sources, which are rarely used outside laboratories. These are all etched onto silicon wafers, where they manipulate telecoms-frequency photons.",

            "For its system to work, the company needs millions of precision electronic components that must operate at unprecedented efficiency and can\u2019t simply be taken off the shelf. Detectors, for example, need to be chilled to around 4 kelvin using liquid helium. The biggest challenge, says O\u2019Brien, has been creating optical switches to divert photons into calculations. For this, the company built its own facility to grow high-purity wafers of barium titanate, a material that can steer light efficiently. The firm spent a vast amount of money and made a big bet, says O\u2019Brien: this leap of faith is one of the things he is proudest of.",

The firm, which once had a reputation for being secretive, is starting to open up. In April, it published a preprint outlining its hardware platform, which White calls jaw-dropping (K. Alexander et al. Preprint at arXiv https://doi.org/gtzxqj; 2024). It shows efficiencies, such as in getting light off a chip into a fibre, that are \u201cwell ahead of what the best university labs could do\u201d, he says.",

For example, he says, the likelihood that a heralded particle is detected is reported as 26%, when it needs to be more than 50%. \u201cIt is not encouraging that, after many years, they are still struggling with good single photon sources, since it is the most basic building block of their proposed architecture,\u201d he says. Any photonic quantum computer will need to reduce photon losses to levels never previously demonstrated at scale, says Stephanie Simmons, a quantum physicist at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada.",
            "In response, Thompson says the team\u2019s papers are \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d of what PsiQuantum has achieved. Commercial secrecy might be one reason that the team is not publishing its best work. \u201cTo publish in academic journals is very time-consuming and quite a distraction,\u201d he says.",

If the firm can manage without, \u201cit\u2019s just amazing\u201d.",

With no NISQ computer, the firm has been less active than some at recruiting end users or software partners, says Finke, adding to its air of mystery. White says: \u201cPublicly, they haven\u2019t demonstrated in their papers anything other than entanglement between a couple of photons.\u201d",
