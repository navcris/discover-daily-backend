Move over morning coffee: mushroom tea could bolster your anticancer defences. Claims such as these, linking health, diet and immunity, bombard supermarket shoppers and pervade the news.",
            "Beyond the headlines and product labels, the scientific foundations of many such claims are often based on limited evidence. That\u2019s partly because conducting rigorous studies to track what people eat and the impact of diet is a huge challenge. In addition, the relevance to human health of results from studies of animals and cells isn\u2019t clear and has sometimes been exaggerated for commercial gain, feeding scepticism in nutrition science.",
            "In the past five or so years, however, researchers have developed innovative approaches to nutrition immunology that are helping to close this credibility gap. Whereas nutrition scientists have conventionally studied the long-term impacts of loosely defined Mediterranean or Western diets, for example, today they have access to tools that allow them to zoom in on the short-term effects \u2014 both helpful and harmful \u2014 of narrower food groups and specific dietary components, and to probe the molecular mechanisms underpinning the effects of foods on immunity.",
            "\n\nMediterranean diet linked to immunotherapy response\n",
            "The field is starting to attract attention and funding. In April, the New England Journal of Medicine launched a series of review articles on nutrition, immunity and disease, and in January, the US Department of Health and Human Services held its first-ever Food is Medicine summit in Washington DC, which explored links between food insecurity, diet and chronic diseases.",
            "Some researchers argue that modern diets, especially those of the Western world, have skewed our immune responses in ways that have undermined immune resilience. More optimistically, others say that diet could also help to treat a range of health problems, such as cancers and chronic immune disorders such as lupus.",
            "It\u2019s early days, but many scientists in the field are hopeful. \u201cWe are learning a lot more about how you can modulate your immune system with single components or combinations of food components,\u201d says immunologist Francesco Siracusa at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany. As a potential therapy, he says, \u201cthe blooming of the personalized nutrition field over the last five to six years is very exciting\u201d.",
            "h2Fibre and fat",
            "Physicians since Hippocrates have been exploring links between diet and health. In 1912, Polish biochemist Casimir Funk proposed that a lack of essential nutrients he called \u2018vitamines\u2019 was causing diseases including scurvy and rickets; later studies of vitamins confirmed their roles in immunity.",
            "In the past decade, the greater availability of \u2018omics\u2019 techniques, which can catalogue and analyse entire sets of biomolecules such as genes and proteins in cells or tissues, has helped researchers to unpick the mechanisms by which different diets and dietary components affect the immune system, and therefore health.",
            "Many laboratories are interested in harnessing the immune system to treat one of today\u2019s most pressing health concerns: obesity. Steven Van Dyken, an immunologist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, has been studying an immune response usually triggered in response to allergens and parasites, to see whether it could help to regulate metabolism.",
            "He and others had previously observed how a type of dietary fibre called chitin, which is abundant in mushrooms, crustaceans and edible insects, activates this immune response, known as type 2 immunity. Van Dyken and his team wondered what effect a high-chitin diet might have on metabolism.",
            "So they fed mice such a diet, and observed that their stomachs stretched much more than did those of mice on a normal diet. The stretching activated type 2 immunity, which in turn triggered a chitin-digesting enzyme. But preventing this enzyme from functioning had noticeable upsides: mice that were genetically modified so that they couldn\u2019t produce the enzyme gained less weight, had less body fat and had better insulin sensitivity than did normal mice when both were fed chitin1. Chitin also triggered increases in levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), the hormone that Ozempic (semaglutide) and other similar weight-loss drugs mimic, which helps to suppress appetite.",

            "Tuning the relationship between chitin, immunity and health \u2014 by reducing levels of the chitin-digesting enzyme, for example \u2014 could inform the development of therapies such as appetite-suppressing drugs. \u201cPrevious research has shown that chitin may activate similar human immune responses,\u201d says Van Dyken. Tweaking these immune responses using chitin and the enzyme might \u201crepresent a therapeutic target for metabolic diseases such as obesity\u201d, he says. Van Dyken is an inventor on patent applications related to using chitin and the enzyme in therapies for respiratory and metabolic diseases.",
            "The links between obesity, immunity and health don\u2019t end there. Psoriasis, an autoimmune condition in which skin cells accumulate in dry, scaly patches, is two to three times more common in people with obesity than in those without. And weight loss has been shown to improve psoriatic symptoms.",
            "Immunologist Chaoran Li at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, wanted to know how obesity disrupts the skin\u2019s immune system. Previous research had shown how high-fat diets drive psoriasis through increased activation of immune cells that cause inflammation. Using RNA sequencing, Li and his team inventoried skin immune cells in lean mice, and found a population of T cells that usually keep psoriasis-causing inflammation in check2. But when they looked for the same cells in obese mice on a high-fat diet, they found much lower levels \u2014 along with elevated psoriatic inflammation. By searching data from studies of cells taken from people with psoriasis, Li also found the same cells disrupted as in mice.",
            "Although Li is focused on the basic mechanisms involved, he hopes that his work will help to improve treatments for the condition.",
            "h2Feast and famine",
            "If overeating and obesity harm health in multiple ways, could forgoing food have the opposite effect? And might the immune system play a key part here, too?",
            "Evidence is building that fasting reduces the risks of a broad sweep of conditions, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes and asthma, in some cases through the immune system. For example, fasting has been shown to reduce the number of circulating monocytes, cells that defend the body against foreign invaders but that can be a hallmark of several autoimmune conditions3.",
            "Some researchers think that they can use such evidence to treat people with these conditions without them needing to eat less. For instance, Cheng Zhan, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, wanted to investigate a group of neurons in the brainstem that helps to regulate the immune system, to see whether manipulating them could elicit the desired effect.",
            "\n\nYo-yo dieting accelerates cardiovascular disease by reprogramming the immune system\n",
            "In a paper published in January, Zhan and his team demonstrated that these neurons were activated in mice in response to fasting, and that they caused T cells to retreat from the blood, spleen and lymph nodes to their central reservoir, the bone marrow4. Zhan also used a mouse model of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis to show that the continuous activation of these neurons significantly alleviated paralysis, prevented disease-related weight loss and increased survival.",
            "Zhan says that findings such as these could enable people to reap the benefits of fasting \u2014 without actually going hungry. \u201cThese neurons can be activated with electrical stimulation, small molecules or other activities,\u201d he says.",
            "Although evidence supporting fasting as a therapy has grown in the past decade or so, cutting back on calories could have detrimental effects in some circumstances. For example, it could blunt immune responses. In a study published last year, Filip Swirski, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and his colleagues recorded a 90% reduction in monocytes circulating in the blood of fasting mice, and an increase in these cells in the bone marrow, where they are produced5.",
            "When the mice were fed after fasting for 24 hours, the monocytes flooded back into the blood in unusually large numbers, causing monocytosis, a condition usually associated with infectious and autoimmune disease. These post-fasting monocytes also lived longer than normal and had a lower-than-usual threshold for triggering inflammation. When the researchers infected the mice that had fasted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, the animals died sooner and in larger numbers than did non-fasted controls.",
            "\n\nCommon sweetener suppresses mouse immune system \u2014 in high doses\n",
            "Swirski thinks that the body preserves its stock of monocytes as a protective mechanism while energy reserves are low. However, if fasting is prolonged, the costs can outweigh the benefits.",
            "Further work is needed to understand the implications of the study in humans, but Swirski says it might warn against excessive or lengthy fasting. \u201cThere is plenty of evidence that fasting can be beneficial, but sometimes it\u2019s about finding a balance and not pushing your system to extremes.\u201d Swirski himself tends to skip lunch, \u201cbut I would not want to fast excessively\u201d, he says.",
            "Fasting redistributes immune cells within hours. And other changes in diet can prompt similarly rapid, short-lived changes to immunity. Studying those changes is helpful for researchers, in part because it helps them to avoid the confounding factors that can undermine research into long-term dietary changes, says Siracusa. He has studied the impact of \u2018feast diets\u2019 \u2014 the tendency to overindulge in energy-dense, high-fat foods.",
            "Siracusa and colleagues fed mice an \u2018indulgent\u2019 low-fibre, high-fat diet for three days, then a normal diet for three days, before repeating the cycle. The switch to the high-fat diet suppressed immunity and made mice more susceptible to bacterial infection6. It reduced the number and undermined the function of certain T cells that help the body to detect and memorize pathogens; further tests showed that the lack of fibre impaired the gut microbiome, which usually supports these T cells. \u201cI was surprised that changing the diet for just three days was enough time to see these dramatic effects on adaptive immune-system cells,\u201d adds Siracusa.",
            "When Siracusa asked six human volunteers to switch from a high-fibre to low-fibre diet, he saw similar effects on their T cells. The effects \u2014 as with any holiday feast \u2014 were transient, but Siracusa thinks that looking at these early immune events relating to changes in diet could reveal insights into the causes of chronic immune conditions. However, he emphasizes that he would not make dietary recommendations on the basis of this small proof-of-principle experiment. Furthermore, work in mice can provide only clues as to what happens in humans.",
            "h2Human trials",
            "Confirming those clues in people can be difficult. Precisely controlling what study participants eat over long periods is challenging, as is getting them to accurately recall and record their diets each day. \u201cOne approach is to ask people to just eat the food you provide for them,\u201d says integrative physiologist Kevin Hall at the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cHowever, we know that when you do so, they consume 400 calories of off-study food on average.\u201d",
            "So Hall and his colleagues have taken things a step further. Over the past decade, they have done a number of trials in which volunteers agreed to be confined to a ward at a US National Institutes of Health research hospital, in which their diets could be strictly controlled and their responses measured.",
            "Although Hall\u2019s main interests revolve around the effects of different diets on metabolism and body composition \u2014 his group has studied the effects of ultraprocessed foods on weight gain, for example \u2014 for a 2024 study, he worked with immunologist Yasmine Belkaid, then at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in Bethesda, to investigate immune-system changes prompted by different diets.",

            "Hall and Belkaid, who is now president of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, enlisted 20 adults for a four-week hospital stay and randomized them to follow either a ketogenic diet (one based on animal products and with low levels of carbohydrate) or a vegan, low-fat diet for the first two weeks, then the alternate diet for the final two weeks. Blood samples showed that shifting to either diet was linked to clear changes in both the numbers of different immune cells and which genes were being activated in them7.",
            "While on the ketogenic diet, participants had enhanced levels and activity of T and B cells that form part of the adaptive immune system, which mounts a \u2018precision\u2019 response that recognizes specific foes. Those on the vegan diet saw enhanced innate immune responses, which are quicker and less specific than adaptive responses. Belkaid was delighted to see such clear results and is excited at their clinical potential, but refuses to offer dietary advice on the basis of them at this stage. Yet, despite differences in age, genetics and body weight, she says, \u201cit was surprising to see how convergent the immune-system effects were\u201d in just two weeks. \u201cThe next step is to test dietary interventions for specific conditions in clinical trials that are as rigorous as those we do for drugs,\u201d she says.",
            "Hall\u2019s group is considering including people with lupus in a study, to compare the effects of different diets. Others have done preliminary studies on the use of ketogenic diets as add-on therapies for psoriasis8 and type 1 diabetes9. There has also been a substantial increase in research into the use of diet and nutrition to boost the effects of therapies that co-opt the immune system to target cancer10. One study, published in 2021, found that higher dietary-fibre consumption was associated with improved survival in people receiving an immunotherapy for melanoma, and that mice with melanomas and that were fed a low-fibre diet had fewer killer T cells \u2014 which attack cancer cells \u2014 near their tumours11.",
            "Belkaid acknowledges there is still much more work to do to unpick the effects of specific diets on the immune systems of those with different health conditions. However, she and Siracusa are among a growing group of immunologists who are optimistic that the mechanistic insights they and others are uncovering are the first steps towards personalized diets for a range of medical conditions. \u201cI can imagine a world, in the next 10 years, in which we have access to rigorous dietary advice that can be applied in a range of clinical settings,\u201d she says. \u201cI think highly informed nutrition has enormous clinical potential.\u201d",

            "Scientists have designed a new form of insulin that can automatically switch itself on and off depending on glucose levels in the blood. In animals, this \u2018smart\u2019 insulin1 reduced high blood-sugar concentrations effectively while preventing levels from dropping too low.",
            "For people with diabetes, controlling blood-sugar levels is a crucial \u2014 but demanding \u2014 task. Insulin keeps blood glucose in check, helping to prevent the many long-term complications associated with high blood sugar, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, stroke and blindness. A large proportion of the estimated 422 million people with diabetes worldwide require insulin injections.",
            "But excess insulin can cause blood-sugar levels to dip too low, a condition called hypoglycaemia, putting people at risk of serious complications, such as loss of consciousness, seizures and even death. Even mild or moderate hypoglycaemia can cause anxiety, weakness and confusion. People with diabetes \u2014 particularly those with type 1 diabetes, who always need to inject insulin \u2014 can have drops in blood-glucose concentrations several times a week, says Michael Weiss, a biochemist and physician at Indiana University in Indianapolis. \u201cIt really impairs quality of life.\u201d",
            "For decades, researchers have been working to develop a system that can automatically adjust insulin activity based on the amount of glucose in a person\u2019s blood. One common approach has been to make a compound containing deposits that release insulin when glucose concentrations rise. But a key disadvantage of this method is its irreversibility \u2014 once insulin is released, it can\u2019t be reined in.",
            "h2A sugar-sensitive switch",
            "The latest study, published today in Nature, gets around this issue by modifying insulin itself using glucose-sensitive components. Rita Slaaby, a principal scientist at pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, and her colleagues engineered an insulin molecule with a switch that turns its activity on and off in response to glucose levels in the blood. This switch consists of two parts: a ring-shaped structure known as a macrocycle and a glucoside, a molecule derived from glucose. When blood-glucose concentrations are low, the glucoside binds to the ring, keeping the insulin in a closed, inactive state. But when glucose levels in the blood rise, the sugar displaces the glucoside and changes the shape of the insulin so that it is turned on.",
            "The researchers tested the insulin molecule, which they named NNC2215, in pigs and rats that had received infusions of glucose to mimic the effects of diabetes. They found that NNC2215 was as good as normal human insulin at lowering blood glucose when injected into the animals \u2014 and that it was able to prevent the drop in blood-glucose levels that occurred with a current insulin treatment. \u201cThis a very good study that was well designed \u2014 they did all the necessary experiments to validate that this works,\u201d says David Sacks, a clinical chemist at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cIt certainly provides encouragement that this approach is worth pursuing.\u201d",
            "The modified insulin is the first shown to target glucose, says Sacks. Weiss and his colleagues have previously demonstrated that an insulin molecule with a similar kind of molecular switch was sensitive to another sugar molecule, fructose2.",
            "A few questions remain about the latest molecule. For one, the study looked at the activity of NNC2215 in a wider range of blood-glucose levels than is typically seen in people with diabetes, so future studies should demonstrate that the insulin can also be effective in a narrow range, Sacks says. Other considerations include the safety and price tag of this molecule, notes Zhen Gu, a biomedical engineer at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. (Gu\u2019s team is also designing a glucose-sensitive insulin molecule3.)",
            "A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk says that although this study is a proof of principle of NNC2215\u2019s glucose-sensitive insulin properties, further research to optimize the molecule is ongoing.",
            "Several other smart insulin drugs are in the works, says Weiss, including one his own team is designing using a similar approach. Ultimately, the goal is to generate a suite of smart insulin drugs to enable doctors to individualize therapies for their patients, he adds.",

            "It was previously thought that single-cell data sets wouldn\u2019t be as vulnerable to privacy leaks, owing to the level of \u2018noise\u2019, or variation in gene expression, between different cells. But G\u00fcrsoy and her colleagues demonstrated that was not the case.",

The researchers found that they could use data on gene expressionto predict the structure of a person\u2019s genome, by combining these values with information on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).

            "Unlike the data on gene expression and eQTLs, full-genome databases can usually be accessed only by scientists, to protect donor\u2019s identifying information. But the researchers point out that a participant\u2019s genome data can be publically available elsewhere. For example, they might have uploaded it to a genealogy website in which users send DNA samples to learn more about their ancestry. In this case, an attacker could identify an individual whose cells are in a single-cell data set using their genome. This could reveal personal data related to a sensitive trait such as a psychiatric disorder, given that research participants are often selected to study the biology of these complex conditions.",

The simplest solution would be to stop making genetic data so easily accessible, but this would negatively affect research, he says. \u201cWe need to share and aggregate large amounts of information.\u201d he says. \u201cLocking it down and making it more private, really, just gums that whole process up.\u201d",
            "In their study, G\u00fcrsoy and her colleagues say that there should be greater transparency about the risks for participants who share their genomic data, and suggest that researchers should ensure that donors give consent for their data being shared. Another way forward could be encrypting personal data when it is part of a public database. The authors acknowledge that doing this would complicate the process of building and maintaining data sets, but say that it could help to protect participants\u2019 privacy.",

            "To learn more about how such diets work, the researchers monitored the health and longevity of 960 mice, each a genetically distinct individual drawn from a diverse population that mirrors the genetic variability found in humans. Some mice were placed on calorie-limited diets, another group followed intermittent fasting regimens, and others were allowed to eat freely.",

            "Cutting calories by 40% yielded the longest longevity bump, but intermittent fasting and less severe calorie restriction also increased average lifespan. The dieting mice also displayed favourable metabolic changes, such as reductions in body fat and blood sugar levels.",
            "However, the effects of dietary restriction on metabolism and lifespan didn\u2019t always change in lockstep. To the authors\u2019 surprise, the mice that lost the most weight on a calorie-limited diet tended to die younger than did animals that lost relatively modest amounts.",
            "This suggests that processes beyond simple metabolic regulation drive how the body responds to limited-calorie regimes. What mattered most for lengthening lifespan were traits related to immune health and red-blood-cell function. Also key was overall resilience, presumably encoded in the animals\u2019 genes, to the stress of reduced food intake.",

            "On 22 September, the magnet, at the Steady High Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) at the Chinese Academy of Science\u2019s Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, sustained a steady magnetic field of 42.02 tesla. This milestone narrowly surpasses the 41.4-tesla record set in 2017 by a resistive magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida. Resistive magnets are made of coiled metal wires and are widely used in magnet facilities across the world.",
            "China\u2019s record-breaker lays the groundwork for building reliable magnets that can sustain ever-stronger magnetic fields, which would help researchers to discover surprising new physics, says Joachim Wosnitza, a physicist at the Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Germany.",
            "The resistive magnet \u2014 which is open to international users \u2014 is the country\u2019s second major contribution to the global quest to produce ever-higher magnetic fields. In 2022, the SHMFF\u2019s hybrid magnet, which combines a resistive magnet with a superconducting one, produced a field of 45.22 tesla, making it the most powerful working steady-state magnet in the world.",
            "h2Research tool",
            "High-field magnets are handy tools for uncovering hidden properties of advanced materials, such as superconductors \u2014 materials that, under very low temperatures, carry electric current without producing waste heat. High fields also offer the chance to glimpse entirely new physical phenomena, says Marc-Henri Julien, a condensed-matter physicist at the National Laboratory for Intense Magnetic Fields in Grenoble, France. \u201cYou can create or manipulate new states of matter,\u201d says Julien.",
            "High fields are also useful for experiments that rely on very sensitive measurements, because they boost the resolution and make it easier to see faint phenomena, says Alexander Eaton, a condensed-matter physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK. \u201cEvery extra tesla is exponentially better than the last,\u201d he says.",
            "Guangli Kuang, a physicist who specializes in high magnetic fields at the SHMFF, says the team spent years modifying the magnet to hit the latest record. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to achieve,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Reliable but costly",
            "Resistive magnets are an older technology, but they can sustain high magnetic fields for longer periods than can their newer hybrid and fully superconducting counterparts, says Wosnitza. Their magnetic fields can also be ramped up much quicker, making them versatile experimental tools. \u201cYou can just twist a knob and go from zero tesla to high fields within minutes,\u201d he says.",
            "The big drawback of resistive magnets is the amount of power they consume, making them costly, says Eaton. For instance, the SHMFF\u2019s resistive magnet drew 32.3 megawatts of electricity to produce its record-breaking field. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a very good science case to justify that resource,\u201d says Eaton.",
            "That challenge is driving the race to develop hybrid and fully superconducting magnets that can generate high fields with less power. In 2019, NHMFL researchers built a miniature, proof-of-concept superconducting magnet that briefly sustained a 45.5-tesla field, and are currently developing a larger 40-tesla superconducting magnet that can be used for experiments. The team at the SHMFF is building a 55-tesla hybrid one. Although these newer magnets are expected to be cheaper to run than their resistive counterparts, they come with their own hurdles: they are more expensive to build and require complicated cooling systems, says engineer Mark Bird, a co-leader of NHMFL\u2019s magnet science and technology division. \u201cThe technology is still being developed, and the costs are not clear yet,\u201d says Bird.",

            "The AlphaFold program, which predicts protein structures, identified a trio of proteins that team up to work as matchmakers between the gametes. Without them, sexual reproduction might hit a dead end in a wide range of animals, from zebrafish to mammals.",
            "The finding, published 17 October in Cell, unravels the previous notion that just two proteins \u2014 one on the egg and one on the sperm \u2014 would be sufficient to ensure fertilisation, says Enrica Bianchi, a reproductive biologist at the University of Rome \u2018Tor Vergata\u2019, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s not the old concept of having a key and a lock to open the door anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated.\u201d",
            "h2A mysterious union",
            "Despite its critical role in reproduction, the fusion of egg and sperm in vertebrates is a molecular mystery that has proved difficult to crack. The union of the two cells involves proteins that reside in greasy membranes and that are hard to study using standard biochemical methods. The interactions between these proteins are often weak and fleeting, and it is difficult to harvest enough eggs and sperm from some of researchers\u2019 favourite laboratory animals, including mice, for extensive experiments.",
            "\n\nStopping sperm at the source\n",
            "As a result, early studies of reproductive biology often focused on marine invertebrates that release copious quantities of egg and sperm into water. \u201cIf you take a textbook off the shelf and look up fertilisation, you\u2019ll read all about sea urchins,\u201d says Gavin Wright, a biochemist at the University of York, UK, who was not involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to research.\u201d",
            "To overcome the supply problem, Andrea Pauli, a molecular biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna and her colleagues, began their work in zebrafish, a vertebrate that also releases its eggs and sperm into the surrounding water. And to bypass the difficulties of working with membrane proteins in the laboratory, the team used AlphaFold to predict interactions between protein s. Two of AlphaFold\u2019s developers were awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry on 9 October.",
            "h2Not two but three",
            "AlphaFold predicted that three sperm proteins work together to form a complex. Two of these proteins were previously known to be important for fertility. Pauli and her colleagues then confirmed that the third is also critical for fertility in both zebrafish and mice, and that the three proteins interact with one another.",
            "The team also found that, in zebrafish, the trio creates a place for an egg protein to bind, providing a mechanism by which the two cells could recognize one another. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to say, \u2018Sperm, you found an egg\u2019 and \u2018Egg, you found a sperm\u2019,\u201d says Andreas Blaha, a biochemist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology and co-author of the paper.",
            "The findings might one day yield a way to screen people struggling with infertility, to find out whether problems with this complex could be the cause, says Wright.",
            "And the results highlight a role for AlphaFold in studying fertilisation, he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re limited in terms of experiments,\u201d he says. \u201cIt might be that these modelling studies have an important role to play in the future.\u201d",

Each group discussed three questions related to UK public policy, sharing their personal opinions on each.

            "Alongside the AI, one participant was chosen to be a mediator. They were also told to produce a summary that best incorporated all participant\u2019s views. Participants were shown both the AI\u2019s and the mediator\u2019s final summaries, and asked to rate them.",

In this scenario, group agreement on contentious topics increased after interacting with the AI. This finding suggests that if incorporated into a real citizen\u2019s assembly, AI tools could make it easier for leaders to produce policy proposals that take different perspectives into account.",
