            "A study has raised concerns that a type of genetic database that is increasingly popular with researchers could be exploited to reveal the identities of its participants, or link private health information to their public genetic profiles.",
            "Single-cell data sets can contain information on gene expression in millions of cells collected from thousands of people. They are often freely accessible, providing a valuable resource for researchers who study the effects of diseases at a cellular level. The data are supposed to be anonymized, but a study published on 2 October in Cell1 shows how genetic data from one study \u201ccan be exploited to uncover private information about individuals in another study\u201d, the authors write.",
            "The findings highlight the difficulty of balancing the interests of researchers with the privacy of donors. \u201cOur genomes are very identifying. They can tell a lot about us, our traits, our predisposition to diseases,\u201d says study co-author Gamze G\u00fcrsoy, a bioinformatics researcher at Columbia University in New York City. \u201cYou can change your credit-card number if it leaks, but you cannot change your genome.\u201d",
            "h2Sensitive data",
            "Concerns around privacy in genetic data sets have been raised before, but they mainly focused on \u2018bulk\u2019 genetic data sets. These contain information on gene activity averaged across a large population of cells rather than data of an individual cell.",
            "It was previously thought that single-cell data sets wouldn\u2019t be as vulnerable to privacy leaks, owing to the level of \u2018noise\u2019, or variation in gene expression, between different cells. But G\u00fcrsoy and her colleagues demonstrated that was not the case.",
            "The team reviewed three publically available single-cell data sets, which included blood cells from people with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease. The researchers found that they could use data on gene expressionto predict the structure of a person\u2019s genome, by combining these values with information on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The details of eQTLs \u2014 variations on the chromosome that correlate with gene expression \u2014 are also publically available on single-cell data sets.",
            "\n\nSupercharged crime-scene DNA analysis sparks privacy concerns\n",
            "To test the reliability of their work, the researchers checked their genome predictions against a genome database corresponding with the cells they used. They were able to link most of the data sets to their corresponding genome, with an accuracy rate of more than 80%.",
            "Unlike the data on gene expression and eQTLs, full-genome databases can usually be accessed only by scientists, to protect donor\u2019s identifying information. But the researchers point out that a participant\u2019s genome data can be publically available elsewhere. For example, they might have uploaded it to a genealogy website in which users send DNA samples to learn more about their ancestry. In this case, an attacker could identify an individual whose cells are in a single-cell data set using their genome. This could reveal personal data related to a sensitive trait such as a psychiatric disorder, given that research participants are often selected to study the biology of these complex conditions.",
            "Privacy breaches like these could have real-world implications, such as causing employment discrimination, says G\u00fcrsoy. She adds that any leaks could even have repercussions for future generations, given that genetic traits can be passed to offspring. \u201cAnything that leaks about us will perpetuate through generations,\u201d she says.",
            "Bradley Malin, who researches large-scale genomic data sharing at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, says that the study is a \u201cnovel extension and contribution to the literature\u201d. He adds that future research could explore whether genomic data could still be linked in larger data sets that include samples from thousands or millions of people.",
            "h2Competing interests",
            "Scientists are unsure about how best to tackle these privacy concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s the desire to protect individual privacy, but also the desire to collectively advance medical research, and those are, unfortunately, at odds with each other,\u201d says Mark Gerstein, who researches medical data science at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The simplest solution would be to stop making genetic data so easily accessible, but this would negatively affect research, he says. \u201cWe need to share and aggregate large amounts of information.\u201d he says. \u201cLocking it down and making it more private, really, just gums that whole process up.\u201d",
            "In their study, G\u00fcrsoy and her colleagues say that there should be greater transparency about the risks for participants who share their genomic data, and suggest that researchers should ensure that donors give consent for their data being shared. Another way forward could be encrypting personal data when it is part of a public database. The authors acknowledge that doing this would complicate the process of building and maintaining data sets, but say that it could help to protect participants\u2019 privacy.",

            "The retraction of a high-profile paper1 that tested ways to improve the soundness of scientific studies has highlighted the challenges of such \u2018reproducibility\u2019 research. The retracted paper\u2019s authors include some of the titans in the field.",
            "In the study, published in Nature Human Behaviour last November, the authors described a rigorous research protocol involving features such as large sample sizes, with the goal of ensuring the soundness of psychological experiments. The authors applied their protocol to dozens of research projects. They reported that as a result, 86% of replication attempts confirmed the expected results \u2014 one of the highest such \u201creplication rates\u201d ever recorded by such studies. But the journal\u2019s editors retracted the paper on 23 September, stating in the retraction notice2 that they \u201cno longer have confidence in the reliability of the findings and conclusions\u201d.",
            "The authors agree with only one of the journal\u2019s concerns, which the authors attribute to an innocent oversight. One of the authors, Jonathan Schooler, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told Nature that the group is working on a new version of the manuscript for resubmission.",
            "Researchers following the case say it highlights the problems with an open-science tenet: preregistration, the practice of specifying, in writing, a study\u2019s details, including the hypothesis and planned analyses, before the research is performed, in a bid to stamp out data manipulation and selective reporting of results.",
            "\u201cWhat this shows is that doing good science is hard, much harder than most people seem to think,\u201d says Sam Schwarzkopf, a visual neuroscientist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. \u201cMore often than not, preregistration makes people realize that their thoughtful plans don\u2019t pan out when faced with the cold hard reality of data collection.\u201d",
            "h2Four teams and 64 replication efforts",
            "The paper described a complex and sprawling effort: four research teams each performed preregistered pilot studies in the social-behavioural sciences. One of the studies, for example, examined whether time pressure skewed decision-making3. If the pilot study discovered an effect, the team tried to confirm the results in a sample of at least 1,500 people. All four teams attempted to replicate the experiments selected for confirmation, to see whether they would get the same results. Each team tried to replicate four of its own experiments and four from each of the three other teams.",
            "\n\nPeer-replication model aims to address science\u2019s \u2018reproducibility crisis\u2019\n",
            "Of the 64 replication efforts, 86% were successful \u2014 that is, they yielded the expected results, and those results were statistically significant. By contrast, other replication studies in the social-behavioural sciences have reported replication rates of 50%, on average.",
            "The authors of the retracted study attributed their high replication rate to \u201crigour-enhancing practices\u201d such as large sample sizes, preregistration and transparency about methods. Adoption of such practices could help to make studies more reliable, the authors wrote.",
            "Shortly after the paper\u2019s publication, Joseph Bak-Coleman, a social scientist at the University of Konstanz in Germany, and Berna Devezer, who studies marketing at the University of Idaho in Moscow, questioned its validity in a preprint4 that was uploaded to the PsyArXiv server. They noted that the authors had not preregistered some of the paper\u2019s elements, including its central question: would the authors\u2019 protocol increase reproducibility? Separately, Bak-Coleman sent pages of analysis to the editors of Nature Human Behaviour, who began an investigation that ultimately led to the retraction.",
            "In a commentary5 accompanying the retraction, Bak-Coleman and Devezer wrote that \u201creplicability was not the original outcome of interest in the project, and analyses associated with replicability were not preregistered as claimed\u201d. The retraction notice echoed those statements. (Nature Human Behaviour is published by Springer Nature, which also publishes Nature. Nature\u2019s news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)",
            "h2An authorial admission",
            "The day of the retraction, six of the Nature Human Behaviour authors published an account of their side of the story6. In it, they admit that some of the study\u2019s analyses were not preregistered. But they call other statements in the retraction notice \u201cinaccurate\u201d, such as the journal\u2019s finding that the authors had knowledge of the data when performing the analyses. The journal disagrees that the retraction notice contains inaccuracies.",
            "Brian Nosek, the executive director of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a co-author of the retracted study, says that it was shocking to find that the error in preregistration had slipped through their project-management processes. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times I read that paper with these erroneous claims about everything being preregistered and missed it. It was just a screw up,\u201d he says.",
            "Nosek, who is considered a pioneer in preregistration, also says that, from the outset, the purpose of the project was replicability, contrary to Bak-Coleman and Devezer\u2019s critique.",
            "h2Preregistration challenges",
            "The saga illustrates the shortcomings with preregistration, says Yoel Inbar, a psychologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of preregistrations that were vague, that weren\u2019t followed exactly, or where the final paper kind of mixed together the preregistered and non-preregistered analysis,\u201d he says.",
            "\n\nReproducibility trial: 246 biologists get different results from same data sets\n",
            "Inbar is increasingly convinced that a better option is the preregistration format called registered reports, in which researchers submit their study protocol, including their rationale and methods, to a journal for peer review before collecting data. Editors decide whether to accept the study on the basis of the importance of the research question and rigour of the methods, and commit to publish the results if the work is performed as described.",
            "Others say that the journal is part of the problem. Anne Scheel, a metascientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, says that although the authors erred, the editors should have noticed the missing preregistration. Peer reviewers don\u2019t always check preregistration, and big journals such as Nature Human Behaviour \u201cneed processes to actually review preregistration\u201d, she says.",
            "A spokesperson for the journal says it is investigating changes to its practices. \u201cThe journal is looking into ways to improve transparency, standardization and reporting requirements for preregistration in the social and behavioural sciences, which will strengthen efforts to monitor compliance with preregistration,\u201d the spokesperson adds.",
            "h2Time sink for all",
            "Sprawling projects in which several research groups attempt the same experiments are difficult to manage, says Olavo Amaral, a reproducibility researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. He speaks from experience: he runs the Brazilian Reproducibility Project, an attempt to reproduce the results of scores of biomedical studies performed in laboratories in the country. \u201cWe keep finding mistakes,\u201d he says.",
            "He says that the criticism of the retracted paper must be addressed, but the problems do not shake his opinion of the work. \u201cThe results look pretty replicable,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the preregistration criticism changes my mind a lot about the paper.\u201d",

The next step will be \u201cworking with the local community and the local institutions\u201d, Malhi says. \u201cThere are potentially descendants, or a descendant community that may or may not want this type of analysis done, or maybe they do \u2014 we just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",

The RNA viruses were identified using metagenomics, in which scientists sample all the genomes present in the environment without having to culture individual viruses. The method shows the potential of AI to explore the \u2018dark matter\u2019 of the RNA virus universe.",

There is \u201cessentially a bottomless pit\u201d of viruses to discover, says Artem Babaian, a computational virologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. Some of these viruses could cause diseases in people, which means that characterizing them could help to explain mystery illnesses, he says.",

            "But RNA viruses evolve quickly, so existing methods for identifying RNA viruses in genomic sequence data probably miss many. A common method is to look for a section of the genome that encodes a key protein used in RNA replication, called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). But if the sequence that encodes this protein in a virus is vastly different from any known sequence, researchers won\u2019t recognize it.",

They then trained their model to recognize viral RdRps and used it to find sequences that encoded these enzymes \u2014 evidence that those sequences belonged to a virus \u2014 in the large tranche of genomic data. Using this method, they identified some 160,000 RNA viruses, including some that were exceptionally long and found in extreme environments such as hot springs, salt lakes and air. Just under half of them had not been described before. They found \u201clittle pockets of RNA virus biodiversity that are really far off in the boonies of evolutionary space\u201d, says Babaian.",

Characterizing viruses will help researchers to understand the microbes\u2019 origins and how they evolved in different hosts, she says.",
            "And expanding the pool of known viruses makes it easier to find more viruses that are similar, says Babaian. \u201cAll of a sudden you can see things that you just weren\u2019t seeing before.\u201d",

So, if the Nobels were being launched today, would their formula need to be different?",
            "\u201cPersonally I would say the criteria for Nobel prizes would not have to be significantly modified, but remain effective in the way Alfred Nobel intended,\u201d says chemist Bengt Nord\u00e9n at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, who was chair of the chemistry Nobel Committee for three years.",
            "One obvious question is whether the categories of the awards adequately cover the core of scientific research. The Nobels are assigned loosely to the classical natural-sciences triumvirate of physics, chemistry and biology. But there is clearly some latitude in those boundaries. The physics awards have reached into fields including nonlinear dynamics and astronomy. The chemistry prizes, meanwhile, have ventured into Earth sciences, such as the 1995 prize for work on the ozone layer and atmospheric chemistry. This year\u2019s chemistry and physics prizes both centred on artificial intelligence (AI).",

The Breakthrough prizes, founded by a group of technology entrepreneurs including Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg, give annual awards in fundamental physics, life sciences and mathematics.",

Some argue that this doesn\u2019t reflect the way science has become highly collaborative since Nobel\u2019s day.

But they proved useful and have been built on widely. Neural networks that mimic human learning form the basis of many state-of-the-art AI tools, from large language models to machine-learning algorithms capable of analysing large swathes of data, including the protein-structure-prediction model AlphaFold.",
            "Speaking by telephone during the physics-prize announcement, Hinton said that learning he had won the Nobel was \u201ca bolt from the blue\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted, I had no idea this would happen,\u201d he said. He added that advances in machine learning \u201cwill have a huge influence, it will be comparable with the industrial revolution. But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it\u2019s going to exceed people in intellectual ability\u201d.",
            "In recent years, Hinton has become one of the loudest voices calling for safeguards to be placed around AI. He says he became convinced last year that digital computation had become better than the human brain, thanks to its ability to share learning from multiple copies of an algorithm, running in parallel. \u201cIt made me think [that these systems are] going to become more intelligent than us sooner than I thought,\u201d he said on 31 May, speaking virtually to the AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva, Switzerland. \u201cUp until that point, I\u2019d spent 50 years thinking that if we could only make it more like the brain, it will be better.\u201d",

            "Hopfield\u2019s \u201cmotivation was really physics, and he invented this model of physics to understand certain phases of matter\u201d, says Karl Jansen, a physicist at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY) in Zeuthen, who describes the work as \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d.

Hinton\u2019s seminal work and infectious enthusiasm made him a great role model for Bengio and other early proponents of neural networks. \u201cIt inspired me incredibly when I was just a university student,\u201d says Bengio, who is scientific director of Mila \u2014 Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute in Montreal, Canada. For decades, many computer scientists regarded neural-network research as fruitless, says Bengio, but there was a turning point in 2012, when Hinton and others used the technology to win a major image-recognition competition.",

Versions of Hopfield\u2019s network models have been useful to neuroscientists, she says, for investigating how neurons work together in memory and navigation. His model, which describes memories as low points of a surface, helps researchers to visualize how certain thoughts or anxieties can get fixed and retrieved in the brain, she adds. \u201cI love to use this as a metaphor to talk to people when they are stuck.\u201d",

Now, one of the biggest studies1 of dietary restrictions ever conducted in laboratory animals challenges the conventional wisdom about how dietary restriction boosts longevity.",
            "The study, involving nearly 1,000 mice fed low-calorie diets or subjected to regular bouts of fasting, found that such regimens do indeed cause weight loss and related metabolic changes. But other factors \u2014 including immune health, genetics and physiological indicators of resiliency \u2014 seem to better explain the link between cutting calories and increased lifespan.",

            "Scientists have long known that caloric restriction, a regimen of long-term limits on food intake, lengthens lifespan in laboratory animals2. Some studies3,4 have shown that intermittent fasting, which involves short bouts of food deprivation, can also increase longevity.",
            "To learn more about how such diets work, the researchers monitored the health and longevity of 960 mice, each a genetically distinct individual drawn from a diverse population that mirrors the genetic variability found in humans. Some mice were placed on calorie-limited diets, another group followed intermittent fasting regimens, and others were allowed to eat freely.",

            "Cutting calories by 40% yielded the longest longevity bump, but intermittent fasting and less severe calorie restriction also increased average lifespan. The dieting mice also displayed favourable metabolic changes, such as reductions in body fat and blood sugar levels.",
            "However, the effects of dietary restriction on metabolism and lifespan didn\u2019t always change in lockstep. To the authors\u2019 surprise, the mice that lost the most weight on a calorie-limited diet tended to die younger than did animals that lost relatively modest amounts.",
            "This suggests that processes beyond simple metabolic regulation drive how the body responds to limited-calorie regimes. What mattered most for lengthening lifespan were traits related to immune health and red-blood-cell function. Also key was overall resilience, presumably encoded in the animals\u2019 genes, to the stress of reduced food intake.",

In one of the most comprehensive clinical trials of a low-calorie diet in healthy, non-obese individuals, researchers found5 that the intervention helped to dial down metabolic rates \u2014 a short-term effect thought to signal longer-term benefits for lifespan.",
            "But the mouse data from Churchill\u2019s team suggest that metabolic measurements might reflect \u2018healthspan\u2019 \u2014 the period of life spent free from chronic disease and disability \u2014 but that other metrics are needed to say whether such \u2018anti-ageing\u2019 strategies can truly extend life.",

To try to reduce that number, Huston and his colleagues are developing a treatment that targets the vagus nerves, which are large networks of nerve fibres that link the body with the brain. Despite its name, the treatment does not work like a typical tourniquet that blocks blood flow to injured appendages. Instead, the electrical pulses help to stimulate the spleen, which stores about one-third of the body\u2019s platelets. The stimulation prods the spleen to ready platelets to form a clot.",

            "The team also tested the treatment on mice with haemophilia, a condition in which the blood does not clot properly, and found similar results3. The experiment also hinted at how nerve stimulation achieves these results: it increases calcium uptake by platelets in the spleen and makes them more ready to release their innards when they reach an injured blood vessel. Both actions are key to clot formation.",
            "Last year, Huston and Spark Biomedical, a biotechnology firm based in Dallas, Texas, launched a trial of the treatment in 30 people. In some participants, the researchers applied mild electric currents to one of two stimulation sites near the ear; control participants received sham stimulation. The preliminary results show that the treatment modestly increases clot stability and platelet activation.",

Huston is still analysing data about whether the treatment could lead to excessive clotting elsewhere in the body, but he says that nerve stimulation has been used safely for decades, giving him no reason for concern.",

            "\u201cThere are very few controls and there is very little knowledge, I think, by the government fishery departments about the value, importance and potential threats of this,\u201d says Sadovy. The consequence is \u201ca sort of cowboy frontier\u201d, whereby high prices push fishers to target species that \u201cwe hardly know anything about in terms of the science\u201d.",

In her early years in the Kikori region, she was focused on how hunting and habitat changes were threatening the pig-nosed turtle. The work took her to far-flung villages to monitor nesting sites, survey the consumption of turtle meat and eggs, and build community awareness about the vulnerability of the creatures known as piku.",
            "By 2019 she was known locally as mama piku, and was the director of a small conservation organization, the Piku Biodiversity Network, which she still runs. Amid the other changes in the region, the fish-maw trade had become yet another threat to the turtle\u2019s survival because the animals were getting tangled in commercial gillnets that seafood companies were supplying to local fishers.",

            "The remoteness and logistical difficulties of working in the Kikori delta \u2014 a region with little electrical power, few roads, fragmentary communications and 4\u20138 metres of rainfall a year \u2014 mean that Amepou, Grant and their collaborators are among just a handful of researchers who are active in the area. With support from the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), a multinational organization focused on the region\u2019s natural resources, they collected data on targeted maw species, as well as by-catch. A survey of landings in gillnets reported by fishers from five delta communities over six months to April 2022 found that the hunt for fish maw pulls up huge numbers of non-target fish and mammals3.",
            "Elasmobranchs \u2014 a subclass of fish that includes sharks and rays \u2014 accounted for almost half the catch, whereas target species made up just 22%. Among the other casualties were several species listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, including three species of hammerhead shark, the giant guitarfish (Glaucostegus typus) and the bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae), alongside various vulnerable river sharks and critically endangered Indo-Pacific sawfishes (Pristidae)2.",
            "Other reports, some unpublished, document declines in two endemic dolphin species that have small local populations and are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. On one occasion, fishers reported that ten dolphins drowned in a single net, says Amepou. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the very real possibility of a local extinction if nothing is done about the gillnets in the water,\u201d she says.",
            "But discussions with local people about curtailing fishing practices for conservation purposes are acutely sensitive given the money flowing into the economically disadvantaged region. \u201cWhile local fishers acknowledge sustainability concerns, the overarching feeling is everyone is pretty happy for now,\u201d says Grant. \u201cWhether fish-maw money is going back into community and development remains to be seen, and this is our next research focus.\u201d",
            "In 2022, the researchers submitted a report to SPREP on the Kikori maw fishery, urging the development of a management plan3. Sources have told Nature that work on a plan has commenced, but Papua New Guinea\u2019s authorities did not respond to questions from Nature on its progress. In 2021, the National Fisheries Authority stopped issuing new fish-maw licences in Gulf Province, where the Kikori delta is located, and in the neighbouring Western Province, owing to increasing illegal, unregulated and unreported activities in the two fisheries.",

            "After storm surges destroyed many houses in the delta village of Veraibari in 2020, the people formed a relocation committee. They plan to use the windfall maw money to build around 200 homes, a school, a market and churches a short distance inland from the beach where they currently live. The committee estimates that this plan will cost 1,689,000 Papua New Guinean kina (US$431,000). In recent years, waves have damaged and closed the schoolhouse, knocked down freshwater tanks and submerged burial grounds. Abandoned homes decay on their stilts in the shallows alongside the stumps of drowned palm trees.",

When the big tides come, his family wades into the sea to push away debris that might tip their home off its legs.",
            "Kouwo is also the local agent buying maw for one of the six seafood companies, all Asian-led, with licences in Gulf Province. He conducts business at his family table, weighing and trading fish maw, offering 5,000 to 6,000 kina per 100 grams for the finest specimens. He kicked off the relocation fund with his own earnings, urging his neighbours and relatives to provide cash or other contributions. They are lobbying for more government support, but have so far received only sandbags to build a seawall, which soon failed, and some iron roofing, nails and a sawmill to help with the relocation. Money earned from fishing is the only way to save the village, he says, although he recognizes the risks.",

She and others urged authorities in Hong Kong, the global trade hub for maw, to introduce a specific code for fish maw separate from other dried fish, which they did in 2015. Data collected using this new code revealed that between 2015 and 2018, 3,144\u20133,882 tonnes of dried maw, worth $264 million to $394 million, were imported to Hong Kong every year4. These were shockingly high numbers, Sadovy says, \u201cbecause you might have 3,000 tonnes of maw, but maw is only 5% of the weight of the animal. So that\u2019s tonnes and tonnes of animal, so you begin to think about the scale of those fisheries\u201d.",

Concern over the trade has grown in the years since then. In 2021, in response to the high prices being paid for maw in Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, India and French Guiana, the IUCN adopted a motion urging nations to control and monitor trade in the swim bladders of a group of ray-finned fishes known as big croakers to both protect the target species and reduce by-catch of threatened marine megafauna.",

            "Ever since the first quantum computers were dreamt up in the early 1980s, researchers have looked forward to the day the devices could solve problems that are too difficult for classical computers. In the past five years, the machines have finally begun to challenge their classical cousins \u2014 although definitive victory over them has remained elusive.",
            "Now, in the latest chapter of the battle to achieve this \u2018quantum advantage\u2019, researchers at Google say they have determined the conditions under which quantum computers can beat their classical counterparts. To understand these conditions, they used a quantum-computer processor named Sycamore to run random circuit sampling (RCS), a simple quantum algorithm that essentially generates a random sequence of values.",
            "\n\nGoogle\u2019s quantum computer hits key milestone by reducing errors\n",
            "The team analysed Sycamore\u2019s output and found that when it ran in a mode with a lot of noise interference while performing RCS, it could be \u2018spoofed\u2019, or beaten, by classical supercomputers. But, when the noise was lowered to a certain threshold, Sycamore\u2019s computation became complex enough that spoofing it was effectively impossible \u2014 by some estimates, it would take the fastest classical supercomputer in the world ten trillion years. The finding, first reported in a preprint on the arXiv server last year, was published today in Nature1.",
            "This is a convincing demonstration that Sycamore is capable of outpacing any classical computer running RCS, quantum specialists told Nature. In 2019, Google reported that its quantum computer could run RCS and achieve a quantum advantage, but since then classical computers have been able to run the algorithm more quickly than estimated, eliminating the purported advantage. This time around, \u201cGoogle did a very good job of both clarifying and addressing many of the known issues with RCS\u201d, says Michael Foss-Feig, a quantum-computing researcher at the computer software firm Quantinuum, who is based in Broomfield, Colorado. And the new findings show how much noise quantum computers can have and still beat classical computers, he says.",

It has motivated researchers to build bigger and higher-quality quantum computers.",

            "Rather than using classical bits (which are always either a 0 or 1) as a regular computer does, the quantum chip relies on qubits, which harness the electrons\u2019 ability to be in a mixture of states. A quantum computer can conduct some tasks with exponentially fewer qubits than the bits a classical computer would need. For example, to run the RCS algorithm, a classical computer would need 1,024 bits and a quantum computer would need 10 qubits.",
            "Five years ago, a team of Google researchers reported in Nature2 that to match a 200-second RCS run on their 53-qubit computer, it would take a classical supercomputer 10,000 years. Almost immediately, the claim came under fire; researchers at the technology giant IBM posted a preprint online3, ahead of peer review, which suggested that a supercomputer could actually complete the task in days. In June, Lu and his colleagues used powerful classical computers to spoof the result in just over one minute4.",
            "Google\u2019s 2019 result is not the only one that has fallen to classical spoofing. In June 2023, IBM researchers and others reported evidence5 that their 127-qubit computer could solve potentially useful maths problems that were \u201cbeyond brute-force classical computation\u201d. Within weeks, multiple studies6,7 showed that classical approaches could still compete.",

            "Within the past two years, attempts to beat classical supercomputers have also focused on reducing qubit noise.
