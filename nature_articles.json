It\u2019s a valuable thing that they do and we should recognize, reward it,\u201d Armstrong said last month at the launch of the ResearchHub Journal in San Francisco, California. The move comes as Bitcoin \u2014 the world\u2019s most established cryptocurrency \u2014 reached an all-time-high value of US$100,000, fuelling renewed fervour for the notoriously volatile sector.",

            "Armstrong first floated the idea for ResearchHub in a 2019 blogpost in which he expressed frustration at the speed and quality of scientific research. He suggested that science should operate in a similar way to open-source software, where users build on each others work, with elements of successful online platforms such as social-media site Reddit, the code repository GitHub and crowd-funding website Kickstarter. As part of his plan, he wanted to provide a viable alternative to conventional journals.",
            "The ResearchHub Journal promises that preprints uploaded to the site will be peer reviewed within 14 days and a publication decision will be made in seven days after that. Authors pay a $1,000 article-processing charge (APC), and papers and the accompanying peer reviews are published under a liberal CC-BY licence. The journal is yet to publish a paper and is not indexed on bibliometric databases such as Web of Science or Scopus.",
            "Authors can also earn ResearchCoin as a reward for using good research practices, such as preregistering studies and sharing data openly. Users of ResearchHub can already earn ResearchCoin for uploading preprints and papers to the site, commenting on or voting for these uploads. Users can also tip each other for good work or pay others to complete research-related tasks, such as generating data for a review. Currently, ResearchHub takes a 7% cut of any ResearchCoin transactions on the site, 2% of which is ploughed back into the community.",

He reviews an average of 15 papers a month, accounting for 70% of his income. ",

            "Many parents have applauded the tough approach, but researchers aren\u2019t convinced banning access to social media will solve the problems it is intended to address. In October, dozens of researchers penned a letter to the Australian government arguing that a blanket ban was too blunt and that addressing online risks requires a nuanced, evidence-based approach.",
            "There is a lack of evidence to suggest that a ban will be effective, says Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who focuses on how social media influences mental health. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the scientific consensus,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Evidence so far",
            "So what does the research show? A 2023 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that social media has the potential to be harmful to adolescent health, but that there is not enough evidence to suggest that it causes negative effects at the population level. Rather than bringing in blanket bans and age restrictions, the report recommends that social-media companies adopt new standards to improve the platforms\u2019 transparency, as well as better reporting systems to tackle online abuse.",
            "Australia is one of several countries or regions to attempt to impose social-media restrictions on children. In 2023, France introduced a law that prohibits children under the age of 15 from signing up for social-media accounts without parental consent, although it is yet to be enforced. The US state of Florida signed a bill in March that seeks to ban social-media accounts for children younger than 14 years old, but the move is being challenged in the district court over concerns about free speech. And in October, Norway announced plans to increase the minimum age for social-media use from 13 to 15 years old.",

            "On 25 June, Li Chunlai watched eagerly as a capsule carrying the first pieces of the far side of the Moon landed on Earth. \u201cSample, I finally got you,\u201d he thought, as if speaking to an adversary he had spent years trying to outwit.",
            "That moment capped decades of hard work for Li, deputy chief designer for China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-6 mission, which blasted off to the Moon on 3 May. The 3,200-kilogram lander \u2014 about as heavy as a pickup truck \u2014 spent two days drilling and scooping material on the lunar surface before sending the samples back to Earth.",
            "",
            "Li was central to deciding where on the Moon the spacecraft would land and was among the first to analyse the rocks it ferried back. He and his team of 70 or so staff members oversee the data collected during China\u2019s space missions, and that includes storing and distributing samples. \u201cWhat he is really good at, is coordination,\u201d says James Head, a planetary geoscientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who has collaborated extensively with Li.",
            "When he was a young researcher studying geology and cosmic chemistry, Li says he never imagined holding samples from the Moon. But he has been involved in determining the science objectives of China\u2019s lunar exploration programme since its inception, when Chang\u2019e-1 was sent to orbit the Moon in 2007. This is Li\u2019s second sample-return mission for the China National Space Administration. He had a similar role during the Chang\u2019e-5 mission, which brought back soil and rock from the Moon\u2019s near side.",
            "The latest shipment, containing almost two kilograms of lunar material from the hemisphere hidden from Earth\u2019s view, could unravel many mysteries about the Moon\u2019s early evolution, and the planets beyond, say researchers.",
            "\u201cWe have been dreaming of having samples from the far side of the Moon,\u201d says Patrick Pinet, a planetary scientist at the Research Institute in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France.",
            "One day after arriving on Earth, the capsule was in Li\u2019s laboratory at the National Astronomical Observatories in Beijing. It took Li and his team several days of banging, twisting and clanging to release the precious material from its sealed vault, using various tools. To protect the material, they stored it in a nitrogen-filled box. The powder within was \u201cfluffy\u201d and \u201cvery fresh\u201d, says Li. The samples are lighter in colour than are those from the Moon\u2019s near side. \u201cIt\u2019s very special,\u201d says Li.",
            "The rocks and dust were collected from the deepest part of the South Pole\u2013Aitken Basin, which is assumed to be the largest and oldest impact crater on the Moon. The site was chosen because of the diversity of the material it might contain, such as lava flows and fragments of the lunar crust or even the mantle beneath. The samples are \u201clike a recorder of all these historical events\u201d, says Yi Xu, a planetary scientist at Macau University of Science and Technology.",

            "Early this year, cases of mpox erupted across Central Africa, killing hundreds. Seeing the events unfold so soon after the still-simmering outbreak of 2022 \u201cfelt like scientific amnesia\u201d, says Placide Mbala, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).",
            "Mbala led a team of researchers who sounded the alarm about the latest outbreak when they spotted a suspicious cluster of mpox cases among young adults and sex workers in an eastern region of the DRC. The team predicted that the disease would move quickly and urged health officials both in the DRC and in neighbouring countries to devise plans to contain the monkeypox virus\u2019s spread.",
            "",
            "He and his colleagues analysed the genome of the virus (E. H. Vakaniaki et al. Nature Med. 30, 2791\u20132795; 2024), revealing that it was a new strain, capable of passing from human to human and distinct from the virus that caused the 2022 outbreak and other previous outbreaks in the DRC. It has since been detected in Sweden, Thailand, India, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and six African countries that had never before reported mpox infections.",
            "Mbala has been instrumental in leading these research projects, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who collaborates with Mbala. Furthermore, Mbala has \u201cbeen coordinating response and community-engagement activities across the country, and doing all this in the least selfish, most diplomatic and democratic ways\u201d, Kindrachuk adds.",
            "It\u2019s a role that Mbala has long trained for. After finishing medical school in 2006 and spending a year as a clinician in Kinshasa, he met Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, a microbiologist who directs the centre where Mbala works. Mbala was impressed by Muyembe-Tamfum\u2019s work \u2014 in particular his dogged efforts to find the animal reservoir of Ebola, having co-discovered the Ebola virus in 1976. Muyembe-Tamfum took Mbala under his wing, and in 2008 they worked to improve the country\u2019s capacity for mpox testing and treatment. Later, Mbala helped to diagnose and confirm, through genetic sequencing, the first infections with the Ebola virus during the DRC\u2019s 2014 outbreak.",

            "Around three out of every four PDF versions of scholarly papers are largely inaccessible to low-vision and blind readers, a study has found1.",
            "Researchers looked at how often around 20,000 studies published between 2014 and 2023 were compliant with 6 accessibility criteria. That includes providing alternative text for figures and headers for tables, as well as adding the tags necessary to make PDF files accessible to low-vision and blind readers, who typically access these files using assistive reading devices.",
            "Only around 3% of the analysed studies met all six criteria, the analysis found, and just under 75% met none of the criteria at all. ",
            "\u201cAfter 2019, there was a very sharp decline across almost all of the criteria that we measured,\u201d says study co-author Anukriti Kumar, an information scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors attribute that trend to the move towards rapid-publishing methods such as preprints and online-first publishing, and say that it was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded quick communication of research findings.",
            "The analysis was presented in October at the 26th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility in St. John\u2019s, Canada.",
            "Lucy Lu Wang, also an information scientist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study, published2 a similar analysis of accessibility of more than 11,000 PDFs in 2021. \u201cThings were mostly improving,\u201d she recalls. But with new global open-access policies and changes with how publishers are producing PDFs, accessibility overall has decreased since then,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cAccessibility often falls to the wayside, because it disproportionately affects a smaller group of people,\u201d Wang says, \u201cor the kind of people who don\u2019t have as much clout.\u201d",
            "h2Systemic changes required",
            "For the 2021 analysis, the authors interviewed several low-vision and blind scientists, some of whom said that they chose their fields of study in part because of how easily accessible the associated literature was. \u201cPeople were drawn to fields that had more accessible papers,\u201d Wang says. \u201cThe barriers to working in those fields were lower.\u201d",
            "Sheri Wells-Jensen, a linguistics researcher at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who is fully blind, tells Nature that the hassle of finding accessible papers is such that she sometimes doesn\u2019t even try. \u201cI never expect to be able to go to an open-access journal and just get the PDF and read it with the same level of ease and convenience as other scientists do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got different software that could do some scanning, but you have to be a little bit of a wizard sometimes.\u201d",
            "Wells-Jensen notes that academic journals rarely provide information about accessibility for scientists with visual impairment in the \u2018information for authors\u2019 sections of their websites, making it unclear how researchers should prepare their manuscripts for optimal accessibility. Manuscript-submission systems themselves are also often inaccessible, she adds.",
            "Addressing such accessibility shortfalls will require \u201csystemic changes\u201d from authors, publishers and others, Kumar says.",
