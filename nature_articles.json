            "Last week, technology giants Google and Amazon both unveiled deals supporting \u2018advanced\u2019 nuclear energy, as part of their efforts to become carbon-neutral.",
            "Google announced that it will buy electricity made with reactors developed by Kairos Power, based in Alameda, California. Meanwhile, Amazon is investing approximately US$500 million in the X-Energy Reactor Company, based in Rockville, Maryland, and has agreed to buy power produced by X-energy-designed reactors due to be built in Washington State.",
            "Nuclear power for AI: what it will take to reopen Three Mile Island safely",
            "Both moves are part of a larger green trend that has arisen as tech companies deal with the escalating energy requirements of the data centres and number-crunching farms that support artificial intelligence (AI). Last month, Microsoft said it would buy power from a utility company that is planning to restart a decommissioned 835-megawatt reactor in Pennsylvania.",
            "The partnerships agreed by Google and Amazon involve start-up companies that are pioneering the design of \u2018small modular reactors\u2019, which are intended to be assembled from prefabricated pieces. The idea is to make nuclear reactors that are smaller, cheaper, safer and faster to deploy than those used in conventional plants. The designs pursued by X-energy, Kairos and several other companies (funded, in part, by institutions such as the US Department of Energy and the European Commission) are radically different from those of established energy companies, but they still have a way to go before they become a reality.",
            "Nature talked to nuclear-energy researchers to explore the significance and possible implications of these big-tech investments.",
            "h2Could these deals spur innovation in the nuclear industry?",
            "Building nuclear power stations \u2014 a process often plagued by complex permit procedures, construction delays and cost overruns \u2014 is financially risky, and betting on unproven technologies is riskier still. But the deals with Google and Amazon could provide a \u201cmassive\u201d push for Kairos and X-energy, says nuclear engineer Jacopo Buongiorno, who heads up the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. \u201cThe biggest value is a vote of confidence, and of course it comes with some cash,\u201d he says. Such announcements could help companies to raise extra funding, he says, and jump over the \u2018innovation valley of death\u2019 that often separates promising ideas from commercial success.",
            "But the details of the deals are murky, and the level of support provided by Amazon and Google is likely to be \u201ca drop in the bucket\u201d compared with the billions these start-ups will ultimately need, says physicist Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC. \u201cThe PR machine is just going into overdrive,\u201d says Lyman, but \u201cprivate capital just doesn\u2019t seem ready yet to take that risk\u201d.",
            "Allison Macfarlane, director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and former chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), says that the speed of progress in computer science raises another question. \u201cIf we\u2019re talking 15 years from now, will AI need that much power?\u201d",
            "h2How do small modular reactors work?",
            "A number of start-up companies \u2014 as well as some established corporations, including Toshiba and Rolls Royce \u2014 are developing small reactors, and each claims its own originality and advantages. Most are pursuing designs that are different from those that have been used so far for electricity production.",
            "Nuclear energy, ten years after Fukushima",
            "In almost all types of nuclear reactor, the source of energy is the splitting of uranium atoms. A nucleus of the unstable isotope uranium-235 breaks up when hit by a neutron, and this releases more neutrons, which hit more nuclei, leading to a chain reaction. A conventional nuclear power station extracts the resulting energy \u2014 released as heat \u2014 by pumping cold water through the reactor\u2019s core and producing pressurized steam to power turbines that generate electricity.",
            "X-energy\u2019s design replaces the water with helium, whereas Kairos plans to use molten salt. Both forgo the conventional nuclear-fuel rods, replacing them with thousands of round fuel \u2018pebbles\u2019. The pebbles are continually added at the top of the reactor, while spent pebbles are removed from the bottom, not unlike the way a gumball vending machine works.",
            "h2Are there safety advantages to the small modular designs?",
            "\u201cThe smallest reactors, in theory, could have a high degree of passive safety,\u201d says Lyman. When shut down, the core of a small reactor would contain less residual heat and radioactivity than does a core of the type that melted down in the Fukushima Daiichi disaster that followed the cataclysmic 2011 tsunami in Japan.",
            "The companies also say that the proposed pebble-bed reactors are inherently safer because they are not pressurized, and because they are designed to circulate cooling fluids without the help of pumps (it was the loss of power to water pumps that caused three of the Fukushima plant\u2019s reactors to fail).",
            "But Lyman thinks it is risky to rely on potentially unpredictable passive cooling without the backup of an active cooling option. And as reactors become get smaller, they become less efficient. Another start-up company, NuScale Power, based in Portland, Oregon, originally designed its small modular reactor \u2014 which was certified by the NRC \u2014 to produce 50 MW of electricity, but later switched to a larger, 77-MW design. The need to make the economics work \u201cmakes passive safety less credible\u201d, Lyman says.",
            "h2Do small modular reactors carry extra risks?",
            "In some cases, small modular reactors \u201ccould actually push nuclear power in a more dangerous direction\u201d, says Lyman. \u201cAdvanced isn\u2019t always better.\u201d",
            "In particular, Lyman points out that the pebble-bed designs drawn up by X-energy and Kairos would rely on high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), which comprises 10\u201320% uranium-235 \u2014 compared with the 5% enrichment level required by most existing reactors (and by NuScale\u2019s reactor). HALEU is still classified as low-enrichment fuel (as opposed to the highly enriched uranium used to make nuclear bombs), but that distinction is misleading, Lyman says. In June, he and his collaborators \u2014 including physicist Richard Garwin, who led the design of the first hydrogen bomb \u2014 warned in a Science article that a bomb could be built with a few hundred kilograms of HALEU, with no need for further enrichment1.",

            "Smaller reactors are also likely to produce more nuclear waste and to use fuel less efficiently, according to work reported in 2022 by Macfarlane and her collaborators2. In a full-size reactor, most of the neutrons produced by the splitting of uranium travel through a large volume of fuel, meaning that they have a high probability of hitting another nucleus, rather than colliding with the walls of the reactor vessel or escaping into the surrounding building. \u201cWhen you shrink the reactor, there\u2019s less material in there, so you will have more neutron leakage,\u201d Macfarlane says. These rogue neutrons can be absorbed by other atomic nuclei \u2014 which would then themselves become radioactive.",
            "NuScale points out that the study was based, in part, on the company\u2019s now-abandoned 50-MW design, but Macfarlane and others say that the problem is likely to apply to most small reactors.",
            "h2Will small reactors be cheaper to build?",
            "The capacity to build components in an assembly line could drastically cut reactors\u2019 construction costs. But there are also intrinsic economies of scale in building larger reactors, says Buongiorno. \u201cDon\u2019t believe people blindly\u201d when they say smaller reactors will produce cheaper energy, he says: nuclear energy has a lot going for it, but \u201cit ain\u2019t cheap\u201d \u2014 and that is unlikely to change significantly.",
            "However, once the technology has been proven and has matured, building each individual small reactor should be cheaper and faster than constructing large, conventional ones, Buongiorno adds. This could make them an attractive proposition to investors and speed up their adoption.",
            "Meanwhile, Lyman and others worry that the hype surrounding small modular reactor technology \u2014 and the push to cut costs \u2014 could lower safety standards. Some companies, for example, say that their reactors are so safe that they won\u2019t need reinforced-concrete containment structures.",
            "h2Will all of these efforts help to combat climate change?",
            "\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t shut down existing nuclear power. We need it desperately, and we desperately need to get off fossil fuels,\u201d says Macfarlane. Even some lifelong opponents of nuclear power grudgingly agree.",
            "But whether building new reactors is the best way to rapidly cut emissions is debated. Macfarlane points out that solar panels and wind turbines can be deployed at a much faster rate. Other assessments, including one by the International Energy Agency, suggest that in many parts of the world, it would be prohibitively expensive to rely wholly on erratic solar and wind power, even with the addition of massive batteries \u2014 and that ready-on-demand sources, including nuclear power, will still have an important role in future energy provision3.",

The study, which was published in Science Advances on 25 October1, is the first to investigate this framework of curiosity outside of a laboratory environment.",
            "As the world\u2019s largest encyclopaedia, Wikipedia is a valuable resource for researchers exploring how people seek information. \u201cIt\u2019s super important to understand more about how people actually use the content online and how they consume knowledge,\u201d says Tiziano Piccardi, who researches how to improve the online information ecosystem at Stanford University in California. \u201cYou can translate what you learn to improve Wikipedia.\u201d",
            "h2Searching styles",
            "Previous research on how people navigate Wikipedia was with relatively few participants under controlled laboratory conditions. The authors of the latest study conducted one such experiment, in which they reviewed the Wikipedia browsing behaviour of 149 people, monitoring how they moved from article to article. There, they identified the hunter and busybody styles of curiosity2. Their most recent work builds on these earlier findings by using real-world data from hundreds of thousands of Wikipedia users.",
            "Edit-a-thon gets women scientists into Wikipedia",
            "The team wanted to know whether the previous study\u2019s findings were related to just the 149 participants, says co-author Dani Bassett, a human curiosity and learning researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cOr is this something that\u2019s consistent across hundreds of thousands of people, and across different languages and different countries?\u201d",
            "Working with the Wikimedia Foundation \u2014 Wikipedia\u2019s parent company based in San Francisco, California \u2014 the team reviewed two months of anonymized browsing data from more than 482,000 users of the Wikipedia mobile app from 50 countries and territories. These readers browsed articles in at least 14 languages.",
            "\u201cThe data that we have is basically how people walk through Wikipedia, moving from page to page,\u201d says Bassett. \u201cFrom that data, we were able to extract networks. So how do people move in this larger information space? Which hyperlinks do they walk across, and what do those networks look like for each person?\u201d",
            "h2Social butterflies",
            "The researchers found that they were able to generalize the curiosity styles found in their earlier study to this larger-scale analysis. They identified busybodies, who Bassett likens to social butterflies. There were also the hunters, who moved logically between different pages as if following a specific trail. The researchers also spotted a third style of curiosity \u2014 the dancer \u2014 that others had identified in earlier studies. This style applies to \u201csomebody who is moving between ideas in a way that is quite creative\u201d, says Bassett.",
            "AI science search engines are exploding in number \u2014 are they any good? ",
            "By comparing how browsing styles varied between countries, and considering global inequality metrics, the researchers also found \u201ca really strong relationship between the kind of browsing style that a person has and the level of equality in the country\u201d, Bassett says. For example, loose, diverse knowledge networks, in which users view a variety of topics, are associated with countries with lower gender and education inequality. Although Bassett stresses that the research team doesn\u2019t know what exactly is driving this correlation, they suggest several hypotheses, such as that societies that are unequal could also create conditions that constrain curiosity and people\u2019s desire to search for knowledge.",
            "\u201cThis is the first study that I see that is grounded in theory,\u201d says Piccardi. \u201cThese navigation patterns are really, really complex, so grounding it in some theories and finding a way to explore them.

            "Bassett agrees that people might deploy different curiosity styles in different situations, but suggests that understanding a person\u2019s preferred style could help to improve teamwork. \u201cWhen we are working with one another in teams, we can be more aware of the fact that we ask questions differently and we investigate knowledge spaces differently, and embrace that diversity.\u201d",

            "Some studies show that babies born by c-section, rather than vaginal birth, have a higher risk of asthma, inflammation of the digestive system and other diseases associated with a dysfunctional immune system1. Scientists think that these differences arise because babies born by c-section aren\u2019t exposed to and rapidly colonized by the microbes in their mothers\u2019 vaginas and guts. Studies have even shown that c-section babies are more vulnerable to pathogens in hospitals than are babies born by vaginal birth2.",
            "Do C-section babies need mum\u2019s microbes? Trials tackle controversial idea",
            "Experiments have attempted to compensate for that by swabbing babies born by c-section with microbes from their mother\u2019s vagina or giving them these microbes orally, a practice known as \u2018vaginal seeding\u2019. But this technique has had limited success, because vaginal microbes, scientists have learnt, cannot effectively colonize infants\u2019 guts, says Yan Shao, a microbiome scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK.",
            "Helve and his colleagues have been pioneers in testing whether faecal transplants can instead improve the health of a baby\u2019s microbiome. In their latest trial, which recruited women scheduled for a c-section at the Helsinki University Hospital, the researchers mixed a fluid containing 3.5 milligrams of a mother\u2019s poo into milk and gave the concoction to the corresponding baby. They did this for 15 babies during their first feed. Another 16 babies received a placebo.",
            "An analysis of the babies\u2019 poo samples showed that the two groups had similar microbial diversity at birth, but from their second day of life, there is a marked difference between the two groups, which persisted until 6 months of age, around when babies start eating solid food.",
            "C-section babies are missing key microbes",
            "The trial, which will monitor the babies during their first two years, is ongoing, but the early data align with what was seen in a small pilot study3 without a placebo group published by the same team in 2020. The researchers studied seven babies and found that the microbiomes of those that received a maternal faecal transplant developed similarly to those of babies born by vaginal delivery.",
            "Given the success of the pilot study, \u201cit isn\u2019t surprising that maternal faecal microbiota transplantation would make a difference to the c-section infant microbiota\u201d in the latest trial, Shao says. He notes that, although the trial is an important clinical study, it doesn\u2019t directly compare the microbiome of treated c-section babies with that of infants delivered vaginally \u2014 which would be needed to demonstrate that the technique effectively restores microbiomes affected by c-section.",

            "The researchers emphasize that no one should try this approach at home. Trial participants went through extensive screening. \u201cYou have to be certain that the faecal matter that you give to the newborn doesn\u2019t include pathogens that could cause a disease,\u201d Helve says. From 90 women initially included, 54 were excluded owing to the presence of pathogens or another screening failure. \u201cEven if it sounds simple, it should be well controlled,\u201d Helve adds.",
            "Helve warns that the approach is unlikely to be a good fit for every infant born by c-section. In a large enough group of children, he says, you have enough statistical power to see that some diseases, such as asthma, are more prevalent in those born by c-section. \u201cBut on an individual level, the differences are very small.\u201d So his team is studying whether groups at high risk of developing certain diseases would benefit most.",
            "An important next step in the field, Shao says, would be to pinpoint the specific maternal gut microbes that are most likely to transmit to and colonize their babies\u2019 guts.

Their study, published in Science on 24 October1, identifies thousands of tardigrade genes that become more active when exposed to radiation. These processes point to a sophisticated defence system that involves protecting DNA from the damage that radiation causes and repairing any breaks that do occur.",

A gene called DODA1, which seems to have been acquired from bacteria, enables tardigrades to produce four types of antioxidant pigments called betalains. These pigments can mop up some of the harmful reactive chemicals that radiation causes to form inside cells, which account for 60\u201370% of radiation\u2019s damaging effects.",

Researchers could also fail to reap the full benefits of protein-design competitions if contestants keep quiet about their approaches, says Anthony Gitter, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \u201cIf teams aren\u2019t communicating their methods, there\u2019s not much opportunity to learn about what work and what fails.\u201d",
            "So far, this doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. Most of the competitions encourage or even require participants to describe their approaches. The contests could also help to bring together some of the disparate fields that have been drawn to protein design \u2014 from biochemistry labs that pioneered protein engineering methods to machine-learning scientists who cut their teeth in natural-language processing, says Gitter. \u201cPeople organizing the competitions, to have maximum impact on the field, should think really hard about how to create a community.\u201d",
            "When the Adaptyv competition results were announced in late September, Naka was disappointed. Although all ten of his entries looked strong, none of his designs worked in the lab. Only 5 of the 147 designs that were tested actually bound to the target molecule. And more than 50 of them couldn\u2019t even be made.",

The winners were Martin Pacesa and Lennart Nickel, structural biologists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, who posted a preprint describing their approach and made its code open-source (M. Pacesa et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/nmfm; 2024). Adaptyv has now launched a second competition that builds on the first.",

Through the competition, he forged connections with like-minded scientists, including Gitter. \u201cIt feels like it lowered the barrier to entry and let a lot of new people participate in protein design,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be participating in similar events in the future.\u201d",

            "For the first time, researchers have accelerated muons \u2014 the heavier, unstable cousins of electrons \u2014 into a tightly controlled beam, bringing the vision of a muon collider a step closer to reality. ",
            "A team at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) in Tokai shot a laser at a stream of muons to bring the fast-moving particles to a near-standstill. Then, the researchers applied an electric field to accelerate these \u2018cooled\u2019 muons to around 4% of the speed of light. The findings, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, were posted on 15 October on the arXiv preprint server1.",
            "The feat is a \u201cgreat step forward\u201d in the approach needed to build a muon collider, which could be used to make the exquisitely sensitive measurements required to uncover new physics but be smaller and potentially cheaper to build than other particle colliders, says Tova Holmes, a particle physicist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. ",
            "Muons are short-lived fundamental particles that are almost identical to electrons, but have more than 200 times the mass. Over the past decade, there has been growing momentum towards building a compact muon collider that could match or exceed the energies achieved by sprawling proton and electron colliders, such as the 27-kilometre Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Europe\u2019s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. A 10-kilometre muon collider could produce particles that have as much energy as those from a 90-kilometre proton machine, because muons are fundamental particles, which means that all of their energy goes into each collision. By contrast, proton collisions occur between their constituent quarks.",
            "h2Tricky particles",
            "But muons are fiendishly difficult to accelerate because they only exist for around 2 microseconds before they decay into an electron and two types of neutrino. They also dart around in different directions at various speeds, making them difficult to tame into a narrow, high-intensity beam. Although researchers have accelerated muons before, the beams \u201care highly divergent\u201d, says study co-author Shusei Kamioka, a particle physicist at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Tsukuba, Japan. As a result, the beams are too unruly to be used for sensitive measurements.",
            "To overcome this roadblock, Kamioka and his colleagues shot a beam of positively-charged muons \u2014 the antimatter counterpart of muons, called antimuons \u2014 into silica aerogel, a sponge-like material that\u2019s often used as a thermal insulator. When the antimuons hit electrons in the aerogel, neutral atoms of \u2018muonium\u2019 formed. The researchers fired a laser at these atoms to strip away their electrons, turning them back into antimuons that were almost frozen in place. This cooling process made the particles\u2019 speeds and directions uniform.",
            "Next, the researchers used an electric field to accelerate these slowed-down muons to an energy of 100 kiloelectronvolts, achieving a speed of around 4% that of light.",
            "Although the results are promising, there\u2019s still a long way to go before muon colliders will become a reality, says Holmes. The approach would need to be scaled up to produce even tighter, higher-intensity beams, she says.",
            "Kamioka said he and his colleagues are developing the technology needed to accelerate muons to 94% of the speed of light, and hope to achieve this by 2028. \u201cThat is our next milestone,\u201d he says.",
            "Besides building a future collider, physicists could use high-energy muon beams in experiments that could go beyond the standard model of particle physics, such as precisely measuring the muon\u2019s mysterious magnetism \u2014 which has been shown to be stronger than predicted by theory, says Kamioka.",

This marks the first time that people with Marburg virus disease have been extubated in Africa, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, said at a briefing on 20 October. \u201cThese patients would have died in previous outbreaks,\u201d he said.",

They also found that the virus strain is closely related to one detected in Uganda in 2014 and to one found in bats in 2009, Yvan Butera, Rwanda\u2019s minister of state for health, who co-led the research, tells Nature.",

Generally, viruses collect mutations as they replicate over time; if it is true that the mutation rate is low, Rasmussen wonders how the virus lingers in its animal reservoir \u2014 the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) \u2014 without major changes.",
