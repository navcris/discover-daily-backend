            "Scientists in Boston, Massachusetts have made reprogrammed stem cells from the blood of centenarians. They plan to share the cells with other researchers to better understand the factors that contribute to a long and healthy life. Early experiments are already providing insights on brain ageing.",
            "Centenarians offer an opportunity to study longevity. People who\u2019ve lived to 100 have an amazing ability to bounce back from insult and injury, says George Murphy, a stem-cell biologist at the Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. One centenarian he knows recovered from the 1912 Spanish flu and COVID-19, twice. One theory that explains centenarians\u2019 robust age is that they possess a genetic makeup that protects them from diseases. ",
            "But testing that idea is a challenge. People of that age are rare, which makes blood and skin samples from them a precious resource for research. That gave Murphy and his colleagues the idea to create a bank of centenarian cells that could be shared among scientists.",
            "\u201cThis bank is really exciting,\u201d says Chiara Herzog, who studies epigenetics and ageing at Kings College London.",
            "\u201cIt will be a very useful resource for the field,\u201d says Vadim Gladyshev, an ageing researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston.",
            "h2Finding centenarians",
            "Murphy collaborated with Tom Perls, a physician specializing in geriatrics, also at the Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, who runs the largest study of people 100 years and older, the New England Centenarian Study. They searched for centenarians in US voter-registration lists, news articles and long-term-care facilities. Many were happy to participate \u201cbecause they know how special they are\u201d, says Perls.",
            "Participants were assessed for their cognitive and physical abilities, and had samples of their blood collected. Many were cognitively healthy and cared for themselves.",
            "For about 30 centenarians, the researchers isolated blood cells and reverted them to a pluripotent state, from which they could be turned into any cell type in the body. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells lose many aspects of their \u2018age\u2019 through the reversion process without altering their genetic code. This allows researchers to use the cells to study the genetic determinants of ageing, says Herzog.",

            "Faeces and vomit fossils from dinosaurs reveal how the animals evolved to rule Earth. The study, which was published in Nature on 27 November, analysed hundreds of pieces of fossilized digestive material, called bromalites, to reconstruct what dinosaurs ate and how this changed1. The fossils reveal that the rise of the dinosaurs, over millions of years during the Triassic period, was influenced by factors including climate change and other species\u2019 extinction.",
            "\u201cOur study shows that you can use pretty seemingly unremarkable fossils to get pretty remarkable results,\u201d says co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m, who studies early dinosaur evolution at Uppsala University in Sweden.",
            "Palaeontologists have come up with differing theories for how dinosaurs became the dominant species on Earth. Dinosaurs might have overtaken their rivals because they were particularly able to adapt to a changing ecosystem, for instance, or because random environmental changes favoured them over other species. But there isn\u2019t a single hypothesis that fully explains their rise to dominance.",

            "h2What dinosaurs ate",
            "To better understand dinosaurs\u2019 early evolution, Qvarnstr\u00f6m and his colleagues cut open and examined more than 500 bromalites from the Polish Basin in Central Europe. The fossils are estimated to be around 200 million years old. ",
            "The team used several methods to analyse the bromalites and their contents, including different types of microscope and a technique known as synchrotron microtomography, which uses a particle accelerator to see inside the fossils in detail. The researchers also used chemical solutions to inspect the exact contents of the remains, which included fish, plants and insects.",
            "Despite the age and acidity of many of the fossils, the team found many of the insects the dinosaurs ate to be well preserved. \u201cSome of them were so beautifully preserved in three dimensions and with all the antennae and legs,\u201d says Qvarnstr\u00f6m.",
            "Analysis of the digestive materials allowed the researchers to \u201creconstruct these food webs, so who was eating whom in all these assemblages and see this trend over such a long period of time\u201d, Qvarnstr\u00f6m says.",
            "h2Adapt or die",
            "The team found that the number and variety of the contents of the fossils increased over time, suggesting that larger dinosaurs with more diverse feeding habits began to gain prominence in the late Triassic period (between 237 million and 201 million years ago). By comparing the fossils with plant data from the period, the researchers found that dinosaurs\u2019 rise was shaped by chance and by adaptations. For example, climate change led to increased humidity, which changed the vegetation available. Dinosaurs were able to better adapt to this shifting climate and change in diet than were other land animals.",

            "Can the world finally agree on how to end plastic pollution? We should know by the end of the week.",
            "Negotiators from 175 countries are in Busan, South Korea, to thrash out what many hope will be a legally binding United Nations treaty to drastically cut plastic pollution. Researchers are hopeful a strong treaty will emerge from the fifth \u2014 and final \u2014 session of the negotiations, but there is a high chance that any agreement will be weak or delayed. Until a global consensus is reached, however, many cities and nations are introducing their own policies.",
            "\u201cSome countries are pre-emptively protecting themselves, regardless of what happens with the treaty,\u201d says Trisia Farrelly, an environmental anthropologist at New Zealand\u2019s Cawthron Institute in Nelson and a co-lead of the Scientists\u2019 Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, an independent group attending the meeting as an observer. ",
            "These policies showcase what can work, researchers say, but also highlight why a global effort is important. Some groups, including the scientists\u2019 coalition, support a treaty that will reduce production of non-essential plastics, which have skyrocketed to unsustainable levels. But some nations, particularly those that make petrochemicals, want the treaty to focus on waste management instead, including steps such as recycling.",
            " \u201cIf we miss this opportunity to do unified policy-making with standardized guidelines, we\u2019re going to set ourselves back decades or more,\u201d says Douglas McCauley at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who published modelling work on plastics policies earlier this month1.",
            "h2Ban single-use plastics",
            "More than 90 nations and territories have passed full or partial bans on single-use plastic products such as carrier bags. These bans can be very effective. One analysis showed that bans in five US states and cities together cut consumption of single-use plastic bags by about six billion bags per year2. Several studies have also shown huge reductions in plastic litter in waterways, says McCauley. Even fees can work. A litter survey in the United Kingdom found that the number of plastic bags found on beaches dropped by 80% after the nation introduced a mandatory fee for single-use carrier bags, although other forms of litter had increased.",
            "But bans that are poorly designed or enforced are likely to be ineffective. California, for example, allowed shops to switch to thicker, reusable carrier bags \u2014 but people still threw them away, leading to a higher rate of plastic disposal than before. Policies need to be monitored and reviewed, says McCauley. \u201cYou have to put a policy in place, take data and then whack-a-mole the loopholes.\u201d",
            "h2Make the producer pay",
            "Many nations and US states require companies that produce plastic packaging to pay for it to be recycled, which can boost recycling rates. In Spain,for example, the government introduced an \u2018extended producer responsibilities\u2019 policy, and the recycling of paper and plastics rose from 5% up to 81%.",
            "Such policies are also meant to incentivize companies to redesign their packaging, but because most of the fees are based on weight, they mainly influence the amount of packaging used rather than its composition. A good idea, says Richard Thompson, a marine scientist at the University of Plymouth, UK, and a co-lead of the scientists\u2019 coalition, is to have a policy that rewards or mandates inclusion of recycled content in products: in the United Kingdom, for example, plastic producers pay a tax of \u00a3217.85 (US$274) per tonne of plastic, but only for packaging that\u2019s less than 30% recycled. Such incentives \u201cwill pull demand in the right way\u201d, says Thompson.",
            "As with all policies, there are some good, some bad, says Farrelly. She has seen policies that end up increasing the use of recycling centres in the Pacific islands that don\u2019t have high safety standards for their workers, for example.",
            "h2Cut down microplastics use",
            "One of the most pernicious forms of plastic pollution is microplastics: tiny chunks that are, for example, abraded off car tyres, washed out of textiles or released from products such as cosmetics. Microplastics are thought to make up 15\u201331% of the estimated 9.5 million tonnes of plastic released into the oceans each year. More than a dozen countries have banned microbeads from cosmetics, which has put significant pressure on companies to stop using them, says Thompson.",
            "France has become first country to mandate that new washing machines have a microfibre filter, a policy that\u2019s due to come into effect in January next year. Thompson\u2019s group tested six such filters and found that some can be reasonably effective3; one reduced the amount of microfibre content in the wastewater by more than 75%. ",
            "Filters aren\u2019t a panacea for microplastics in clothes, says Thompson, because about half of a garment\u2019s fibres are shed during wear. A shift in how textiles are made would be more effective, he says, but this has proven a hard task for national legislation to tackle. \u201cThis is a classic example of why we need an international treaty,\u201d says Thompson.",

He went outside and saw a live duck mounting the dead one that had just hit the window. It was the first documented case of homosexual necrophilia in ducks, says Moeliker, who reported his findings six years later2. He expected that only a handful of people would read the paper, but then he received a phone call in 2003 offering him an Ig Nobel Prize.",

He shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for the discovery of graphene, but the Ig Nobel came a decade earlier for a very different kind of work: using a magnet to levitate a frog. One Friday night at Radboud University in the Netherlands, Geim poured water into a powerful 16-tesla magnet and found that it levitated. The floating drop shocked his colleagues because it seemed to violate ideas about magnetism.",

So he reached out to Michael Berry, a theoretical physicist at the University of Bristol, UK, and Geim\u2019s co-author on a paper describing the levitating frog3. As a tenured academic, Berry provided the cover of being associated with a highly respected scientist.",
            "Geim talks often about his frog experiment and the value of the curiosity-led science that led to his Ig Nobel Prize. It was on another Friday night, several years after the levitation experiments, that Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who is now at the National University of Singapore, stuck a piece of tape to graphite, leading to their discovery of graphene4 \u2014 and their shared Nobel prize.",
            "Geim and Maguire aren\u2019t the only Ig Nobel winners who had qualms about accepting the prize. And Abrahams has built in allowances for that. He and his colleagues contact potential recipients confidentially months before the prize-giving ceremony and offer them the chance to accept or reject the award. Abrahams also arranges for them to be handed out by Nobel prize-winners at the annual ceremony. \u201cTo have these credible people be a part of it makes it much harder for anyone to jump to the conclusion that we are out to do damage,\u201d he says.",

Whereas the binary digits (bits) of classical computers encode either a 1 or a 0, qubits can be put into a \u2018superposition\u2019 \u2014 existing in two states at once, a combination of both 1 and 0, with a chance of being measured as either. Calculations come from \u2018entangling\u2019 these qubits, meaning that their quantum states become intrinsically linked and interdependent. To prevent errors from destroying the calculations, a quantum computer will need around 10,000 physical qubits working together to make each useful \u2018logical\u2019 qubit, O\u2019Brien says. With a few hundred of these, researchers hope that quantum computers will be able to perform complex calculations, such as modelling chemical processes at the quantum level, that would be much too difficult for a classical machine.",
            "Many firms in the field make their qubits from atoms, ions or tiny rings of a superconducting material \u2014 in each case, a physical object that has some mass and is often fixed in place. But PsiQuantum is one of a handful of companies that uses massless particles of light, or photons \u2014 sometimes known as flying qubits.",
            "The idea to use light as a qubit isn\u2019t new. In the early 2000s, optical quantum computing was one of the first platforms to be explored experimentally. Some of PsiQuantum\u2019s founders were involved in the field\u2019s birth, says Senellart, who is a co-founder of Quandela, a firm based near Paris that makes photonic quantum computers.",
            "Making a quantum computer with light is \u201con paper, quite easy\u201d, she says. PsiQuantum creates qubits by using an optical device called a beam splitter to send a single photon simultaneously down two routes (known as waveguides) etched into silicon. Because photons have no charge or mass, they are largely unaffected by their surroundings. This means that, even at room temperature, photon-based qubits are insensitive to many types of noise that plague rival hardware. This ability to maintain quantum information and travel long distances at speed makes it easy to build big and fast systems. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge asset,\u201d says Senellart.",
            "IBM releases first-ever 1,000-qubit quantum chip",
            "But photons also come with hurdles. It is hard to generate single, near-identical photons on demand. They are readily absorbed and lost. And getting the flighty particles to interact is a challenge. Although light waves do interfere with each other, that kind of interaction alone is not sufficient for constructing multi-qubit gates, in which qubits entangle to form basic logic operations.",
            "To generate photons, the firm pumps laser light through silicon. These sources are probabilistic: they produce pairs of photons perhaps once in every 20 attempts. Having a pair is necessary because the spare, or \u2018herald\u2019, photon provides a heads-up that allows the computer to use the surviving photon.",
            "With this strategy, each chip needs many such sources, as well as super-efficient waveguides and optical components that can handle photons without losing them.",
            "To perform logic operations, PsiQuantum first builds up clusters of entangled photon qubits by bringing photons together so that their light waves interfere, then making measurements on some of them in ways that entangle the remaining qubits. Calculations then occur by performing a succession of such measurements on pairs of photons from different clusters. Those measurements destroy the pairs but entangle their clusters, a technique known as fusion-based quantum computing (see \u2018Quantum computers with \u2018flying qubits\u2019\u2019). Senellart says that PsiQuantum has an impressive team working on developing the theory behind such a computer. \u201cThey are coming up with a lot of smart schemes,\u201d she says.",

            "PsiQuantum\u2019s approach continually generates and destroys photons, with each qubit needing to exist only for long enough to be entangled or measured with another, not for the duration of the calculation. And although each operation involves an element of chance and photons will get lost, failures are detectable as part of the measurement, says Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia, a physicist at PsiQuantum who is working on the computer\u2019s architecture.",

            "Archaeologists found the cylinders in one of ten tombs in Umm el-Marra. The burial areas also contained gold jewellery, silver vessels, an ivory comb and pottery. \u201cJudging from their contents, these tombs belonged to people of the highest social rank,\u201d Schwartz said at the meeting.",
            "The cylinders are each one centimetre thick and 4.7 centimetres long, pierced with a small lengthwise hole. In 2021, using radiocarbon dating, Schwartz and his team determined1 that the tubes originate from around 2400 bc. \u201cIt\u2019s 500 years earlier than any other early alphabetic inscription we have. So that\u2019s surprising,\u201d says Dobbs-Allsopp.",
            "Before their discovery, a script from 1900 bc in Egypt was the oldest known alphabetic writing; it turned hieroglyphs into alphabetic letters of West Semitic languages. Hieroglyphs are not considered an alphabet because they mainly use pictures to represent entire words, rather than consisting of a set of letters that each correspond to a sound.",
            "The symbols appear 11 times in total on the cylinders and some are repeated \u2014 evidence that they might be part of an alphabet. Two of the four cylinders seem to have the same sequence, finishing with the same symbol at their unbroken ends. The longer the sequence of symbols, the more likely it is to represent writing rather than comprising non-linguistic symbols, said Schwartz.",
            "Semitic-languages specialist Theodore Lewis at Johns Hopkins, who worked with Schwartz, suggests that one sequence, which can be translated to \u2018sl\u2019nw\u2019, might be the name Sillunu found in texts from the site of Ugarit, an ancient city on the Syrian coast, and derived from a word that means rock.",
