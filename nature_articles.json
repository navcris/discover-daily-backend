            "When Sam Rodriques was a neurobiology graduate student, he was struck by a fundamental limitation of science. Even if researchers had already produced all the information needed to understand a human cell or a brain, \u201cI\u2019m not sure we would know it\u201d, he says, \u201cbecause no human has the ability to understand or read all the literature and get a comprehensive view.\u201d",
            "Five years later, Rodriques says he is closer to solving that problem using artificial intelligence (AI). In September, he and his team at the US start-up FutureHouse announced that an AI-based system they had built could, within minutes, produce syntheses of scientific knowledge that were more accurate than Wikipedia pages1. The team promptly generated Wikipedia-style entries on around 17,000 human genes, most of which previously lacked a detailed page.",
            "How AI-powered science search engines can speed up your research",
            "Rodriques is not the only one turning to AI to help synthesize science. For decades, scholars have been trying to accelerate the onerous task of compiling bodies of research into reviews. \u201cThey\u2019re too long, they\u2019re incredibly intensive and they\u2019re often out of date by the time they\u2019re written,\u201d says Iain Marshall, who studies research synthesis at King\u2019s College London. The explosion of interest in large language models (LLMs), the generative-AI programs that underlie tools such as ChatGPT, is prompting fresh excitement about automating the task.",
            "Some of the newer AI-powered science search engines can already help people to produce narrative literature reviews \u2014 a written tour of studies \u2014 by finding, sorting and summarizing publications. But they can\u2019t yet produce a high-quality review by themselves. The toughest challenge of all is the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 systematic review, which involves stringent procedures to search and assess papers, and often a meta-analysis to synthesize the results. Most researchers agree that these are a long way from being fully automated. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll eventually get there,\u201d says Paul Glasziou, a specialist in evidence and systematic reviews at Bond University in Gold Coast, Australia. \u201cI just can\u2019t tell you whether that\u2019s 10 years away or 100 years away.\u201d",
            "At the same time, however, researchers fear that AI tools could lead to more sloppy, inaccurate or misleading reviews polluting the literature. \u201cThe worry is that all the decades of research on how to do good evidence synthesis starts to be undermined,\u201d says James Thomas, who studies evidence synthesis at University College London.",
            "h2Computer-assisted reviews",
            "Computer software has been helping researchers to search and parse the research literature for decades. Well before LLMs emerged, scientists were using machine-learning and other algorithms to help to identify particular studies or to quickly pull findings out of papers. But the advent of systems such as ChatGPT has triggered a frenzy of interest in speeding up this process by combining LLMs with other software.",
            "AI science search engines are exploding in number \u2014 are they any good? ",
            "It would be terribly naive to ask ChatGPT \u2014 or any other AI chatbot \u2014 to simply write an academic literature review from scratch, researchers say. These LLMs generate text by training on enormous amounts of writing, but most commercial AI firms do not reveal what data the models were trained on. If asked to review research on a topic, an LLM such as ChatGPT is likely to draw on credible academic research, inaccurate blogs and who knows what other information, says Marshall. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no weighing up of what the most pertinent, high-quality literature is,\u201d he says. And because LLMs work by repeatedly generating statistically plausible words in response to a query, they produce different answers to the same question and \u2018hallucinate\u2019 errors \u2014 including, notoriously, non-existent academic references. \u201cNone of the processes which are regarded as good practice in research synthesis take place,\u201d Marshall says.",
            "A more sophisticated process involves uploading a corpus of pre-selected papers to an LLM, and asking it to extract insights from them, basing its answer only on those studies. This \u2018retrieval-augmented generation\u2019 seems to cut down on hallucinations, although it does not prevent them. The process can also be set up so that the LLM will reference the sources it drew its information from.",
            "This is the basis for specialized, AI-powered science search engines such as Consensus and Elicit. Most companies do not reveal exact details of how their systems work. But they typically turn a user\u2019s question into a computerized search across academic databases such as Semantic Scholar and PubMed, returning the most relevant results.",
            "An LLM then summarizes each of these studies and synthesizes them into an answer that cites its sources; the user is given various options to filter the work they want to include. \u201cThey are search engines first and foremost,\u201d says Aaron Tay, who heads data services at Singapore Management University and blogs about AI tools. \u201cAt the very least, what they cite is definitely real.\u201d",
            "These tools \u201ccan certainly make your review and writing processes efficient\u201d, says Mushtaq Bilal, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, who trains academics in AI tools and has designed his own, called Research Kick. Another AI system called Scite, for example, can quickly generate a detailed breakdown of papers that support or refute a claim. Elicit and other systems can also extract insights from different sections of papers \u2014 the methods, conclusions and so on. There\u2019s \u201ca huge amount of labour that you can outsource\u201d, Bilal says.",
            "*Laptop_screen_with_an_AI-powered_tool_called_Elicit_with_papers'_summary",
            "Elicit, like several AI-powered tools, aims to help with academic literature reviews by summarising papers and extracting data.Credit: Nature",
            "But most AI science search engines cannot produce an accurate literature review autonomously, Bilal says. Their output is more \u201cat the level of an undergraduate student who pulls an all-nighter and comes up with the main points of a few papers\u201d. It is better for researchers to use the tools to optimize parts of the review process, he says. James Brady, head of engineering at Elicit, says that its users are augmenting steps of reviewing \u201cto great effect\u201d.",
            "Another limitation of some tools, including Elicit, is that they can only search open-access papers and abstracts, rather than the full text of articles. (Elicit, in Oakland, California, searches about 125 million papers; Consensus, in Boston, Massachusetts, looks at more than 200 million.) Bilal notes that much of the research literature is paywalled and it\u2019s computationally intensive to search a lot of full text. \u201cRunning an AI app through the whole text of millions of articles will take a lot of time, and it will become prohibitively expensive,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Full-text search",
            "For Rodriques, money was in plentiful supply, because FutureHouse, a non-profit organization in San Francisco, California, is backed by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt and other funders. Founded in 2023, FutureHouse aims to automate research tasks using AI.",
            "Could AI help you to write your next paper?",
            "This September, Rodriques and his team revealed PaperQA2, FutureHouse\u2019s open-source, prototype AI system1. When it is given a query, PaperQA2 searches several academic databases for relevant papers and tries to access the full text of both open-access and paywalled content. (Rodriques says the team has access to many paywalled papers through its members\u2019 academic affiliations.) The system then identifies and summarizes the most relevant elements. In part because PaperQA2 digests the full text of papers, running it is expensive, he says.",
            "The FutureHouse team tested the system by using it to generate Wikipedia-style articles on individual human genes. They then gave several hundred AI-written statements from these articles, along with statements from real (human-written) Wikipedia articles on the same topic, to a blinded panel of PhD and postdoctoral biologists. The panel found that human-authored articles contained twice as many \u2018reasoning errors\u2019 \u2014 in which a written claim is not properly supported by the citation \u2014 than did ones written by the AI tool. Because the tool outperforms people in this way, the team titled its paper \u2018Language agents achieve superhuman synthesis of scientific knowledge\u2019.",

            "Tay says that PaperQA2 and another tool called Undermind take longer than conventional search engines to return results \u2014 minutes rather than seconds \u2014 because they conduct more-sophisticated searches, using the results of the initial search to track down other citations and key phrases, for example. \u201cThat all adds up to being very computationally expensive and slow, but gives a substantially higher quality search,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Systematic challenge",
            "Narrative summaries of the literature are hard enough to produce, but systematic reviews are even worse. They can take people many months or even years to complete2.",
            "A systematic review involves at least 25 careful steps, according to a breakdown from Glasziou\u2019s team. After combing through the literature, a researcher must filter their longlist to find the most pertinent papers, then extract data, screen studies for potential bias and synthesize the results. (Many of these steps are done in duplicate by another researcher to check for inconsistencies.) This laborious method \u2014 which is supposed to be rigorous, transparent and reproducible \u2014 is considered worthwhile in medicine, for instance, because clinicians use the results to guide important decisions about treating patients.",
            " ChatGPT-like AIs are coming to major science search engines",
            "In 2019, before ChatGPT came along, Glasziou and his colleagues set out to achieve a world record in science: a systematic review in two weeks. He and others, including Marshall and Thomas, had already developed computer tools to reduce the time involved. The menu of software available by that time included RobotSearch, a machine-learning model trained to quickly identify randomized trials from a collection of studies. RobotReviewer, another AI system, helps to assess whether a study is at risk of bias because it was not adequately blinded, for instance. \u201cAll of those are important little tools in shaving down the time of doing a systematic review,\u201d Glasziou says.",
            "The clock started at 9:30 a.m. on Monday 21 January 2019. The team cruised across the line at lunchtime on Friday 1 February, after a total of nine working days3. \u201cI was excited,\u201d says epidemiologist Anna Mae Scott at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the study while at Bond University; everyone celebrated with cake. Since then, the team has pared its record down to five days.",
            "Could the process get faster? Other researchers have been working to automate aspects of systematic reviews, too. In 2015, Glasziou founded the International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews, a niche community that, fittingly, has produced several systematic reviews about tools for automating systematic reviews4. But even so, \u201cnot very many [tools] have seen widespread acceptance\u201d, says Marshall. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of how mature the technology is.\u201d",
            "Elicit is one company that says its tool helps researchers with systematic reviews, not just narrative ones. The firm does not offer systematic reviews at the push of a button, says Brady, but its system does automate some of the steps \u2014 including screening papers and extracting data and insights. Brady says that most researchers who use it for systematic reviews have uploaded relevant papers they find using other search techniques.",
            "Systematic-review aficionados worry that AI tools are at risk of failing to meet two essential criteria of the studies: transparency and reproducibility. \u201cIf I can\u2019t see the methods used, then it is not a systematic review, it is simply a review article,\u201d says Justin Clark, who builds review automation tools as part of Glasziou\u2019s team. Brady says that the papers that reviewers upload to Elicit \u201care an excellent, transparent record\u201d of their starting literature. As for reproducibility: \u201cWe don\u2019t guarantee that our results are always going to be identical across repeats of the same steps, but we aim to make it so \u2014 within reason,\u201d he says, adding that transparency and reproducibility will be important as the firm improves its system.",
            "Specialists in reviewing say they would like to see more published evaluations of the accuracy and reproducibility of AI systems that have been designed to help produce literature reviews. \u201cBuilding cool tools and trying stuff out is really good fun,\u201d says Clark. \u201cDoing a hardcore evaluative study is a lot of hard work.\u201d",
            "Audit AI search tools now, before they skew research",
            "Earlier this year, Clark led a systematic review of studies that had used generative AI tools to help with systematic reviewing. He and his team found only 15 published studies in which the AI\u2019s performance had been adequately compared with that of a person. The results, which have not yet been published or peer reviewed, suggest that these AI systems can extract some data from uploaded studies and assess the risk of bias of clinical trials. \u201cIt seems to do OK with reading and assessing papers,\u201d Clark says, \u201cbut it did very badly at all these other tasks\u201d, including designing and conducting a thorough literature search. (Existing computer software can already do the final step of synthesizing data using a meta-analysis.)",
            "Glasziou and his team are still trying to shave time off their reviewing record through improved tools, which are available on a website they call the Evidence Review Accelerator. \u201cIt won\u2019t be one big thing. It\u2019s that every year you\u2019ll get faster and faster,\u201d Glasziou predicts. In 2022, for instance, the group released a computerized tool called Methods Wizard, which asks users a series of questions about their methods and then writes a protocol for them without using AI.",
            "h2Rushed reviews?",
            "Automating the synthesis of information also comes with risks. Researchers have known for years that many systematic reviews are redundant or of poor quality5, and AI could make these problems worse. Authors might knowingly or unknowingly use AI tools to race through a review that does not follow rigorous procedures, or which includes poor-quality work, and get a misleading result.",
            "By contrast, says Glasziou, AI could also encourage researchers to do a quick check of previously published literature when they wouldn\u2019t have bothered before. \u201cAI may raise their game,\u201d he says. And Brady says that, in future, AI tools could help to flag and filter out poor-quality papers by looking for telltale signs such as P-hacking, a form of data manipulation.",
            "Glasziou sees the situation as a balance of two forces: AI tools could help scientists to produce high-quality reviews, but might also fuel the rapid generation of substandard ones. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the net impact is going to be on the published literature,\u201d he says.",
            "Some people argue that the ability to synthesize and make sense of the world\u2019s knowledge should not lie solely in the hands of opaque, profit-making companies. Clark wants to see non-profit groups build and carefully test AI tools. He and other researchers welcomed the announcement from two UK funders last month that they are investing more than US$70 million in evidence-synthesis systems. \u201cWe just want to be cautious and careful,\u201d Clark says. \u201cWe want to make sure that the answers that [technology] is helping to provide to us are correct.\u201d",

He felt a tingling, poking sensation in his hand, like \u201creaching into an evergreen bush\u201d, he says. \u201cIt was like I was decorating a Christmas tree.\u201d",
            "Back in 1985, a car crash shattered three of Imbrie\u2019s vertebrae and severed 70% of his spinal cord, leaving him with very limited sensation or mobility in parts of his body. Now, thanks to an implanted brain\u2013computer interface (BCI), Imbrie can operate a robotic arm, and receive sensory information related to what that arm is doing. Imbrie spends four days a week, three hours at a time, testing, refining and tuning the device with a team of researchers at the University of Chicago in Illinois.",
            "Scientists have been trying to restore mobility for people with missing or paralysed limbs for decades. The aim, historically, was to give people the ability to control prosthetics with commands from the nervous system. But this motor-first approach produced bionic limbs that were much less helpful than hoped: devices were cumbersome and provided only rudimentary control of a hand or leg. What\u2019s more, they just didn\u2019t feel like they were part of the body and required too much concentration to use.",
            "The brain-reading devices helping paralysed people to move, talk and touch",
            "Scientists gradually began to realize that restoring full mobility meant restoring the ability to sense touch and temperature, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Gaunt says that this realization has led to a revolution in the field.",
            "A landmark study1 came in 2016, when a team led by Gaunt restored tactile sensations in a person with upper-limb paralysis using a computer chip implanted in a region of the brain that controls the hand. Gaunt then teamed up with his Pittsburgh colleague, bioengineer Jennifer Collinger, to integrate a robotic arm with the BCI, allowing the individual to feel and manipulate objects2. \u201cIt meant they could perform motor tasks much faster,\u201d says Collinger. Around the same time, studies in people with limbs that have been amputated showed how restoring tactile inputs into peripheral nerves also drastically improved control of prosthetic hands3.",
            "But researchers haven\u2019t fully cracked the code on how to interpret or create natural sensations that truly benefit people\u2019s lives. Somatosensation \u2014 the collection of senses that interpret touch, temperature, pain and body position \u2014 is dauntingly complex. Imagine trying to encode information that could discern a soft kiss from a painful pinch, or the needles of a pine tree from the bristles of a paintbrush. To create safe and stable interfaces with the brain and body, researchers need to make major advances in engineering as well as in understanding the sensorimotor system, says Rochelle Ackerley, a neuroscientist at Aix-Marseille University in France. And as developers look to increase the size of implanted-device trials, stakeholders have yet to solve ethical issues around the risks of BCIs and high-tech prosthetic devices.",

            "One of the first challenges is the plethora of information that needs to be encoded. \u201cWhen we touch an object, different sensory neurons in our skin code its shape, pressure and texture,\u201d says Giacomo Valle, a neuroengineer at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. Valle has been attempting to mimic these neural codes, then deliver them to the brain, either through the body\u2019s sensory nerves or directly to the cortex.",

            "Valle worked with Imbrie during his postdoc in the laboratory of Sliman Bensmaia who was at the University of Chicago, drawing knowledge from decades of animal research about how to create different types of tactile sensation. He learnt that tweaking the parameters of electrical impulses creates very specific sensations of textures, pressures and stroking directions. When constructed together, these impulses form sensations of objects. Valle and his colleagues\u2019 latest study4 shows just how far this approach has come. Through the electrodes in Imbrie\u2019s brain, physicians were able to create the sensation of touching the edge of a shape or feeling the motion of an object dragged across Imbrie\u2019s fingertips. Imbrie remembers the vivid feeling when Valle drew certain letters on the interface for Imbrie to interpret. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh my, Giacomo, you just drew an O on my fingertip\u2019, and I could see the grin coming from his face,\u201d says Imbrie.",
            "The principle is exactly the same in people who have had an amputation, but technically more straightforward because tactile signals can be routed into residual nerves in the part of a person\u2019s limb that remains. This technique is allowing individuals to better manipulate and detect objects with bionic hands, or have better balance and gait with bionic legs.",

Shokur thinks that restoring multisensory inputs will return all the warmth and feeling that somatosensation gives us. \u201cTouch without temperature is like vision without colour,\u201d he says.",
            "Shokur has created warm and cool sensations in the \u2018phantom\u2019 hands of people with an upper-limb amputation by stimulating nerves in their remaining limb with a thermal device5.

Herr says that the priority should be restoring those sensory inputs that most improve mobility and function. Above all, he says, it\u2019s important to have prosthetic limbs that feel to users like they\u2019re part of their body, and not just bionic, artificial attachments \u2014 a sensation known as embodiment. \u201cWhen amputees experience natural sensations from their prosthesis as if it was their own limb, and when people can think and move their prosthesis with little error, it gives them a sense of ownership and agency,\u201d says Herr.",

Designers are merging multiple tissues of the body \u2014 muscle, tendon, bone and nerves \u2014 with synthetic technologies to drive human\u2013machine integration to the next level. Herr\u2019s research team is focusing on surgical techniques and implants that improve on the electrodes used in current bionic-limb systems, which either penetrate the peripheral nerves or wrap around them. \u201cWe\u2019re reimagining how limbs should be amputated and bionic limbs constructed,\u201d he says.",

            "Herr\u2019s group, along with collaborators such as Matthew Carty at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, have developed a method of restoring sensory inputs by regrowing nerves in the residual part of an amputated leg, sometimes referred to as the stump. The idea is to make the stump sense when a prosthetic limb hits the ground while walking, but have the sensation felt in the phantom foot rather than in the stump. The approach involved taking parts of the person\u2019s heel skin and surgically attaching them to intact sensory nerves in the stump. The skin graft is connected to a muscle\u2013computer interface, which contracts the muscle to mechanically activate the sensory nerve. \u201cWhen that muscle fires and applies a strain on the skin, the person feels heel strike,\u201d says Herr. Initially developed in rats, the method is now being tested in a clinical trial. It\u2019s early days, but unpublished data suggest that people can feel toe movements and heel pressures. Herr is now testing how this affects bionic-limb embodiment and motor capabilities.",
            "In a publication in July6, Herr and his colleagues demonstrated a similar approach that aims to reproduce the sense of limb positioning, known as proprioception. It had \u201cremarkable\u201d results on bionic legs, restoring almost all mobility, he says. \u201cIf we restored just 18% of total proprioception into the nerve, patients could run up and down steps without a handrail,\u201d says Herr. However, the BCI didn\u2019t restore naturalistic sensations \u2014 individuals didn\u2019t consciously feel the proprioceptive inputs.",
            "How a revolutionary technique got people with spinal-cord injuries back on their feet",
            "Gaunt says that Herr\u2019s system is an impressive demonstration of how restoring proprioception can improve overall function of prosthetic limbs. The benefit, he says, is that the improvement comes through surgery combined with non-invasive neural prosthetics, but he questions how scalable the approach is.",
            "Studies are also showing a somewhat unexpected outcome of creating more embodied prosthetic limbs \u2014 alleviating phantom-limb pain3. This pain, which feels like it comes from the part of the limb that is missing, is a major issue for many people with amputated limbs. \u201cPeripheral-nerve stimulation can decrease phantom-limb pain by recovering lost or erroneous signals at the site,\u201d Ackerley says. It\u2019s becoming clearer, she adds, that bionic devices that stimulate peripheral nerves can also improve affective and social touch, increase comfort and reconnection with a missing limb and prevent \u2018telescoping\u2019, which is the feeling of a phantom limb \u2018shrinking\u2019 into the stump. \u201cEmbodiment and pain are major issues that bionic devices can tackle, providing ways to make prosthetic limbs useful on a more psychological level,\u201d Ackerley says.",
            "h2E-skins",
            "Integrating sensory inputs into a prosthetic limb, either through BCIs or by connecting with peripheral nerves, goes a long way towards replacing a lost arm or leg, but creating a realistic limb, complete with simulated skin, is what many consider the ideal. Zhenan Bao, an engineer at Stanford University in California, talks of the mark that science-fiction films, such as those in the Star Wars franchise, have left on the field. Luke Skywalker\u2019s bionic hand in Return of the Jedi (1983) still serves as the \u201cmoonshot idea\u201d of a bionic limb gloved in synthetic skin, she says. Electronic skins, or e-skins, pull together advances in neuroscience and engineering and could open up the capabilities of prostheses. Although first developed in the 1970s, the field entered a new phase with e-skins when Bao showcased7 a high-tech example in 2023.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re starting to create artificial materials that look and feel like skin. They\u2019re capable not only of sensing information from the environment but can also generate signals to directly communicate with the nervous system to create natural sensations,\u201d says Bao.",
            "The brain-reading devices helping paralysed people to move, talk and touch",
            "A handful of labs are working on improving the capabilities of various integral components of e-skin, including environmental sensors, microcircuits that convert the sensory signals into digital outputs and electrical interfaces to connect the sensors with peripheral nerves. Nitish Thakor, a neuroengineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who works on e-skins, says that progress has only been possible because of breakthroughs in two major domains. First, in nanomaterials and electronics, through \u201cmaking flexible and organic transistors that act like a touch receptor in the skin\u201d, and can self-heal when damaged8. Second, in neuroscience, by converting sensory information into digital data \u201cas spikes that can be used to stimulate the nervous system\u201d, he says.",
            "Bao is most excited about the idea of using e-skins to \u201cgo beyond human capabilities\u201d. One of the studies she was involved in showed an e-skin that is so tightly packed with mechanical sensors that it can read entire words in Braille, instead of one letter at a time9. \u201cYou can also imagine other sensors allowing us to know things like the chemical contents of objects,\u201d says Bao.",
            "Thakor highlights one glaring issue with e-skins, however: none has yet been trialled in humans or integrated into prosthetics. Bao says that she aims to test commercially produced e-skins in people fitted with prostheses in the next two years.",
            "h2Challenges ahead",
            "Although developments in BCIs, neuroprostheses and e-skins have been remarkable, the field is a long way from using them to improve people\u2019s daily lives. Individuals who benefit from these technologies only do so as part of clinical trials, often with intensive, expensive in-lab testing schedules. It\u2019s not yet clear how or when they could take their devices home without the need of scientists \u201ctwiddling knobs\u201d, says Gaunt.",
            "A major problem that researchers are trying to solve is neural interfacing. Currently, scientists can create precisely localized sensations only by stimulating the somatosensory cortex, not through peripheral nerves. But they are testing a number of techniques, such as optogenetics \u2014 a way to control the activity of specific sets of neurons with light, and high-resolution electrodes to selectively stimulate individual nerve fibres. Bao, for one, is working on these approaches, but says that they\u2019re still early in development.",
            "Abandoned: the human cost of neurotechnology failure",
            "Outside the lab, the most pressing issues for individuals relates to ethical and access concerns, says Jennifer French, executive director of Neurotech Network, a patient advocacy and support organization in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal point of moving towards clinical trials, testing these devices in larger groups of patients, but there are many questions around understanding the spectrum of risks versus benefits,\u201d she says. French listed many complex ethical questions, such as what are the clinical pathways for being fitted with devices? What should the clinical trial endpoints be? And how will health services make decisions about whether to pay for such devices?",
            "Another concern is what happens when devices fail, or the makers of a device go bankrupt and the person is left with unsupported or non-working implants. \u201cThis is a real risk, and we have seen it demonstrated,\u201d says Gaunt.",
            "French is working with regulatory partners, funders, patient-advocacy groups and other stakeholders to create clinical and research frameworks. \u201cWe need guidance,\u201d she says, both for device developers and clinicians. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have solutions yet.\u201d",
            "Imbrie is positive about the changes he has experienced since he first started testing the bionic arm that interfaces with his brain. Four years worth of tests have even helped him to relearn some of the natural sensations in parts of his body. \u201cWhen I started, my right side \u2014 it always felt dull or numb compared to the left side. Now when the doctor does the same test, both sides feel identical,\u201d he says. And these sensations are feeling increasingly real. \u201cI can feel my brain getting reprogrammed to feel different types of stimuli. It\u2019s like being a child learning to touch, but I have the language and imagination to describe how I\u2019m perceiving things,\u201d he says.",

One OVT, called T-VEC, has been in approved in the United States to treat metastatic melanoma, but there are as yet no OVT agents approved to treat breast cancer of any stage, anywhere in the world.

She chose to target her tumour with two different viruses consecutively \u2014 a measles virus followed by a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Both pathogens are known to infect the type of cell from which her tumour originated, and have already been used in OVT clinical trials.

People with cancer can be particularly susceptible to trying unproven treatments. Yet, he notes, it\u2019s also important to ensure that the knowledge that comes from self-experimentation isn\u2019t lost. The paper emphasizes that self-medicating with cancer-fighting viruses \u201cshould not be the first approach\u201d in the case of a cancer diagnosis. ",

She thinks it is unlikely that someone would try to copy her, because the treatment requires so much scientific knowledge and skill.

A fourth person with severely impaired vision also experienced gains in their sight, but they did not last. The four are the first to receive transplants made from reprogrammed stem cells to treat damaged corneas, the transparent outer surface of the eye1.",
            "The results, described in The Lancet today, are impressive, says Kapil Bharti, a translational stem-cell researcher at the US National Eye Institute, National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cThis is an exciting development.\u201d",

When this essential source of rejuvenation is depleted \u2014 a condition known as limbal stem-cell deficiency (LSCD) \u2014 scar tissue coats the cornea, eventually leading to blindness. It can result from trauma to the eye or from autoimmune or genetic diseases.",
            "Treatments for LSCD are limited. They typically involve transplanting corneal cells derived from stem cells obtained from a person\u2019s healthy eye, which is an invasive procedure with uncertain outcomes. When both eyes are affected, corneal transplants from deceased donors are an option, but these are sometimes rejected by the recipient\u2019s immune system. ",
            "Kohji Nishida, an ophthalmologist at Osaka University in Japan, and his colleagues used an alternative source of cells \u2014 induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells \u2014 to make the corneal transplants. They took blood cells from a healthy donor and reprogrammed them into an embryonic-like state, then transformed them into a thin, transparent sheet of cobblestone-shaped corneal epithelial cells.",
            "Between June 2019 and November 2020, the team enrolled two women and two men aged between 39 and 72 years old with LSCD in both eyes. As part of the surgery, the team scraped off the layer of scar tissue covering the damaged cornea in only one eye, then stitched on epithelial sheets derived from a donor and placed a soft protective contact lens on top.",

            "Two years after receiving the transplants, none of the recipients had experienced severe side effects. The grafts did not form tumours \u2014 a known risk of growing iPS cells \u2014 and did not show clear signs of being attacked by the recipients\u2019 immune systems, even in two patients who did not receive immunosuppressant drugs. \u201cIt is important and a relief to see grafts were not rejected,\u201d says Bharti. But more transplants are needed to be certain of the intervention\u2019s safety, he says.",
            "After the transplants, all four recipients showed immediate improvements in their vision, and a reduction in the area of the cornea affected by LSCD. The improvements persisted in all but one recipient, who showed slight reversals during a one-year observation period.",
            "Bharti says it isn\u2019t clear what exactly caused the vision improvements. It\u2019s possible that the transplanted cells themselves proliferated in the recipient\u2019s corneas. But the vision gains could also be due to the removal of scar tissue before the transplant, or the transplant triggering the recipient\u2019s own cells to migrate from other regions of the eye and rejuvenate the cornea. ",
            "Nishida says they plan to launch clinical trials in March to assess the treatment\u2019s efficacy. Several other iPS-cell-based trials are under way globally to treat eye diseases, says Bharti. \u201cThese success stories suggest we are headed in the right direction.\u201d",

Between 2019 and 2023, the number of private flights rose to more than four million a year, increasing emissions by 46%. The study, which was published on 7 November in Communications Earth and Environment1, found that private flights produced 15.6 million tonnes of CO2 in 2023, and identified events that trips were concentrated around, including the COP28 climate summit in Dubai last year.",

And, although the total CO2 emissions increased from 10.7 million to 15.6 million tonnes, the average emissions per kilometre decreased, which could be due to more efficient jet systems (see \u2018The jet set\u2019).",
            "Nearly 50% of the flights were shorter than 500 kilometres; such distances, Kl\u00f6wer says, could have been done by train or by car. And many journeys \u2014 as well as emissions \u2014 were clustered around major world events. For example, 172 of the 595 private planes that flew to the 2023 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were also seen at the Cannes Film Festival in France that year.

            "\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of misunderstanding and distress that individuals who are asymptomatic will have if we tell them they have Alzheimer\u2019s, whereas nothing will happen in their lifetime in a majority of cases,\u201d says Nicolas Villain, a neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, who co-wrote a paper1 published on 1 November in JAMA Neurology criticizing the new diagnostic criteria.",

            "\u201cIt\u2019s this confluence of the possibility of widespread clinically available, accurate diagnosis with the ability to do something about the disease that prompted us to update the criteria,\u201d says Clifford Jack, a specialist in clinical Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia research at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who co-led the effort to revise the diagnosis criteria. Jack and his colleagues in a working group for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, a non-profit research and advocacy organization in Chicago, Illinois, published their guidelines2 in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia in June.",
            "The criteria say that any one abnormal result on a core set of biomarker-based tests is sufficient to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s. These tests include measurements of amyloid and tau-protein levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and a positron-emission tomography (PET) brain scan, which helps to quantify amyloid plaques.",

            "The critics also argue that people who test positive for a single biomarker and are cognitively unimpaired should be informed that they are at risk of the disease but should not be given an official Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. A person without symptoms who either tests positive on multiple biomarker tests or has a gene variant known to significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s dementia could be given a diagnosis of \u2018presymptomatic\u2019 Alzheimer\u2019s, the critics write.",

And the working group does not recommend Alzheimer\u2019s biomarker tests for healthy people, so a hypothetical positive diagnosis for someone without symptoms should not come to pass, he says.",

            "But medications for biomarker-positive, asymptomatic people are currently non-existent except in clinical trials, says Andrea Bozoki, a cognitive neurologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill who co-wrote the JAMA Neurology critique. This would leave such people with the mental anguish of having a diagnosis for an incurable disease but lacking treatment options, she says.",
            "The new drugs that that slow the cognitive decline caused by the disease are approved in the United States only for people who are already experiencing mild cognitive impairment.",
            "Bozoki worries that the new criteria will spur healthy people who fear that they are at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s, or who have a family history of the disease, to find a doctor who will order a biomarker test for them. And if they\u2019re diagnosed, she says, they might be prescribed the new Alzheimer\u2019s drugs. These haven\u2019t been shown to be effective in asymptomatic populations, cost tens of thousands of US dollars a year and carry a risk of brain bleeding and fatal seizures.",
            "This will make it even more important for researchers and doctors to ensure that they are properly communicating risk and uncertainty as Alzheimer\u2019s tests and drugs become more available, says Winston Chiong, a neurologist and ethicist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved with either workgroup.",
