            "Growing immature eggs from old mice in the ovarian structures of young mice can reverse signs of ageing in the eggs1.",
            "\u201cThink of this as a five-star anti-ageing spa for the old egg,\u201d says Rong Li, a cell biologist at the National University of Singapore (NUS), who co-authored a study describing the results.",
            "When the rejuvenated eggs were fertilized, the resulting embryos were almost four times more likely to give rise to healthy pups than the eggs that matured in the old environment. The results are published in Nature Aging today.",

            "In mammalian ovaries, ovarian structures, known as follicles, house a maturing egg, called an oocyte. Once developed, these pop out as eggs, ready for fertilization. But with age, the number and quality of oocytes decline. Researchers have investigated the role of oocyte ageing in infertility2, but Li and her colleague Wang HaiYang, also a cell biologist at NUS, focused on ageing follicles.",
            "The latest study offers the \u201cfirst solid, strong evidence\u201d that follicles can improve the quality of maturing eggs, says Suzannah Williams, an ovarian biologist at the University of Oxford, UK. They\u2019ve \u201cdone a fantastic job\u201d.",
            "h2Old to young",
            "The researchers swapped out oocytes from 14-month-old mice that were close to becoming infertile and placed them into the follicles of 2-month-old mice, which were in their reproductive prime \u2014 and vice versa.",
            "They found that the quality of old oocytes improved when grown in young follicles compared with those grown in old follicles. Specifically, after the youthful treatment, the oocytes had fewer chromosomal abnormalities, improved mitochondrial function and their gene expression and metabolite-production profiles better resembled those of young oocytes.",
            "Meanwhile, young oocytes grown in old follicles showed increased signs of ageing.",
            "The researchers fertilized the eggs and transferred them into surrogate mice. Embryos that came from rejuvenated oocytes were significantly more likely to give rise to a pup than old oocytes grown in old follicles. However, the success rate didn\u2019t reach that of pups that arose from young oocytes grown in young follicles.",
            "The results suggests that oocyte ageing is partially reversible, and that the surrounding cellular environment plays an important part in the process, says Li.",
            "h2More connections",
            "The researchers took a closer look at what could be driving oocyte revival. Tunnel-like structures that connect follicles to oocytes, known as transzonal projections (TZPs), pump important molecules for nourishing oocytes. The researchers found a higher density of TZPs in old oocytes embedded in young follicles compared with those embedded in old follicles.",
            "If the findings translate to people, Li suggests that this could lead to cell therapies that improve egg quality in older people.",
            "But Williams says that this translation will be tricky, given the difficulties of acquiring sufficient donor tissue and growing them for long enough in the laboratory. Still, she says \u201cit\u2019s a proof of concept\u201d.",

            "The warnings come off the back of one of the largest studies1 of viruses harboured by fur animals in China. The team, which included Holmes, found a broad array of viruses \u2014 including new pathogens and known ones found in new hosts. The study was published in Nature on Wednesday.",
            "Researchers have long suspected that these animals are a reservoir of viruses that can jump to people, says Alice Hughes, a conservation biologist at the University of Hong Kong. The analysis \u201chighlights that these concerns are valid, and that the diversity of viruses with known risks to humans is even greater than was realized\u201d. Hughes says the industry should mandate transitioning to artificial fur.",
            "The other option is to improve regulation and oversight of the fur trade, says Hughes. This includes ensuring the implementation of measures such as animal quarantines, reducing overcrowding and rules around cleaning cages, sourcing feed and waste disposal, she says.",
            "Linfa Wang, a virologist at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, says the animal-farming and animal-trading industries need to be monitored closely for emerging diseases.",
            "Mark Oaten, chief executive of the International Fur Federation in London, which represents farms in more than 40 countries, says farms should operate under the highest biosecurity standards. \u201cThe prevention and surveillance measures undertaken by fur farmers continue being the best toolbox to further mitigate any risk for the general public\u2019s health,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Global industry",
            "Fur farming is a global industry, although most farms are found in Europe and China. In 2016, farms in Europe produced 39.05 million mink pelts; Chinese farms produced 26.16 million such pelts.",
            "Many animals farmed for their fur are susceptible to human viruses. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 spread through mink farms across Europe. But Oaten says studies of these outbreaks found that farmers were not driving the spread of the virus in the general population, and that prevention and surveillance measures implemented by farmers are \u201cthe best toolbox to further mitigate any risk for the general public health.\u201d",
            "Mink farms have also had outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus. And a popular fur animal, the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), could have played a part in bringing the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome to people in 20032. Raccoon dogs are also susceptible to, and can spread, SARS-CoV-23.",
            "Holmes and his colleagues, including several in China, sought to identify the viruses circulating in farms in China. They swabbed lung and gut tissue samples for 461 animals that died between 2021 and 2024. Of these animals, 164 came from four species farmed exclusively for fur: mink (Neogale vison), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and raccoon dog. The individuals were predominantly from intensive breeding facilities in northeastern China. The rest came from farmed and wild animals used for fur as well as food and traditional medicine, spread more broadly across eastern China. These included guinea pigs, deer and rabbits. The animals had all been sick and had probably died of an infectious disease.",
            "The researchers sequenced RNA and DNA in the tissue samples and found a trove of viruses: 125 were identified in total, including many influenza viruses and coronaviruses.",
            "Of these, 36 had never been seen before, and many were found in species not previously known to host them. For instance, they found the Japanese encephalitis virus in guinea pigs and norovirus in mink.",
            "h2Human receptor",
            "The researchers found an H6N2 avian influenza virus in a muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) \u2014 the first known identification of this subtype in mammals. And most notably, they found in mink a HKU5-like coronavirus related to viruses that have so far been identified only in bats \u2014 evidence that fur farms can act as a highway for viruses lurking in wild animals to get to people.",
            "These viruses \u201cstand out to me the most\u201d, says Michael Letko, a molecular virologist at Washington State University in Pullman. Studies in Letko\u2019s laboratory have shown that some HKU5 viruses might be able to adapt to the human ACE2 receptor to enter cells4, just as certain viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, do. \u201cA deeper dive into these newly discovered viruses will be important, in order to understand their risk to other animals,\u201d he says.",
            "The researchers classified some three dozen viruses as most concerning, because of their ability to jump between species. Raccoon dogs and mink each carried ten of these high-risk viruses \u2014 the most of any species.",
            "Wang says the findings need to be corroborated with epidemiological studies to assess how widespread the viruses are, and infection studies in the lab, which can demonstrate the risk of these viruses infecting people. Even without that evidence, he says, the highest risk of a new pathogen emerging in people \u201cis in the animal industry\u201d.",

            "Pathoplexus \u2014 a portmanteau of pathogen and plexus \u2014 was launched last month, and the team of scientists behind the database hopes that it will encourage more researchers to share genetic sequences of known and emerging viruses of public-health importance.",
            "Sharing sequences as quickly as possible is important for identifying new viruses and tracking changes that could make them more dangerous to humans, as well as for designing vaccines, says Edward Holmes, a virologist at the University of Sydney in Australia.",
            "Pathoplexus currently focuses on four viruses that are not specifically included in other databases: Crimean\u2013Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus, Ebola Sudan, Ebola Zaire and West Nile Virus. Other pathogens will be added later, the team says.",
            "h2Existing hurdles",
            "Among the largest existing repositories is GenBank in the United States, which offers unrestricted access to its genomic data. But public access means that anyone can theoretically use the data to publish scientific papers, without acknowledging the data owners. This has discouraged scientists, particularly those from lower-income countries, from sharing their data quickly, such as during a public-health emergency. An alternative repository, GISAID, requires users to register, agree to acknowledge the data owners and make their best efforts to collaborate with the owners. The database was designed to ensure the rights of data submitters.",
            "GISAID was hugely popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, and it contains close to 17 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID-19. But researchers have raised concerns around transparency in its governance, how it mediates disputes over credit and how it sanctions those it thinks to have violated its conditions for use.",
            "\u201cGISAID has led to a lot of frustration in the past few years,\u201d but the scientific community has also learnt lessons on how to do things better, says Spyros Lytras, an evolutionary virologist at the University of Tokyo. \u201cStarting from scratch is what we need as a community, and Pathoplexus might be the solution.\u201d",
            "A representative for GISAID said in an e-mail that the trust it has with the scientific community is strong, and that more than 70,000 researchers use the site. The roles of its governing bodies and funding sources are displayed on its website, and their terms of use haven\u2019t changed since it was founded in 2008, the representative said.",
            "h2Building trust",
            "Pathoplexus offers some protections for users. For instance, researchers can set restrictions on how their data are used, such as not allowing them to be included as a key focus of scientific publications for up to a year without their explicit permission. This should give data owners enough time to submit a manuscript on their findings.",
            "Users must also credit the data owners in their publications. \u201cWe aim to build a community where researchers feel confident that their contributions will be respected and properly credited,\u201d says Jamie Southgate, a member of Pathoplexus and the head of operations at the global coalition Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology, based in Cape Town, South Africa.",
            "Pathoplexus doesn\u2019t block individuals who breach the terms of use from accessing the site, which GISAID has done in rare cases. Instead, if published data breach the terms, the team will approach the journals to ensure that the data are used in accordance with the way in which they were shared, says Emma Hodcroft, a co-founder of Pathoplexus and a molecular epidemiologist at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel, Switzerland. \u201cWe have tried to be incredibly explicit\u201d about the terms, she says.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a good, clever solution,\u201d says Senjuti Saha, a molecular microbiologist at the Child Health Research Foundation in Dhaka, who agrees with the approach of reaching out to publishers. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d She thinks that Pathoplexus\u2019s transparency will breed trust among the scientific community.",
            "But it\u2019s too early to say whether the repository will solve the current data-sharing problems, says Saha. \u201cIt is an excellent and fantastic first step.\u201d",
            "Users might also stick to sharing sequences on local databases. For instance, in China, researchers are probably more likely to publish sequences for emerging viruses on Chinese databases, says Shi Mang, an evolutionary biologist at Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, China, who is also on Pathoplexus\u2019s scientific advisory board. But for established viruses, they are likely to use repositories with well-maintained collections, which Pathoplexus offers.",
            "h2Improved experience",
            "Pathoplexus\u2019s creators have tried to improve the user experience, such as making uploading as easy as possible. Pathoplexus also checks for errors in the sequence data and accompanying information and assists with organizing viruses into subtypes. \u201cThis is actually what attracted me to this database,\u201d says Shi. Incorrect sequences in current repositories can cause lots of trouble for researchers, he says.",
            "So far, Pathoplexus has used GenBank data for the four viruses to populate the site. Thousands of people have visited the site, and 50 have created accounts to submit data, but none have submitted sequences, says Hodcroft. \u201cWe did not expect high volumes of data for the pathogens that we\u2019ve launched with.\u201d",
            "Researchers who work on other viruses will have to wait until the database expands to include them. And to expand, the team needs to secure long-term funding. The site is currently being run by volunteers and donated computing time, which ends in about six months. Hodcroft says her priority right now is to appeal to donors. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously hopeful.\u201d",

Applying the dye to the skin of live mice allowed scientists to peer through tissues at the structures below, including blood vessels and internal organs. The method, described in Science on 6 September1, could offer a less invasive way to monitor live animals used in medical research.",

            "The technique works by changing how body tissues that are normally opaque interact with light. The fluids, fats and proteins that make up tissues such as skin and muscle have different refractive indices (a measurement of how much a material bends light): aqueous components have low refractive indices, whereas lipids and proteins have high ones. Tissues appear opaque because the contrast between these refractive indices causes light to be scattered. The researchers speculated that adding a dye that strongly absorbs light to such tissues could narrow the gap between the components\u2019 refractive indices enough to make them transparent.",

The team used theoretical physics to predict how certain molecules would alter how mouse tissues interacted with light. Several candidates emerged, but the team focused on tartrazine, or FD&C Yellow 5, a common dye used in many processed foods. \u201cWhen tartrazine is dissolved in water, it makes water bend light more like fats do,\u201d says Hong. A tissue containing fluids and lipids becomes transparent when the dye is added, because the light refraction of fluids matches that of lipids.",

They then massaged the dye into various areas of a live mouse\u2019s skin. Applying the dye to the scalp allowed the team to scrutinize tiny zigzags of blood vessels; putting it on the abdomen offered a clear view of the mouse\u2019s intestines contracting with digestion, and revealed other movements tied to breathing. The team also used the solution on the mouse\u2019s leg, and were able to discern muscle fibres beneath the skin.",
            "\n\nTransparent tissues bring cells into focus for microscopy\n",
            "The technique can make tissues transparent only to a depth of around 3 millimetres, so it is currently of limited practical use for thicker tissues and larger animals.",
            "But because tartrazine is a food dye, it is safe to use on living mice, and the method is reversible \u2014 when the dye is rinsed off, the skin simply returns to being opaque. This offers a huge advantage over existing methods of making tissue transparent, which are not typically suitable for live animals, and often involve using chemicals to change the refractive index of certain tissue components, or to remove them all together.",
            "The fact that the method produces transparency, is reversible and can be used on live animals \u201cis going to make it an obvious thing that that many people would want to use\u201d, Keller says. Among other applications, he thinks it could be useful in mouse models that aim to understand the nervous system and neurodegenerative diseases.",

For instance, because wildfires have worsened in Canada, there are now \u201csix weeks of the year where it\u2019s too smoky and hot to let my kid go outside, and my kid has asthma\u201d, Burgess says. She remembers only a handful of smoky days when she was growing up, so she shares that experience to help people process the changes they are seeing.",

Using this strategy with climate change specifically is still being systematically tested.",

            "The smell in the laboratory was new. It was, in the language of the business, tenacious: for more than a week, the odour clung to the paper on which it had been blotted.",
            "To researcher Alex Wiltschko, it was the smell of summertime in Texas: watermelon, but more precisely, the boundary where the red flesh transitions into white rind.",
            "\u201cIt was a molecule that nobody had ever seen before,\u201d says Wiltschko, who runs a company called Osmo, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His team created the compound, called 533, as part of its mission to understand and digitize smell. His goal \u2014 to develop a system that can detect, predict or create odours \u2014 is a tall order, as molecule 533 shows. \u201cIf you looked at the structure, you would never have guessed that it smelled this way.\u201d",
            "That\u2019s one of the problems with understanding smell: the chemical structure of a molecule tells you almost nothing about its odour. Two chemicals with very similar structures can smell wildly different; and two wildly different chemical structures can produce an almost identical odour. And most smells \u2014 coffee, Camembert, ripe tomatoes \u2014 are mixtures of many tens or hundreds of aroma molecules, intensifying the challenge of understanding how chemistry gives rise to olfactory experience.",
            "Another problem is working out how smells relate to each other. With vision, the spectrum is a simple colour palette: red, green, blue and all their swirling intermediates. Sounds have a frequency and a volume, but for smell there are no obvious parameters. Where does an odour identifiable as \u2018frost\u2019 sit in relation to \u2018sauna\u2019? It\u2019s a real challenge to make predictions about smell, says Joel Mainland, a neuroscientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, an independent research institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",
            "\n\nHow do we smell? First 3D structure of human odour receptor offers clues\n",
            "Animals, including humans, have evolved a remarkably complex decoding system befitting the enormous repertoire of odour molecules. All sensory information is processed by receptors, and odour is no different \u2014 except in its scale. For light, the human eye has two types of receptor cell; for smell, there are 400. How the signals from these receptors combine to trigger a particular perception is unclear. Plus, the receptor proteins themselves are hard to work with, so what they look like and how they function has mostly been guesswork.",
            "Things are beginning to change, however, thanks to improvements in structural biology, data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Many scientists hope that cracking the olfactory code will help them to understand how animals use this essential sense to find food or mates, and how it feeds into memory, emotion, stress, appetite and more.",
            "Others are trying to digitize smell to build new technologies: devices that diagnose disease on the basis of odours; better, safer insect repellents; and affordable or more-effective aroma molecules for the US$30-billion flavour and fragrance market. At least 20 start-up firms are trying to make electronic noses for applications in health and public safety.",
            "This all adds up to a surge of research into the biology of olfaction, says Sandeep Robert Datta, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cSmell is having a moment,\u201d he says.",

            "Researchers have come up with a few computational models that can relate structure to odour, but early versions tended to be based on quite narrow data sets or could only make predictions when smells had been calibrated to have the same perceived intensity. In 2020, one team reported a model that could predict how similar real-world mixtures were to each other, correctly identifying that rose and violet odorants are more similar to one another than either is to the pungent spice asafoetida, often used in Indian cuisine1.",
            "Previous attempts to use machine learning were good, but not great. For example, when researchers ran a competition to create the best odour-predicting model, algorithms from 22 teams could effectively predict only 8 out of 19 smell descriptors2.",
            "\n\nCould rats and dogs detect disease better than the finest lab equipment?\n",

            "Their program was trained by feeding the model thousands of descriptions of molecular structures from fragrance catalogues, along with smell labels for each \u2014 terms such as \u2018beefy\u2019 or \u2018floral\u2019.",
            "Then, the researchers compared the AI system with human noses. They trained 15 panellists to rate a few hundred aromas using 55 labels, such as \u2018smoky\u2019, \u2018tropical\u2019 and \u2018waxy\u2019.",
            "Humans have a hard time with this task because smell is so subjective. \u201cThere\u2019s no universal truth,\u201d says Mainland. Most smell descriptions lack detail, too. For one smell, panellists chose the words \u2018sharp, sweet, roasted, buttery\u2019. A master perfumer, asked to describe the same smell, noted \u2018ski lodge, fireplace without a fire\u2019. \u201cThat shows you the gap,\u201d says Mainland. \u201cOur lexicon is not good enough.\u201d Nonetheless, a human panel is one of the best available tools for coming up with consistent smell descriptors because the average rankings of the group for different smells tend to be stable.",
            "Using the structure of these molecules alone, the AI algorithm did well at predicting the smell of compounds compared with the average group assessments (see \u2018Same but different\u2019), and it performed better than the typical individual sniffer.

Another goal is to have the model design new odours, for instance chemicals that mimic a specific scent, or that are safer, more sustainable or biodegradable.",

But the expertise and ingenuity of human chemists and flavourists \u2014 plus their highly trained noses \u2014 will still be necessary for innovation.",

            "For both expert and amateur sniffers, the biological equipment for smell detection is the same. The nose has millions of olfactory neurons, and each typically expresses just one type of odorant receptor (OR). The gene family that encodes them was discovered4 in the early 1990s and won Linda Buck and Richard Axel a Nobel prize in 2004.",
            "Each of these receptor types might recognize one or more odorants \u2014 and each odorant might be recognized by more than one receptor. Together, the roughly 400 human ORs can respond to a trillion different chemicals. It\u2019s a fiendishly complex, exquisitely tuned, flexible system \u2014 and it needs to be, because the chemistry of nature is incredibly diverse, says Aashish Manglik, a biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cThe breadth of chemicals that make odours is enormous.\u201d One important step in cracking the code of smell is to know what the receptors look like and how they recognize chemicals. But they have been notoriously difficult to study. \u201cThey\u2019re the most recalcitrant membrane proteins to work with,\u201d says Manglik. Many are too unstable to be expressed in cells in the lab and to generate enough protein to analyse.",
            "Scientists have deciphered the structure of two ORs from insects5,6. These receptors are of a totally different type to those in mammals, although the olfactory \u2018logic\u2019 by which they work together is likely to be similar, says sensory neuroscientist Vanessa Ruta, whose lab at the Rockefeller University in New York solved both the structures.",
            "Two more receptor structures7,8, from the olfactory system in mice, followed last year. Both of them sense a bunch of chemicals with distinctly unlikeable fishy, musky or putrid odours, many of which are key components of bodily odours in animals.",
            "Getting at these structures has required some \u201cfunky approaches\u201d, says Manglik, because ORs are so hard to grow in the lab. But last year, he was part of a team that succeeded in publishing the first protein structure of a human olfactory receptor bound to an odorant9.",
            "Having tried almost every OR that they could, Manglik and colleagues found one that is richly expressed outside the nose, in the gut and prostate, and which could, as a result, be made more readily in commonly used cell lines. It\u2019s a receptor called OR51E2 and it responds to the chemical propionate, which has a pungent, cheesy odour.",

            "Using cryo-electron microscopy, the team looked at how propionate binds to the receptor in a little pocket, and how that binding changes the receptor\u2019s shape and conveys information onwards. Seeing the structure \u201cwas really thrilling\u201d, says Buck, whose lab at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington, studies olfactory neuroscience.",
            "But ORs can detect so many odorants that \u201cthe structure of one OR can\u2019t tell us much\u201d, says Hiro Matsunami, an olfaction biologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who collaborated with Manglik on the study of OR51E2.",
            "Alongside trying to grow more of them, Matsunami and his colleagues have attempted to understand the OR by re-engineering it. They made some synthetic receptors using OR51E2 and parts from two dozen similar receptors. They aligned the amino-acid sequences of these existing ORs, and chose the most frequent amino acid at each position to build an average, or \u2018consensus\u2019, structure. Then they expressed the structure in cells. When they compared their synthetic structure with its real-life counterpart, OR51E2, it looked and behaved just like its sibling10.",
            "Next, they tried building another averaged receptor based on an OR with no published structure \u2014 OR1A1 \u2014 which recognizes a broad range of odorants including some that smell fruity, floral and minty. They used a computational model to explore how it bound to two compounds that both smell of menthol; the compounds bound to the receptor in different places.",
            "The team thinks that different odorants probably engage a single OR in distinct ways. That would help to explain the level of complexity in the smell code \u2014 and could explain why, for example, two disparate chemicals can have similar odours, or why chemically similar compounds can smell so different. The compound carvone, for instance, comes in two varieties that are mirror images of each other; one smells of spearmint, the other of caraway or dill. \u201cThere must be a receptor that can explain this,\u201d says Matsunami.",
            "Some researchers are using machine learning to accelerate the search for structures and their preferred chemical partners. Right now, scientists have identified odour molecules that bind to only about 20% of human ORs.",
            "The protein-prediction algorithm AlphaFold has suggested thousands of structures for mammalian odorant receptors11. And machine learning and modelling has helped Matsunami and his colleagues to screen millions of compounds to see which ones might bind to two candidate OR structures12. One of the molecules they found smells of orange blossom; another strongly of honey.",
            "The dream end point is to gather data on hundreds of ORs and how their activation lines up with the chemistry of millions of odorants, says Manglik.",
            "h2Lead with the nose",
            "Once a smell is processed by receptors, this information proceeds to a brain region called the olfactory bulb, which sits behind the bridge of the nose, and onwards to the olfactory cortex. The circuitry for olfaction before information enters the cortex is well understood, particularly in model organisms such as fruit flies and mice. But the olfactory cortex is more of a mystery. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to figure out what\u2019s happening there,\u201d says Buck.",
            "Many researchers want to understand how information from receptors is organized in the brain, and what rules govern perception. If that were understood, it might be possible to get an animal to perceive a certain smell without even presenting an odorant, simply by recreating the pattern it generates in the brain, says Dima Rinberg, a neuroscientist who studies smell at New York University School of Medicine.",
            "\n\nHuman nose can detect 1 trillion odours\n",
            "Another big unknown, Datta says, is how the olfactory system interacts with other crucial brain circuits, such as those that control movement or navigation. Several labs, including his own, are interested in how animals actively sense scent and move towards or away from odours.",
            "Capturing the connection between scent and behaviour is already possible to some extent in the brains of insects. In fruit flies, for instance, scientists can explore chemical structure, receptors and the brain in a single system. \u201cIn insects you can start to span the whole spectrum,\u201d says Ruta.",
            "Insects\u2019 sense of smell is also relevant to human health. Mosquitoes evolved to sniff out humans, and many insects prey on crops that humans rely on. Last November, Osmo announced a $3.5-million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, aimed at discovering and producing compounds that repel, attract or destroy insects that carry disease.",
            "Meanwhile, detecting scents is also big business. For some tasks and applications, \u2018electronic noses\u2019 are already commercially available: some are designed to detect off odours in food or to pick up smells in waste water. They are being intensively studied as diagnostics for diseases such as TB, diabetes and various cancers.",
            "But natural sniffers still have an edge, and even without a full understanding of how brains process smell, scientists can exploit biological noses to improve chemical sensing for safety, security or health care.",
            "The classic example is the sniffer dog, widely used to sense chemicals in explosives or narcotics \u2014 but these animals are expensive to train and there are limits to what they can detect.",
            "Rinberg\u2019s team is aiming to blend animal and digital odour detection. They developed a nose\u2013computer interface in mice13, using electrodes that record signals from the olfactory bulb as mice smell different compounds. The researchers can decode odour identities from neural activity, and then use the patterns to flag these smells under natural conditions. Their device, which is now being developed by a start-up called Canaery, co-founded by Rinberg, retains the precision of the animal\u2019s sense of smell without researchers having to train the animal to respond. \u201cThe biological nose is the best chemical detector,\u201d Rinberg says. \u201cThe whole machinery is hard to beat.\u201d",
            "Despite the pre-eminence of biology, many scientists dream of a time when a digital smell sensor will rival those for other senses. \u201cSmartphones can do image and audio recognition,\u201d says Ruta. \u201cBut for olfaction there\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d",
            "And although they know how well biological noses work, researchers still have a lot of outstanding questions. For Buck, the simplest to pose could be the most difficult to answer. \u201cIt would be nice to know how you get a perception of a particular odorant,\u201d she says \u2014 how the brain, beyond the nose, creates a sense of rose, for instance, and how it distinguishes it from the essence of fish. \u201cHow does that happen in the brain? No one knows,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the techniques to figure that out yet.\u201d",

            "The fastest supercomputer in the world is a machine known as Frontier, but even this speedster with nearly 50,000 processors has its limits. On a sunny Monday in April, its power consumption is spiking as it tries to keep up with the amount of work requested by scientific groups around the world.",
            "The electricity demand peaks at around 27 megawatts, enough to power roughly 10,000 houses, says Bronson Messer, director of science at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where Frontier is located. With a note of pride in his voice, Messer uses a local term to describe the supercomputer\u2019s work rate: \u201cThey are running the machine like a scalded dog.\u201d",
            "Frontier churns through data at record speed, outpacing 100,000 laptops working simultaneously. When it debuted in 2022, it was the first to break through supercomputing\u2019s exascale speed barrier \u2014 the capability of executing an exaflop, or 1018 floating point operations per second. The Oak Ridge behemoth is the latest chart-topper in a decades-long global trend of pushing towards larger supercomputers (although it is possible that faster computers exist in military labs or otherwise secret facilities).",
            "\n\nHow cutting-edge computer chips are speeding up the AI revolution\n",
            "But speed and size are secondary to Frontier\u2019s main purpose \u2014 to push the bounds of human knowledge. Frontier excels at creating simulations that capture large-scale patterns with small-scale details, such as how tiny cloud droplets can affect the pace at which Earth\u2019s climate warms. Researchers are using the supercomputer to create cutting-edge models of everything from subatomic particles to galaxies. Some projects are simulating proteins to help develop new drugs, modelling turbulence to improve aeroplane engine design and creating open-source large language models (LLMs) to compete with the artificial intelligence (AI) tools from Google and OpenAI.",
            "Researchers log on to Frontier from all over the world. In 2023, the supercomputer had 1,744 users in 18 countries. And, in 2024, Oak Ridge anticipates that Frontier users will publish at least 500 papers based on computations performed on the machine.",
            "\u201cFrontier is not unlike the James Webb Space Telescope,\u201d says biophysicist Dilip Asthagiri of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. \u201cWe should see it as a scientific instrument.\u201d",
            "h2Inside the machine",
            "The brains of Frontier reside in a warehouse-sized room filled with a steady electronic hum that is gentle enough to talk over. In the room are 74 identical glossy black racks that hold a total of 9,408 nodes. These are the workhorses of a supercomputer. Each node consists of four graphics processing units (GPUs) and one computer processing unit (CPU).",
            "A team of engineers continuously monitors the machine for signs of trouble, says Corey Edmonds, a technician at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the company that built the supercomputer. Edmonds, who is based at Oak Ridge, is doing maintenance surgery on Frontier on this day. After fixing a broken connector on one of the nodes, he squeezes grey thermal grease from a syringe on to a silvery rectangle \u2014 one of the node\u2019s four GPUs. This helps the GPU to dissipate heat quickly and stay cool.",
            "Frontier owes its speed mainly to its extensive use of GPUs. These chips, first developed to render realistic graphics for computer gamers, are now powering advances in AI through machine-learning applications.",
            "\u201cThey can run really fast,\u201d says Messer. \u201cThey\u2019re also abysmally stupid.\u201d GPUs excel at crunching many numbers at once \u2014 and not much else. \u201cThey can do one thing over and over and over and over again,\u201d he says, which makes them useful for speedy work in supercomputer calculations.",
            "Researchers have to customize their code to take advantage of Frontier\u2019s GPUs. Messer likens a scientist using Frontier for the first time to a suburban driver commandeering a race car. \u201cIt\u2019s got a steering wheel, gas pedal and a brake,\u201d he says. \u201cBut try to get a regular driver into a Formula One car and actually have them go from here to there.\u201d",
            "h2Big science",
            "It\u2019s not easy for researchers to get a chance to use Frontier. Messer and three colleagues are gathering on this April Monday to evaluate research proposals for the machine. On average, they approve around one in four proposals, and last year awarded time to 131 projects. In particular, applicants need to make the case that their project can take advantage of the supercomputer\u2019s entire system.",
            "The most common allocations they offer are around 500,000 node hours, equivalent to running the entire machine for three days continuously. Their largest allocation is four times bigger. Researchers who are granted time on Frontier get about ten times more computing resources than they can procure anywhere else, says Messer.",
            "Today, his team is doling out smaller awards of around 20,000 node hours, which it does on a weekly basis. Many projects take advantage of Frontier\u2019s ability to simultaneously model a wide range of spatial and time scales. In total, Frontier has about 65 million node-hours available each year.",

            "Scientists want to use Frontier, for example, to simulate atomically accurate biological processes, such as proteins or nucleic acids in solution interacting with other parts of cells.",
            "This May, Asthagiri and Nick Hagerty, a high-performance-computing engineer at Oak Ridge, used Frontier to simulate a cube-shaped drop of liquid water containing more than 155 billion water molecules. \u201cIt was to push the machine,\u201d says Asthagiri. The simulated cube is about one-tenth the width of a human hair, and the model is among the largest atomic-level simulations ever made, says Asthagiri, who has not yet published the work in a peer-reviewed journal.",
            "These initial simulations are building towards more ambitious goals to model entire cells from the atoms up. In the near term, researchers would like to simulate a cellular organelle and use these to inform laboratory experiments. They are also working to combine Frontier\u2019s high-resolution simulations of biological materials with ultra-fast imaging using X-ray free-electron lasers to accelerate discoveries.",
            "With Frontier, climate models have become more precise, too. In 2023, Oak Ridge climate scientist Matt Norman and other researchers used the supercomputer to run a global climate model with 3.25-kilometre resolution. Frontier\u2019s computing capability was necessary for them to create a decades-long forecast at this resolution1. The model also incorporated the effects of the complex motion of clouds, which occurs on an even finer resolution. \u201cIt took all of Frontier to do it,\u201d says Norman.",
            "Models would run significantly more slowly on other computers to achieve the same resolution while including the effects from clouds, he says. This limitation is a major hurdle for climate scientists seeking to forecast conditions, because cloud behaviour influences the movement of energy around the globe.",
            "\n\nSupercomputing poised for a massive speed boost\n",
            "For a model to be practical for weather and climate forecasts, it needs to run at least one simulated year per day. Frontier could run through 1.26 simulated years per day for this model1, a rate that will allow the researchers to create more-accurate 50-year forecasts than before.",
            "Frontier also brings higher resolution to cosmological scales. Astrophysicist Evan Schneider at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania is using the supercomputer to study how Milky Way-sized galaxies evolve as they age. Frontier\u2019s galaxy models span four orders of magnitude, up to large-scale galactic structures about 100,000 light years (30,660 parsecs) in size. Before Frontier, the largest structures she could model at comparable resolution were dwarf galaxies, which are about one-fiftieth the mass.",
            "Schneider simulates how supernovae cause gas to leak out of these galaxies2. Over time, thousands to millions of supernova explosions collectively release a significant amount of gas that ultimately exits the galaxy3. Because that gas is the raw material from which new stars are born, star formation slows down as the galaxies age. Frontier allows Schneider to include the effects of hotter gas than is practical with other computers. Her simulations suggest that current cosmological models downplay the role of this hot gas in the evolution of galaxies.",
            "AI researchers are also clamouring for time on Frontier\u2019s GPUs, known for their role in training neural-network-based architectures such as the transformer model underpinning ChatGPT. With its nearly 38,000 GPUs, Frontier occupies a unique public-sector role in the field of AI research, which is otherwise dominated by industry.",
            "Nur Ahmed, an economics researcher now at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, and his colleagues highlighted the gap between AI in academia and industry in a commentary last year4. In 2021, 96% of the largest AI models came from industry. On average, industry models were nearly 30 times the size of academic models. The discrepancy is evident in monetary investment, too. Non-defence US agencies provided US$1.5 billion to support AI research in 2021. In that same year, industry spent more than $340 billion globally.",
            "h2Mind the gap",
            "The gap has only widened since the release of commercial large language models, says Ahmed. The computational resources to train OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, for example, cost an estimated $78 million, whereas Google spent $191 million to train Gemini Ultra (see go.nature.com/44ihnhx). This gulf in investment leads to a stark asymmetry in the computing resources available to researchers in industry versus academia.",
            "Industry is pushing the boundaries of basic AI research, and this could pose a problem for the field, write Ahmed and his co-authors. Industry dominance could lead to a lack of basic research that is not immediately profitable and result, for example, in the development of AI technologies that neglect the needs of lower-income communities, say the researchers. In an unpublished study, Ahmed has analysed 6 million peer-reviewed articles and 32 million patent citations and found that \u201con average, industry tends to ignore some of the concerns of marginalized populations in the global south\u201d.",
            "\n\nClimate scientists push for access to world\u2019s biggest supercomputers to build better Earth models\n",
            "What\u2019s more, many models have problems with gender and racial bias, as found in several commercial face-recognition systems based on AI. Academics could serve as auditors to evaluate the risks from AI models, but to do so they need access to computational resources at the same scale as industry, says Ahmed.",
            "That\u2019s where Frontier comes in. Once Oak Ridge approves a project application, the researcher uses the supercomputer for free, as long as they publish their results. That will help university researchers to compete with companies, says computer scientist Abhinav Bhatele at the University of Maryland in College Park. \u201cThe only way people in academia can train similar-sized models is if they have access to resources like Frontier,\u201d he says.",
            "Bhatele is using Frontier to develop open-source LLMs as a counterbalance to industry models5. \u201cOften when companies train their models, they keep them proprietary, and they don\u2019t release the model weights,\u201d says Bhatele. \u201cWith this open research, we can make these models freely available for anyone to use.\u201d Over the next year, he and his team aim to train a range of LLMs of different sizes, and they will make these models, along with their weights, open-source. They have also made the software for training the models freely available. In this way, says Bhatele, Frontier has a crucial role in a movement in the field to \u201cdemocratize\u201d AI \u2014 to include more people in the technology\u2019s development.",
            "h2The race continues",
            "A few doors down from the room housing Frontier, its predecessor is still working hard performing jobs for scientists around the world. This machine, called Summit, held the world record for speed between 2018 and 2019 and is currently the world\u2019s ninth-fastest supercomputer among public machines. With its long black chrome racks, Summit resembles Frontier, but has a louder cooling system and works at one-eighth the speed.",
            "Summit\u2019s history hints at Frontier\u2019s future. Frontier first topped the list in 2022, and is likely to surrender that spot before long. The second-place supercomputer, Aurora, based at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, is expected to exceed Frontier\u2019s performance at some point with further optimization. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\u2019s El Capitan, scheduled to come online later this year at the California-based lab, is also projected to beat Frontier eventually. Also in the mix is Jupiter, an exascale supercomputer in Germany that is due to debut later this year.",
            "Mounting geopolitical tensions further complicate the rankings. Frontier\u2019s title comes from its position on a semiannual ranking from an organization called the TOP500. It rates the world\u2019s supercomputers on the basis of their reported performance on a benchmark task that involves solving a dense set of linear equations.",
            "But computing experts say it is likely that the United States and China are not sharing information publicly about their computing assets, especially because of increasing strain between the two countries. \u201cThere is this idea of a kind of a race in supercomputing,\u201d says Kevin Klyman, a policy researcher at the Atlantic Council, a think tank in Washington DC. In fact, in 2022, the administration of US President Joe Biden implemented controls against exporting semiconductors to China, specifically citing concern about China\u2019s supercomputing capability.",
            "In the supercomputing arena, the tensions began years ago. Notably, in 2016, China overtook the United States in the number of supercomputers on the TOP500 list. \u201cThat caused a lot of anxiety in the United States,\u201d says Klyman. \u201cA lot of US policymakers said, \u2018How do we catch up in the list?\u2019\u201d",
            "Currently, the two countries have the most supercomputers on the TOP500 rankings released this June. The United States boasted 168 machines, whereas China had 80. Researchers wonder, however, whether these countries have powerful supercomputers that they have not disclosed in public. In fact, the number of Chinese machines on the current list has dropped since last November, when it included 104 machines. And China did not report results for any new supercomputers.",

It will be the latest in a decades-long quest for speed (see \u2018Speed records\u2019).

So researchers are continuing to push for improvements in energy efficiency. Frontier is more than four times as efficient as Summit, in large part because it is cooled by water at an ambient temperature, unlike Summit, which uses chilled water. About 3\u20134% of Frontier\u2019s total energy consumption goes to cooling, compared with 10% for Summit.",

They did this by synchronizing the energy transition with the tick of the world\u2019s most accurate clock. The work was led by Jun Ye at JILA, a research institute in Boulder, Colorado, and published in Nature on 5 September1. \u201cIt\u2019s really one of the most exciting papers in recent times,\u201d says Marianna Safronova, an atomic physicist at the University of Delaware in Newark.",

And because the clock\u2019s frequency is set by the fundamental forces that hold the nucleus together, the prototype could spot whether a type of dark matter \u2014 an invisible substance that accounts for around 85% of material in the Universe \u2014 affects these forces on a minuscule scale. \u201cThis is a new, direct window onto the nuclear force,\u201d says Fuchs.",

The most accurate atomic clock gains or loses only one second every 40 billion years. A nuclear clock would work slightly differently: the tick would correspond to the energy transitions of protons and neutrons, rather than electrons, as they reshuffle into an excited state.",
            "This energy shift requires a slightly higher, ultraviolet frequency, resulting in a faster tick rate that could match or surpass the accuracy of the atomic clock. But the nuclear clock\u2019s biggest potential advantage is the combination of precision and stability. Particles in the nucleus are less sensitive than electrons to disturbances such as electromagnetic fields \u2014 meaning that a nuclear clock could be portable and robust. \u201cIt becomes insensitive in a way that is kind of unthinkable in terms of how our clocks work today,\u201d says Anne Curtis, an experimental physicist at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington, UK.",

In the 1970s, indirect evidence suggested that thorium-229 had a bizarrely low-energy nuclear transition2 \u2014 one that might eventually be triggered by tabletop lasers. But it wasn\u2019t until last year that scientists discovered the required frequency3 \u2014 and this year, they successfully initiated the shift with a laser4.",
            "The JILA team looked for the transition frequency in trillions of thorium-229 atoms embedded in a crystal using a system known as a frequency comb. The comb pumps out an array of laser frequency lines, with regular and even spacing. It allows researchers to illuminate the crystal with many precise frequencies simultaneously to look for a match, rather than scanning laboriously through the range of possible options using a single-frequency laser.",
            "The comb\u2019s settings \u2014 including the width of the gaps between the lines, or \u2018teeth\u2019 \u2014 were calibrated using the atomic clock and could be tweaked. The team conducted several experimental runs, and when they observed the tell-tale glow produced as thorium-229 atoms decay from their excited state, they used the settings to calculate the frequency driving the signal.",

This not only allowed the team to determine the absolute frequency value with high precision, but also opened up some cool possibilities in physics, says Zhang.",

The latest result \u2014 which pinpoints the frequency with an accuracy of 13 decimal places \u2014 is already precise enough to narrow down the possible energy ranges in which light dark matter could exist, says Fuchs. Nuclear physics could also benefit from the more precise transition frequency, which could help scientists to distinguish between possible shapes of the thorium-229 nucleus, she adds.",

            "Despite the scale of the problem, there is no Interpol equivalent for journals, nor an official authority to provide industry-wide alerts about suspicious manuscripts. \u201cIt was just a complete lucky break that the person asked to review it was the author,\u201d Rasmussen says. \u201cObviously our system should not depend on that kind of serendipity.\u201d",

            "Although some figures in the BioSystems manuscript were direct copies of those in Payne\u2019s paper, others were simply replotted using his data, which are publicly available, he says. He shared the disconcerting experience on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cWell, it happened,\u201d he wrote. He was reviewing a manuscript, he wrote in a post, that included \u201ca direct copy of the figures\u201d in one of his own papers.",

            "Unlike the figures, the main text of the Proteomics paper is similar to that of Payne\u2019s, but not identical. For example, Payne and his colleagues wrote:",

            "The use of the third person caught Payne\u2019s eye. He says such oddities led him to think his paper had been paraphrased using artificial intelligence (AI) to create believable but different text.",
            "h2Paper pushing",
            "In the course of reporting, Nature found links between authors of the Proteomics paper and a paper mill. Two authors, Dmitrii Babaskin and Tatyana Degtyarevskaya, both at the I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, had separate articles3,4 retracted from the International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning. Both retraction statements, issued in July 2022, use the same language: \u201cThe work could be linked to a criminal paper mill selling authorships and articles for publication.\u201d",
            "As evidence, the statements cited the work of Brian Perron \u2014 who studies social work at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and also works as a misconduct sleuth \u2014 and his colleagues, who had found links between both of the retracted papers and International Publisher. Neither Babaskin nor Degtyarevskaya responded to Nature\u2019s requests for comment about the retractions.",
            "\n\nPublishers unite to tackle doctored images in research papers\n",
            "International Publisher\u2019s website advertises a selection of more than 10,000 manuscripts, on topics as diverse as the metallurgy of aluminium-alloy welding and the biological features of quails. Prospective buyers can see the paper\u2019s title, and sometimes its abstract, as well as the expected ranking in the citation database Scopus of the journal of publication. They then select an author slot, with costs ranging from about US$500 to $3,000. The company promises that titles and abstracts shown online will be \u201ccompletely changed\u201d for publication. \u201cNo one will ever be able to find the manuscript anywhere,\u201d the website declares.",
            "Nevertheless, in 2021, Perron and his colleagues reported on the scientific-fraud watchdog website Retraction Watch that they had identified nearly 200 published papers that probably originated from International Publisher. A number of the published titles \u201cwere almost word-for-word\u201d the same as those listed for sale, Perron says. Many of the papers listed in the Retraction Watch report were later retracted. Asked for comment on allegations that it is a paper mill, International Publisher did not respond.",
            "h2Clearing the catalogue",
            "International Publisher removes paper listings from its online catalogue after papers are purchased. To get around this, Nature examined a database of past International Publisher paper listings, created by Perron, and combed through screenshots of the paper mill\u2019s website taken by the non-profit organization Internet Archive, based in San Francisco, California. The search showed that the titles of multiple articles published by four of the five authors of the Proteomics study matched the titles of papers previously listed for sale by International Publisher.",
            "\n\nBiomedical paper retractions have quadrupled in 20 years \u2014 why?\n",
            "These paper listings do not include the full article text, but strong circumstantial evidence connects the paper mill\u2019s listings to published studies. For example, a screenshot of the paper mill\u2019s website taken in September 2021 shows that among the articles for sale was #1584, \u201cThe structure of forest vegetation on industrial dumps of different ages.\u201d Degtyarevskaya was an author of a paper published in Ecology and Evolution5 in July 2023 with a nearly identical title and matching abstract. In response to an enquiry from the news team, Ecology and Evolution said that it is now investigating the matter.",
            "Although Nature\u2019s news team was unable to locate a sales listing on International Publisher\u2019s website for the Proteomics paper, Perron says that the paper has several hallmarks of paper-mill articles. Nature could not find any other studies published by the authors on the paper\u2019s subject matter, protein analysis. Moreover, the manuscript was submitted to BioSystems while it was still under review at Proteomics. Perron says that submitting a manuscript to more than one journal simultaneously is a classic tactic of researchers trying to publish paper-mill products.",
            "A spokesperson for Wiley did not specify whether the allegedly plagiarized Proteomics paper came from a paper mill, but said: \u201cOur investigation confirmed that systematic manipulation of the publication process was at play.\u201d",

            "In recent years, some publishers and journals have taken extra countermeasures against plagiarism and paper mills. One such effort, developed by the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers (STM), a trade organization in The Hague, the Netherlands, is the STM Integrity Hub, a resource for scientific publishers that includes a \u2018paper mill checker tool\u2019 and \u2018duplicate submission checker tool\u2019. The latter is in use at more than 150 journals and scans more than 20,000 papers each month. More than 1% are identified as duplicates.",
            "There are no metrics for how often researchers spot plagiarism of their own work, but several researchers responded to Payne\u2019s social-media posts by sharing that they had found themselves in a similar situation.",
            "For Payne, the prospect of paper mills taking advantage of AI is a daunting one. \u201cThis, I think, is a pretty good con,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to happen more.\u201d",
