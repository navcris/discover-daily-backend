            "AlphaFold3 is open at last. Six months after Google DeepMind controversially withheld code from a paper describing the protein-structure prediction model, scientists can now download the software code and use the artificial intelligence (AI) tool for non-commercial applications, the London-based company announced on 11 November. ",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to see what people do with this,\u201d says John Jumper, who leads the AlphaFold team at DeepMind and last month, along with CEO Demis Hassabis, won a share of the 2024 Chemistry Nobel Prize for their work on the AI tool.",
            "Major AlphaFold upgrade offers boost for drug discovery",
            "AlphaFold3, unlike its predecessors, is capable of modelling proteins in concert with other molecules. But instead of releasing its underlying code \u2014 as was done with AlphaFold2 \u2014 DeepMind provided access via a web server that restricted the number and types of predictions scientists could make.",
            "Crucially, the AlphaFold3 server prevented scientists from predicting how proteins behave in the presence of potential drugs. But now, DeepMind\u2019s decision to release the code means academic scientists can predict such interactions by running the model themselves.",
            "The company initially said that making AlphaFold3 available only through a web server struck the right balance between enabling access for research and protecting commercial ambitions. Isomorphic Labs, a DeepMind spinoff company in London, is applying AlphaFold3 to drug discovery.",
            "But the publication of AlphaFold3 without its code or model weights \u2014 parameters obtained by training the software on protein structures and other data \u2014 drew criticism from scientists, who said the move undermined reproducibility. DeepMind swiftly reversed course and said it would make an open-source version of the tool available within half a year.",
            "Anyone can now download the AlphaFold3 software code and use it non-commercially. But for now, only scientists with an academic affiliation can access the training weights on request.",
            "h2Accessible versions",
            "DeepMind has got competition: over the past few months, several companies have unveiled open-source protein structure prediction tools based on AlphaFold3, relying on specifications described in the original paper known as pseudocode. ",
            "Two Chinese companies \u2014 technology giant Baidu and TikTok developer ByteDance \u2014 have rolled out their own AlphaFold3 inspired models, as has a start-up in San Francisco, California, called Chai Discovery.",
            "AlphaFold3 \u2014 why did Nature publish it without its code?",
            "A key limitation of these models is that, like AlphaFold3, none is licensed for commercial applications such as drug discovery, says Mohammed AlQuraishi, a computational biologist at Columbia University in New York City. However, Chai Discovery\u2019s model, Chai-1, can be used via a web server for such work, says Jack Dent, a co-founder of the company. ",
            "Another firm, San Francisco-based Ligo Biosciences, has released a restriction-free version of AlphaFold3. But it doesn\u2019t yet have the full suite of capabilities, including the capacity to model drugs and molecules other than proteins.",
            "Other teams are working on versions of AlphaFold3 that don\u2019t come with such limits: AlQuraishi hopes to have a fully open-source model called OpenFold3 available by the end of the year. This would enable drug companies to retrain their own versions of the model using proprietary data, such as the structures of proteins bound to different drugs, potentially improving performance.",
            "h2Openness matters",
            "The last year has seen a flood of new biological AI models released by companies with varying approaches to openness. Anthony Gitter, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, has no problem with for-profit companies joining his field \u2014 so long as they play by the same rules as other scientists when they share their work in journals and preprint servers.",
            "If DeepMind makes claims about AlphaFold3 in a scientific publication, \u201cI and others expect them to also share information about how predictions were made and put the AI models and code out in a way that we can inspect,\u201d Gitter adds. \u201cMy group's not going to build on and use the tools that we can't inspect.\u201d",
            "Not all \u2018open source\u2019 AI models are actually open: here\u2019s a ranking",
            "The fact that several AlphaFold3 replications have already emerged shows that model was reproducible, even without open-source code, says Pushmeet Kohli, DeepMind\u2019s head of AI for science. He adds that in future he would like to see more discussion about the publishing norms in a field increasingly populated by both academic and corporate researchers.",
            "The open-source nature of AlphaFold2 led to a flood of innovation from other scientists. For instance, the winners of a recent protein design contest used the AI tool to design new proteins capable of binding a cancer target. Jumper\u2019s favourite recent AlphaFold2 hack was from a team that used the tool to identify a key protein that helps sperm attach to egg cells. ",
            "Jumper can\u2019t wait for such surprises to emerge after sharing AlphaFold3 \u2014 even if they don\u2019t always bear fruit. \u201cPeople will use it in weird ways,\u201d he predicts. \u201cSometimes it will fail and sometimes it will succeed.\u201d",

            "Beata Halassy discovered in 2020, aged 49, that she had breast cancer at the site of a previous mastectomy. It was the second recurrence there since her left breast had been removed, and she couldn\u2019t face another bout of chemotherapy. ",

            "A case report published in Vaccines in August1 outlines how Halassy self-administered a treatment called oncolytic virotherapy (OVT) to help treat her own stage 3 cancer. She has now been cancer-free for four years. ",
            "In choosing to self-experiment, Halassy joins a long line of scientists who have participated in this under-the-radar, stigmatized and ethically fraught practice. \u201cIt took a brave editor to publish the report,\u201d says Halassy.",
            "h2Up-and-coming therapy",
            "OVT is an emerging field of cancer treatment that uses viruses to both attack cancerous cells and provoke the immune system into fighting them. Most OVT clinical trials so far have been in late-stage, metastatic cancer, but in the past few years they have been directed towards earlier-stage disease. One OVT, called T-VEC, has been in approved in the United States to treat metastatic melanoma, but there are as yet no OVT agents approved to treat breast cancer of any stage, anywhere in the world. ",
            "Halassy stresses that she isn\u2019t a specialist in OVT, but her expertise in cultivating and purifying viruses in the laboratory gave her the confidence to try the treatment. She chose to target her tumour with two different viruses consecutively \u2014 a measles virus followed by a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Both pathogens are known to infect the type of cell from which her tumour originated, and have already been used in OVT clinical trials. A measles virus has been trialled against metastatic breast cancer.",
            "Halassy had previous experience working with both viruses, and both have a good safety record. The strain of measles she chose is used extensively in childhood vaccines, and the strain of VSV induces, at worst, mild influenza-like symptoms. ",

            "Over a two-month period, a colleague administered a regime of treatments with research-grade material freshly prepared by Halassy, injected directly into her tumour. Her oncologists agreed to monitor her during the self-treatment, so that she would be able to switch to conventional chemotherapy if things went wrong.",
            "The approach seemed to be effective: over the course of the treatment, and with no serious side effects, the tumour shrank substantially and became softer. It also detached from the pectoral muscle and skin that it had been invading, making it easy to remove surgically.",
            "How a trove of cancer genomes could improve kids\u2019 leukaemia treatment",
            "Analysis of the tumour after removal showed that it was thoroughly infiltrated with immune cells called lymphocytes, suggesting that the OVT had worked as expected and provoked Halassy\u2019s immune system to attack both the viruses and the tumour cells. \u201cAn immune response was, for sure, elicited,\u201d says Halassy. After the surgery, she received a year\u2019s treatment with the anticancer drug trastuzumab. ",
            "Stephen Russell, an OVT specialist who runs virotherapy biotech company Vyriad in Rochester, Minnesota, agrees that Halassy\u2019s case suggests the viral injections worked to shrink her tumour and cause its invasive edges to recede. ",
            "But he doesn\u2019t think her experience really breaks any new ground, because researchers are already trying to use OVT to help treat earlier-stage cancer. He isn\u2019t aware of anyone trying two viruses sequentially, but says it isn\u2019t possible to deduce whether this mattered in an \u2018n of 1\u2019 study. \u201cReally, the novelty here is, she did it to herself with a virus that she grew in her own lab,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Ethical dilemma",
            "Halassy felt a responsibility to publish her findings. But she received more than a dozen rejections from journals \u2014 mainly, she says, because the paper, co-authored with colleagues, involved self-experimentation. \u201cThe major concern was always ethical issues,\u201d says Halassy. She was particularly determined to persevere after she came across a review highlighting the value of self-experimentation2. ",
            "That journals had concerns doesn\u2019t surprise Jacob Sherkow, a law and medicine researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has examined the ethics of researcher self-experimentation in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. ",
            "Huge leap in breast cancer survival rate",
            "The problem is not that Halassy used self-experimentation as such, but that publishing her results could encourage others to reject conventional treatment and try something similar, says Sherkow. People with cancer can be particularly susceptible to trying unproven treatments. Yet, he notes, it\u2019s also important to ensure that the knowledge that comes from self-experimentation isn\u2019t lost. The paper emphasizes that self-medicating with cancer-fighting viruses \u201cshould not be the first approach\u201d in the case of a cancer diagnosis. ",
            "\u201cI think it ultimately does fall within the line of being ethical, but it isn\u2019t a slam-dunk case,\u201d says Sherkow, adding that he would have liked to see a commentary fleshing out the ethics perspective, published alongside the case report.",
            "Halassy has no regrets about self-treating, or her dogged pursuit of publication. She thinks it is unlikely that someone would try to copy her, because the treatment requires so much scientific knowledge and skill. And the experience has given her own research a new direction: in September she got funding to investigate OVT to treat cancer in domestic animals. \u201cThe focus of my laboratory has completely turned because of the positive experience with my self-treatment,\u201d she says.",

When this essential source of rejuvenation is depleted \u2014 a condition known as limbal stem-cell deficiency (LSCD) \u2014 scar tissue coats the cornea, eventually leading to blindness. It can result from trauma to the eye or from autoimmune or genetic diseases.",
            "Treatments for LSCD are limited. They typically involve transplanting corneal cells derived from stem cells obtained from a person\u2019s healthy eye, which is an invasive procedure with uncertain outcomes. When both eyes are affected, corneal transplants from deceased donors are an option, but these are sometimes rejected by the recipient\u2019s immune system. ",
            "Kohji Nishida, an ophthalmologist at Osaka University in Japan, and his colleagues used an alternative source of cells \u2014 induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells \u2014 to make the corneal transplants. They took blood cells from a healthy donor and reprogrammed them into an embryonic-like state, then transformed them into a thin, transparent sheet of cobblestone-shaped corneal epithelial cells.",
            "Between June 2019 and November 2020, the team enrolled two women and two men aged between 39 and 72 years old with LSCD in both eyes. As part of the surgery, the team scraped off the layer of scar tissue covering the damaged cornea in only one eye, then stitched on epithelial sheets derived from a donor and placed a soft protective contact lens on top.",
            "h2Vision test",
            "Two years after receiving the transplants, none of the recipients had experienced severe side effects. The grafts did not form tumours \u2014 a known risk of growing iPS cells \u2014 and did not show clear signs of being attacked by the recipients\u2019 immune systems, even in two patients who did not receive immunosuppressant drugs. \u201cIt is important and a relief to see grafts were not rejected,\u201d says Bharti. But more transplants are needed to be certain of the intervention\u2019s safety, he says.",
            "After the transplants, all four recipients showed immediate improvements in their vision, and a reduction in the area of the cornea affected by LSCD. The improvements persisted in all but one recipient, who showed slight reversals during a one-year observation period.",
            "Bharti says it isn\u2019t clear what exactly caused the vision improvements. It\u2019s possible that the transplanted cells themselves proliferated in the recipient\u2019s corneas. But the vision gains could also be due to the removal of scar tissue before the transplant, or the transplant triggering the recipient\u2019s own cells to migrate from other regions of the eye and rejuvenate the cornea. ",
            "Nishida says they plan to launch clinical trials in March to assess the treatment\u2019s efficacy. Several other iPS-cell-based trials are under way globally to treat eye diseases, says Bharti. \u201cThese success stories suggest we are headed in the right direction.\u201d",

            "This instinctive reflex is shared by many furry mammals including mice, cats, squirrels, lions, tigers and bears. The move helps animals to remove water, insects or other irritants from hard-to-reach places. But underlying the shakes is a complex \u2014 and previously mysterious \u2014 neurological mechanism.",
            "Now, researchers have identified the neural circuit that triggers characteristic \u2018wet dog\u2019 shaking behaviour in mice \u2014 which involves a specific class of touch receptors, and neurons that connect the spinal cord to the brain. Their findings were published in Science on 7 November1.",
            "\u201cThe touch system is so complex and rich that [it] can distinguish a water droplet from a crawling insect from the gentle touch of a loved one,\u201d says Kara Marshall, a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s really remarkable to be able to link a very specific subset of touch receptors to this familiar and understandable behaviour.\u201d",

Study co-author Dawei Zhang, a neuroscientist then at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and his colleagues focused on a type of ultra-sensitive touch detecting receptors called C-fibre low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs), which wrap around hair follicles.",
            "Dogs might have evolved to read your emotions",
            "In humans, these receptors are associated with pleasant touch sensations, such as a soft hug or a soothing stroke. But in mice and other animals, they serve a protective role: alerting them to the presence of something on their skin, whether it\u2019s water, dirt or a parasite. When these stimuli cause hairs on the skin to bend it activates the C-LTMRs, says Marshall, \u201cextending the sensibility of the skin beyond just the surface\u201d.",
            "To get laboratory mice to shake their fur like wet dogs, the researchers applied drops of sunflower oil to the backs of the mice\u2019s necks. Nearly all the animals shook off these drops within ten seconds. The team then genetically modified some of the mice to remove most of their C-LTMRs. These animals showed a 50% reduction in shakes when oil droplets landed on their neck, compared with unmodified control mice.",
            "The researchers also wanted to explore how signals from C-LTMRs travel through the nervous system to orchestrate the wet dog shakes. They traced the pathway to a group of neurons in the spinal cord; this connects to an area in the brain called the parabrachial nucleus, which is involved in processing pain, temperature and touch.",
            "Using optogenetics, a technique that engineers neurons so that they can be switched on and off in response to light, the researchers blocked the activity of the spinal neurons. These mice showed a 58% reduction in shakes compared with control mice. Blocking activity in the parabrachial nucleus produced similar results. The mice still scratched, groomed and moved normally, suggesting that the neural circuit is specific to wet dog shakes.",
            "h2Specialized circuit",
            "The discovery opens up avenues for future research. \u201cThe wet dog shake is a very coordinated motor response,\u201d says Thomas Kn\u00f6pfel, a neuroscientist at Hong Kong Baptist University in Kowloon Tong, who adds that the study is a good starting point to study how the brain sends commands to control the movement. \u201cWet dog shake is triggered in many animals by psychedelic drugs,\u201d he says. The response to psychedelics involves serotonin receptors, which also play a part in pleasurable touch. \u201cThat gives inspiration for some more work connecting the dots.\u201d",
            "Zhang says that future research could also investigate whether overactive C-LTMRs contribute to conditions such as twitch-skin syndrome in cats, which involves sudden rippling of the skin and excessive twitching, or to other kinds of skin hypersensitivity in humans. ",

Besides Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the results of any election he doesn\u2019t win and his promises to use the powers of the federal government for political retribution, researchers fear that he just might succeed in reshaping the US government by replacing thousands of federal scientists with obedient political appointees.

And although total CO2 emissions increased from 10.7 to 15.6 million tonnes, average emissions per kilometre decreased, which could be due to more efficient jet systems (see \u2018The jet set\u2019).",

For example, 172 of the 595 private planes that flew to the 2023 World Economic Forum were also seen at the Cannes Film Festival that year.

            "Controversy has erupted among researchers over an effort to adopt blood tests and brain scans for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rather than the cognitive screening that has been used for decades.",
            "Proponents of the change say that new biomarker tests can detect Alzheimer\u2019s at a very early stage \u2014 the best time to apply any treatments that are developed to reverse the disease. But critics say that, although the effort is well-intentioned, it means that people can be diagnosed with a single test, even if they have no symptoms of cognitive decline \u2014 and might never develop them.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of misunderstanding and distress that individuals who are asymptomatic will have if we tell them they have Alzheimer\u2019s, whereas nothing will happen in their lifetime in a majority of cases,\u201d says Nicolas Villain, a neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, who co-wrote a paper1 published on 1 November in JAMA Neurology criticizing the new diagnostic criteria.",
            "h2Plaques and tangles",
            "The brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s have two key features: plaques of sticky amyloid-\u03b2 proteins and tangles formed from tau proteins. The neurodegeneration linked with the development of these plaques and tangles is irreversible, so researchers have been searching for treatments to give to healthy people to ward off this damage entirely.",
            "In the past few years, companies have started marketing drugs that slow Alzheimer\u2019s-related cognitive decline by clearing amyloid from the brain, and scientists have been perfecting highly accurate tests for both amyloid and tau protein.",
            "Researchers call for a major rethink of how Alzheimer\u2019s treatments are evaluated",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s this confluence of the possibility of widespread clinically available, accurate diagnosis with the ability to do something about the disease that prompted us to update the criteria,\u201d says Clifford Jack, a specialist in clinical Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia research at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who co-led the effort to revise the diagnosis criteria. Jack and his colleagues in a working group for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, a non-profit research and advocacy organization in Chicago, Illinois, published their guidelines2 in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia in June.",
            "The criteria say that any one abnormal result on a core set of biomarker-based tests is sufficient to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s. These tests include measurements of amyloid and tau-protein levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and a positron-emission tomography (PET) brain scan, which helps to quantify amyloid plaques.",
            "h2Devastating diagnosis",
            "But Villain and his colleagues point out in their critique that a large swathe of people diagnosed in this way would never develop any cognitive symptoms: a 65-year-old man who is amyloid-biomarker positive has a lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s dementia of about 22%, which is only roughly 1.7 times higher than the risk for a similar individual who is amyloid-biomarker negative.",
            "The critics also argue that people who test positive for a single biomarker and are cognitively unimpaired should be informed that they are at risk of the disease but should not be given an official Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. A person without symptoms who either tests positive on multiple biomarker tests or has a gene variant known to significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s dementia could be given a diagnosis of \u2018presymptomatic\u2019 Alzheimer\u2019s, the critics write.",
            "Landmark Alzheimer\u2019s drug approval confounds research community",
            "Jack acknowledges that biomarker testing makes it possible for asymptomatic individuals to be diagnosed with the disease \u2014 but the guidelines state that biologically-based diagnoses are intended to \u201cassist rather than supplant\u201d clinical evaluations. And the working group does not recommend Alzheimer\u2019s biomarker tests for healthy people, so a hypothetical positive diagnosis for someone without symptoms should not come to pass, he says.",
            "However, the new criteria might expand eligibility for clinical trials, which could help to develop treatments for asymptomatic individuals, Jack says. \u201cThe reality is that every person who ultimately becomes demented due to Alzheimer\u2019s went through a period of time when they were asymptomatic with the disease,\u201d he says. \u201cMedicine needs to focus its future on how to prevent the onset of symptoms, because by the time someone becomes symptomatic, extensive irreversible damage has already occurred.\u201d",
            "h2Nothing in the cupboard",
            "But medications for biomarker-positive, asymptomatic people are currently non-existent except in clinical trials, says Andrea Bozoki, a cognitive neurologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill who co-wrote the JAMA Neurology critique. This would leave such people with the mental anguish of having a diagnosis for an incurable disease but lacking treatment options, she says.",
            "The new drugs that that slow the cognitive decline caused by the disease are approved in the United States only for people who are already experiencing mild cognitive impairment.",
            "Bozoki worries that the new criteria will spur healthy people who fear that they are at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s, or who have a family history of the disease, to find a doctor who will order a biomarker test for them. And if they\u2019re diagnosed, she says, they might be prescribed the new Alzheimer\u2019s drugs. These haven\u2019t been shown to be effective in asymptomatic populations, cost tens of thousands of US dollars a year and carry a risk of brain bleeding and fatal seizures.",
            "This will make it even more important for researchers and doctors to ensure that they are properly communicating risk and uncertainty as Alzheimer\u2019s tests and drugs become more available, says Winston Chiong, a neurologist and ethicist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved with either workgroup.",

            "British particle physicist Mark Thomson has been named as the next leader of CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory outside Geneva, Switzerland. ",
            "As CERN\u2019s director-general, Thomson will face major challenges, including an uncertain political landscape amid the war in Ukraine, which has led the lab to break government-level ties with Russia. He will also have to repair a faltering consensus around the Future Circular Collider (FCC), a proposed 90-kilometre tunnel that will host the lab\u2019s flagship experiments throughout the rest of the century. The German government, CERN\u2019s largest financial contributor, expressed scepticism about FCC earlier this year, and China could beat CERN to the punch with a similar project.",
            "CERN\u2019s $17-billion supercollider in question as top funder criticizes cost",
            "Thomson is no stranger to CERN: he worked at a major experiment there in the 1990s, and, together with the current director-general Fabiola Gianotti, helped to discover the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \u2014 the world\u2019s most powerful particle accelerator \u2014 in 2012. He is currently chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a UK funding agency, and is a representative on the CERN Council, the board that oversees the lab on behalf of its member countries. Thomson will take up the director-general post when Gianotti\u2019s second consecutive five-year term ends at the end of 2025. ",
            "In a press conference on 7 November, both Gianotti and Thomson stressed the need for continuity, and the importance of the ongoing upgrade to the 27-kilometre LHC. Thomson also reiterated Gianotti\u2019s commitment to building the FCC. \u201cI am very much aligned with the vision of the current DG,\u201d he told reporters. ",
            "Former CERN council president Ursula Bassler is optimistic about Thomson\u2019s appointment. \u201cHe is a person who values what the FCC can bring to CERN, but who is also aware of the reservations some people might have,\u201d says Bassler, a particle physicist at \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris. \u201cI think he will really act in a quite transparent way to come to a decision.\u201d",
            "Thomson will be the first UK physicist to lead the organization since the 1990s. As well as having worked at the LHC, he has been a co-leader of and spokesperson for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, now under construction in Illinois and South Dakota. ",
