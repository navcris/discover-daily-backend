            "Ever since the first quantum computers were dreamt up in the early 1980s, researchers have looked forward to the day the devices could solve problems that are too difficult for classical computers. In the past five years, the machines have finally begun to challenge their classical cousins \u2014 although definitive victory over them has remained elusive.",
            "Now, in the latest chapter of the battle to achieve this \u2018quantum advantage\u2019, researchers at Google say they have determined the conditions under which quantum computers can beat their classical counterparts. To understand these conditions, they used a quantum-computer processor named Sycamore to run random circuit sampling (RCS), a simple quantum algorithm that essentially generates a random sequence of values.",
            "\n\nGoogle\u2019s quantum computer hits key milestone by reducing errors\n",
            "The team analysed Sycamore\u2019s output and found that when it ran in a mode with a lot of noise interference while performing RCS, it could be \u2018spoofed\u2019, or beaten, by classical supercomputers. But, when the noise was lowered to a certain threshold, Sycamore\u2019s computation became complex enough that spoofing it was effectively impossible \u2014 by some estimates, it would take the fastest classical supercomputer in the world ten trillion years. The finding, first reported in a preprint on the arXiv server last year, was published today in Nature1.",
            "This is a convincing demonstration that Sycamore is capable of outpacing any classical computer running RCS, quantum specialists told Nature. In 2019, Google reported that its quantum computer could run RCS and achieve a quantum advantage, but since then classical computers have been able to run the algorithm more quickly than estimated, eliminating the purported advantage. This time around, \u201cGoogle did a very good job of both clarifying and addressing many of the known issues with RCS,\u201d says Michael Foss-Feig, a quantum-computing researcher at the computer software firm Quantinuum, who is based in Broomfield, Colorado. And the new findings show how much noise quantum computers can have and still beat classical computers, he says.",
            "The continuous competition between classical and quantum computers has been a driving force in the field, says Chao-Yang Lu, a quantum physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Shanghai. It has motivated researchers to build bigger and higher-quality quantum computers.",
            "Google\u2019s latest result does not mean that quantum computers will replace classical computers. For instance, Sycamore cannot perform typical operations of a regular computer, such as storing photos or sending e-mails. \u201cQuantum computers are not faster \u2014 they\u2019re different,\u201d says Sergio Boixo, the head of Google\u2019s quantum computing effort in Santa Barbara, California. They are intended to eventually do classically impossible \u2014 and useful \u2014 tasks, such as exactly simulating chemical reactions.",

            "The Sycamore processor looks similar to the silicon chips that power everyday laptops, but it is specially fabricated to control the electrons that flow through it \u2014 with quantum precision. To reduce temperature fluctuations that would destroy the electrons\u2019 delicate states and introduce noise, the chip is kept at ultracold temperatures near absolute zero.",
            "\n\nIBM quantum computer passes calculation milestone\n",
            "Rather than using classical bits (which are always either a 0 or 1) as a regular computer does, the quantum chip relies on qubits, which harness the electrons\u2019 ability to be in a mixture of states. A quantum computer can conduct some tasks with exponentially fewer qubits than the bits a classical computer would need. For example, to run the RCS algorithm, a classical computer would need 1,024 bits and a quantum computer would need 10 qubits.",
            "Five years ago, a team of Google researchers reported in Nature2 that to match a 200-second RCS run on their 53-qubit computer, it would take a classical supercomputer 10,000 years. Almost immediately, the claim came under fire; researchers at the technology giant IBM posted a preprint online3, ahead of peer review, which suggested that a supercomputer could actually complete the task in days. In June, Lu and his colleagues used powerful classical computers to spoof the result in just over one minute4.",
            "Google\u2019s 2019 result is not the only one that has fallen to classical spoofing. In June 2023, IBM researchers and others reported evidence5 that their 127-qubit computer could solve potentially useful maths problems that were \u201cbeyond brute-force classical computation\u201d. Within weeks, multiple studies6,7 showed that classical approaches could still compete.",
            "h2High fidelity",
            "Boixo and his colleagues wanted to understand how noise made quantum computers vulnerable to classical spoofing. They found that even tiny differences in qubit noise \u2014 going from a 99.4% error-free rate to 99.7% \u2014 caused Sycamore to behave as if it were in a new state, similar to matter transitioning from solid to liquid.",
            "\n\nHello quantum world! Google publishes landmark quantum supremacy claim\n",
            "\u201cWhat [the noise] is doing, it\u2019s turning the system into something more classical,\u201d Boixo says. Once an upgraded version of Sycamore running with 67 qubits was past a certain noise threshold, its RCS output became impossible to simulate classically.",
            "Within the past two years, attempts to beat classical supercomputers have also focused on reducing qubit noise. Foss-Feig and his colleagues ran RCS on a quantum computer with 56 low-error qubits8. With better qubits, \u201cat least for RCS, classical computers can no longer keep up with quantum computers\u201d, he says.",
            "Someday, researchers hope quantum computers will be large enough and free enough from errors to move past the quantum\u2013classical war. For now, they\u2019ll settle for the battle. If you cannot win an advantage with RCS, the simplest of applications, Boixo says, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can win in any other application\u201d.",

            "To learn more about how such diets work, the researchers monitored the health and longevity of 960 mice, each a genetically distinct individual drawn from a diverse population that mirrors the genetic variability found in humans. Some mice were placed on calorie-limited diets, another group followed intermittent fasting regimens, and others were allowed to eat freely.",

            "Cutting calories by 40% yielded the longest longevity bump, but intermittent fasting and less severe calorie restriction also increased average lifespan. The dieting mice also displayed favourable metabolic changes, such as reductions in body fat and blood sugar levels.",
            "However, the effects of dietary restriction on metabolism and lifespan didn\u2019t always change in lockstep. To the authors\u2019 surprise, the mice that lost the most weight on a calorie-limited diet tended to die younger than did animals that lost relatively modest amounts.",
            "This suggests that processes beyond simple metabolic regulation drive how the body responds to limited-calorie regimes. What mattered most for lengthening lifespan were traits related to immune health and red-blood-cell function. Also key was overall resilience, presumably encoded in the animals\u2019 genes, to the stress of reduced food intake.",

This year\u2019s laureates \u201chave cracked the code\u201d, he added. The three winners share a prize pot of 11 million Swedish kronor (US$1 million).",

But it was the second iteration of the deep-learning neural network, revealed in late 2020, that really shook up the life sciences. Many of AlphaFold2\u2019s predictions at CASP were so accurate as to be indistinguishable from experimentally solved protein structures.",
            "Hassabis, DeepMind\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, and Jumper, head of the AlphaFold team, led the development of AlphaFold2. To predict protein structures, the neural network incorporates data from libraries of hundreds of thousands of structures and millions of sequences from related proteins \u2014 which hold information about their shapes.",
            "\n\nHow to win a Nobel prize: what kind of scientist scoops medals?\n",

Each data point is years of effort from someone,\u201d Jumper said at the DeepMind press briefing.",
            "In 2021, DeepMind made AlphaFold2\u2019s underlying code freely available, along with the data needed to train the model. An AlphaFold database, created with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory\u2019s European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, now holds the structures of almost all the proteins from every organism represented in genetic databases, some 214 million predictions in total. This year, the company unveiled a third version of AlphaFold, which can model other molecules that interact with proteins such as drugs.",
            "The revolution that Jumper, Hassabis and their colleagues unleashed is still in its early days, and AlphaFold\u2019s full impact on science might not be known for years. Already, the tool is helping scientists make new insights.",
            "One pioneering team used the tool, along with experimental data, to map the nuclear pore complex, one of our cells\u2019 largest machines that transports molecules into and out of the nucleus.

Scientists laying the groundwork for new vaccines are finding AlphaFold incredibly useful and, in some cases, game changing. But AlphaFold is a complement to experimental studies and other approaches to mapping and tweaking the structure of viral proteins for use in vaccines.",
            "For most researchers, a predicted structure is the beginning of a study, not the end, says Jan Kosinski, a structural modeller at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Hamburg, Germany. \u201cAt the beginning, there was this fear that it will replace structural biology, people will lose jobs and so on. Actually, the complete opposite has happened,\u201d he adds.",

            "h2Creating new proteins",
            "More than two decades before DeepMind started working on AlphaFold, computational biophysicist David Baker and his colleagues developed a software tool called Rosetta that modelled protein structures using physical principles. The tool compares small fragments of multiple existing protein structures and sequences to identify a protein sequence that can fold into a particular shape.",
            "Initially, Rosetta was applied to predicting protein structures \u2014 it has been among the top entries at numerous CASPs, prior to AlphaFold\u2019s dominance. But Baker soon realised that the model could be flipped around to design entirely new proteins.",

The first version of the resulting RoseTTAFold network performed nearly as well as AlphaFold2. Since 2021, both networks have been continually improved by their developers and other scientists to tackle fresh challenges, such as predicting the structure of complexes of multiple different interacting proteins.",
            "In recent years, Baker\u2019s team have been especially prolific in applying machine learning to his lab\u2019s raison d\u2019etre: creating new proteins never seen before in nature.

It used to take Rosetta weeks of running on hundreds of processors to come up with a protein design, a task that newer AI-based tools can accomplish in seconds. \u201cNow everybody in the world can do protein design,\u201d he says.",
            "\u201cI have been really deeply inspired by the others in the field and the people I\u2019ve worked with,\u201d said Baker, speaking by telephone at the Nobel prize announcement. \u201cI stood on the shoulders of giants.\u201d",

Studies in mice with lung cancer showed that administering a molecule similar to miR-34 early in the disease could slow tumours4. But at the time, researchers knew little about how to cloak RNA medicines to keep them from provoking a dangerous immune response, or how best to deliver them to the right spot in the human body.",

Those drugs, designed to treat conditions such as high cholesterol, rely on a technique called RNA interference to reduce the activity of a targeted gene. One difference between them and microRNAs, however, is that microRNAs are made naturally by the body and often affect the activity of many genes, Khvorova adds.

            "Zoologist Yolarnie Amepou heard whispers about the fish frenzy when she made her first trip to the Kikori River Delta in the remote reaches of southern Papua New Guinea.",
            "It was January 2012, and Amepou was travelling down the delta by dinghy, from village to village, as part of a research project on the vulnerable pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta). Amepou heard talk of outsiders appearing across the region offering staggering amounts of cash for swim bladders \u2014 an organ cut from some of the delta\u2019s large fish species that helps them to control buoyancy. Consumers in Asia, particularly southern China, know this commodity as fish maw and covet it as a culinary delicacy, a traditional medicine and a symbol of prosperity.",
            "The global maw trade has been growing rapidly over the past 25 years1, and market prices now far exceed those of similar dried seafood luxuries such as shark fin and sea cucumber, which are also prized in China. In some low- and middle-income countries where demand for maw is very high, it is sometimes called the cocaine of the seas because it is so lucrative and attracts organized crime interests.",
            "Papua New Guinea has become the source of some of the most sought-after maw. In the years since Amepou\u2019s first visit, she\u2019s watched the fish-maw industry in the Kikori delta explode, \u201clike a fisheries gold rush\u201d. Fishers replaced their paddle canoes, lines and hooks with outboard-powered dinghies and commercial nets. The price being offered to delta fishers for dried maw from one prized species \u2014 the scaly croaker (Nibea squamosa) \u2014 has been recorded at up to US$15,615 per kilogram \u2014 potentially the highest price offered to fishers for maw in the world, according to a study by Amepou and her colleagues published earlier this year2.",

            "Revenue from the maw industry is a lifesaver for many delta communities, with some people using it to move away from the coast to escape rapidly rising seas. \u201cFish maw has alleviated some quite severe poverty issues,\u201d says Michael Grant, a marine biologist at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, who researches Papua New Guinea\u2019s sharks and rays in the Kikori delta, one of their last strongholds. Its waterways and mangroves are recognized as a sanctuary of biodiversity and have been nominated for inclusion as a World Heritage Site on the list maintained by the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO.",
            "Grant and others fear that the sharp increase in fishing pressure in the Kikori delta and the use of gillnets \u2014 which indiscriminately capture many types of fish, dolphin and turtle \u2014 could recreate problems that have plagued Mexico, China and parts of Africa, where the maw trade has fished some species into near oblivion. That threat risks damaging the delta\u2019s ecosystems and leaving people worse off, says Grant.",
            "The information coming out of Papua New Guinea \u201cis worrying, because it does seem to fit what we\u2019ve seen in other places wherelittle-known species are targeted for the value of their maw\u201d, says Yvonne Sadovy, a Hong Kong fisheries specialist now based in the United Kingdom. Along with Grant and other members of a species-survival commission that is part of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), she contributed to a paper sounding the alarm on the increasing maw trade that was submitted by the United States to a meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in July.",
            "\u201cThere are very few controls and there is very little knowledge, I think, by the government fishery departments about the value, importance and potential threats of this,\u201d says Sadovy. The consequence is \u201ca sort of cowboy frontier\u201d, whereby high prices push fishers to target species that \u201cwe hardly know anything about in terms of the science\u201d.",

            "Amepou wasn\u2019t too concerned when she first heard about the fish-maw trade. In her early years in the Kikori region, she was focused on how hunting and habitat changes were threatening the pig-nosed turtle. The work took her to far-flung villages to monitor nesting sites, survey the consumption of turtle meat and eggs, and build community awareness about the vulnerability of the creatures known as piku.",
            "By 2019 she was known locally as mama piku, and was the director of a small conservation organization, the Piku Biodiversity Network, which she still runs. Amid the other changes in the region, the fish-maw trade had become yet another threat to the turtle\u2019s survival because the animals were getting tangled in commercial gillnets that seafood companies were supplying to local fishers.",

            "The remoteness and logistical difficulties of working in the Kikori delta \u2014 a region with little electrical power, few roads, fragmentary communications and 4\u20138 metres of rainfall a year \u2014 mean that Amepou, Grant and their collaborators are among just a handful of researchers who are active in the area. With support from the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), a multinational organization focused on the region\u2019s natural resources, they collected data on targeted maw species, as well as by-catch. A survey of landings in gillnets reported by fishers from five delta communities over six months to April 2022 found that the hunt for fish maw pulls up huge numbers of non-target fish and mammals3.",
            "Elasmobranchs \u2014 a subclass of fish that includes sharks and rays \u2014 accounted for almost half the catch, whereas target species made up just 22%. Among the other casualties were several species listed as endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, including three species of hammerhead shark, the giant guitarfish (Glaucostegus typus) and the bottlenose wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae), alongside various vulnerable river sharks and critically endangered Indo-Pacific sawfishes (Pristidae)2.",
            "Other reports, some unpublished, document declines in two endemic dolphin species that have small local populations and are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. On one occasion, fishers reported that ten dolphins drowned in a single net, says Amepou. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the very real possibility of a local extinction if nothing is done about the gillnets in the water,\u201d she says.",
            "But discussions with local people about curtailing fishing practices for conservation purposes are acutely sensitive given the money flowing into the economically disadvantaged region. \u201cWhile local fishers acknowledge sustainability concerns, the overarching feeling is everyone is pretty happy for now,\u201d says Grant. \u201cWhether fish-maw money is going back into community and development remains to be seen, and this is our next research focus.\u201d",
            "In 2022, the researchers submitted a report to SPREP on the Kikori maw fishery, urging the development of a management plan3. Sources have told Nature that work on a plan has commenced, but Papua New Guinea\u2019s authorities did not respond to questions from Nature on its progress. In 2021, the National Fisheries Authority stopped issuing new fish-maw licences in Gulf Province, where the Kikori delta is located, and in the neighbouring Western Province, owing to increasing illegal, unregulated and unreported activities in the two fisheries.",
            "h2Villages at risk",
            "After storm surges destroyed many houses in the delta village of Veraibari in 2020, the people formed a relocation committee. They plan to use the windfall maw money to build around 200 homes, a school, a market and churches a short distance inland from the beach where they currently live. The committee estimates that this plan will cost 1,689,000 Papua New Guinean kina (US$431,000). In recent years, waves have damaged and closed the schoolhouse, knocked down freshwater tanks and submerged burial grounds. Abandoned homes decay on their stilts in the shallows alongside the stumps of drowned palm trees.",
            "\u201cThe land is disappearing, the high land is going down, and then it is very easy for water to enter into the village,\u201d says community and church leader Ara Kouwo. When the big tides come, his family wades into the sea to push away debris that might tip their home off its legs.",
            "Kouwo is also the local agent buying maw for one of the six seafood companies, all Asian-led, with licences in Gulf Province. He conducts business at his family table, weighing and trading fish maw, offering 5,000 to 6,000 kina per 100 grams for the finest specimens. He kicked off the relocation fund with his own earnings, urging his neighbours and relatives to provide cash or other contributions. They are lobbying for more government support, but have so far received only sandbags to build a seawall, which soon failed, and some iron roofing, nails and a sawmill to help with the relocation. Money earned from fishing is the only way to save the village, he says, although he recognizes the risks.",
            "If there was any other help coming to pay for the new village, \u201cthen we would stop these fishing activities\u201d, he says. \u201cWe are in fear,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhen we kill all mothers of the fish, we are in trouble.\u201d",

            "The maw trade generates a boom-and-bust cycle that fisheries researchers and activists have seen before. The most infamous case is that of the totoaba (Totoaba macdonaldi), which is found only in Mexico\u2019s Gulf of California and was hunted for its maw for much of the twentieth century.",
            "Although Mexico banned fishing for totoaba in 1975, the species continues to be fished illegally, with trading of totoaba maw increasing on Facebook and the Chinese social media platform WeChat, according to a report released in February by the Environmental Investigation Agency UK, a non-governmental organization in London (see go.nature.com/4ghoiwr). The gillnets used to catch totoaba also entangle the endemic vaquita (Phocoena sinus), the world\u2019s smallest porpoise. It\u2019s estimated that as few as ten individuals remain.",
            "The hunt for maw has left a trail of ecological damage elsewhere, too, including in Africa\u2019s Lake Victoria, where there are concerns that the Nile perch (Lates niloticus) might disappear.",

            "For years, the global scale of fish-maw operations remained mainly under the radar because the volume of the catch was hidden in a broad commodities category of \u201cdried fish\u201d, says Sadovy. She and others urged authorities in Hong Kong, the global trade hub for maw, to introduce a specific code for fish maw separate from other dried fish, which they did in 2015. Data collected using this new code revealed that between 2015 and 2018, 3,144\u20133,882 tonnes of dried maw, worth $264 million to $394 million, were imported to Hong Kong every year4. These were shockingly high numbers, Sadovy says, \u201cbecause you might have 3,000 tonnes of maw, but maw is only 5% of the weight of the animal. So that\u2019s tonnes and tonnes of animal, so you begin to think about the scale of those fisheries\u201d.",

Today it is so rare that \u201cit is possible it will become the first marine commercial species to go extinct in recent times in the wild\u201d, Sadovy says.",

Concern over the trade has grown in the years since then. In 2021, in response to the high prices being paid for maw in Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh, India and French Guiana, the IUCN adopted a motion urging nations to control and monitor trade in the swim bladders of a group of ray-finned fishes known as big croakers to both protect the target species and reduce by-catch of threatened marine megafauna.",

However, she adds that there are also a lot of places where the maw trade operates out of sight.

Their discoveries \u201cform the building blocks of machine learning, that can aid humans in making faster and more-reliable decisions\u201d, said Nobel physics committee chair Ellen Moons, a physicist at Karlstad University, Sweden, during the prize announcement. \u201cArtificial neural networks have been used to advance research across physics topics as diverse as particle physics, material science and astrophysics.\u201d",
            "h2Machine memory",
            "In 1982, Hopfield, a theoretical biologist with a background in physics, came up with a network that described connections between virtual neurons as physical forces1. By storing patterns as a low-energy state of the network, the system was able to re-create these patterns when prompted with something similar. It became known as associative memory, because the way in which it \u2018recalls\u2019 things is similar to the brain trying to remember a word or concept on the basis of related information.",
            "Hinton, a computer scientist, used principles from statistical physics, which collectively describes systems that have too many parts to track individually, to further develop the \u2018Hopfield network\u2019. By building probabilities into a layered version of the network, he created a tool that could recognize and classify images, or generate new examples of the type that it was trained on2.",

But they proved useful and have been built on widely. Neural networks that mimic human learning form the basis of many state-of-the-art AI tools, from large language models to machine-learning algorithms capable of analysing large swathes of data, including the protein-structure-prediction model AlphaFold.",

He added that advances in machine learning \u201cwill have a huge influence, it will be comparable with the industrial revolution. But instead of exceeding people in physical strength, it\u2019s going to exceed people in intellectual ability\u201d.",
            "In recent years, Hinton has become of the loudest voices calling for safeguards to be placed around AI. He says he became convinced last year that digital computation had become better than the human brain, thanks to its ability to share learning from multiple copies of an algorithm, running in parallel. \u201cIt made me think [that these systems are] going to become more intelligent than us sooner than I thought,\u201d he said on 31 May, speaking virtually to the AI for Good Global Summit in Geneva, Switzerland. \u201cUp until that point, I\u2019d spent 50 years thinking that if we could only make it more like the brain, it will be better.\u201d",

Versions of Hopfield\u2019s network models have been useful to neuroscientists, she says, for investigating how neurons work together in memory and navigation.

            "Marburg virus is a \u201ccousin\u201d to Ebola virus, which killed more than 11,000 people during an outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016, says virologist Adam Hume at Boston University in Massachusetts. The death rate from Marburg has ranged from 23% to roughly 90% in past outbreaks. There are no vaccines or treatments, but supportive care increases a person\u2019s odds of survival.",
            "Early Marburg symptoms \u2014 high fever, headache and malaise \u2014 are similar to those of many other diseases. But people with Marburg soon develop severe diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The worst afflicted bleed from their noses, gums or other areas.",
            "\n\nAfter the genocide: what scientists are learning from Rwanda\n",
            "In Rwanda, some of the first people later found to be infected with Marburg initially tested positive for malaria. Health-care workers knew something was amiss when the usual treatment wasn\u2019t working. By the time the workers realized they had a Marburg outbreak on their hands, a number of them had already become infected, Rwandan Minister of Health Sabin Nsanzimana said in a press conference last week.",
            "The outbreak is weighing on the minds of Kigali residents, says Olivier Uwishema, Rwandan-born founder of Oli Health Magazine Organization, a non-profit group in KIgali. Uwishema lives in the United States but happened to be visiting Kigali when Marburg hit. Now when someone gets a fever, \u201cthey mostly think that it may be Marburg\u201d, Uwishema says.",
            "h2Stopping the spread",
            "The good news is that Marburg is transmitted mostly through contact with bodily fluids. That means that isolating infected people and using protective equipment can deter spread effectively, Levine says.",
            "For the next three weeks, contact tracers in Rwanda will be checking in with hundreds of people who were in direct or indirect contact with individuals with Marburg. Health-care workers are testing everyone who presents with a high fever for the disease. This has put a strain on the country\u2019s diagnostic laboratories, given the prevalence of malaria.",
            "Rwanda\u2019s widespread testing for the virus might account for the current outbreak\u2019s large size. Many past outbreaks were reported to have affected only a few people, Uwishema says. But cases might have been missed in countries whose health-care systems are not strong enough to offer the level of testing that Rwanda has achieved.",
            "The outbreak can be declared over if no new infections arise for 42 days \u2014 equivalent to two incubation periods for the virus \u2014 after the last case is identified. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we should have a good sense about whether it is rapidly growing or rather petering out,\u201d Levine says.",
            "h2Vaccine testing underway",
            "Marburg outbreaks usually start after a person encounters an infected fruit bat \u2014 an animal that can carry the virus without getting sick. Because of forces such as climate change and deforestation, \u201cboundaries between the wildlife and the humans are breaking down\u201d, creating ever more frequent opportunities for pathogens to jump to people, said global-health expert Caroline Ryan at Ireland\u2019s Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Celbridge.",
            "\n\nMeet the Ebola workers battling a virus in a war zone\n",
            "Vaccines and drugs could help to curb Marburg, but to test these tools thoroughly, scientists must wait for outbreaks to happen. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons why, I think, we don\u2019t have therapeutics and vaccines that are approved against Marburg virus,\u201d Hume says.",
            "Rwandan doctors have started testing a candidate Marburg vaccine, and plan to test the efficacy of the antiviral drug remdesivir against the disease. Animal trials1 suggest that remdesivir might be helpful for treating Marburg, as it is for COVID-19. But data from human trials investigating remdesivir as an Ebola therapy \u201cwere a little disappointing\u201d, Hume says, raising the prospect that the drug won\u2019t be useful for Marburg either.",
            "However, the identification of effective antiviral will not be enough, health officials say. To weather future outbreaks, Africa must build its capacity to manufacture vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tools on its own, said Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, last week. Relying on other countries to sell such supplies at high prices can lead to \u201cpanic mode\u201d, he said.",

            "Put aside the hype about the growing number of us who are likely to make it to 100, because the rise in human life expectancy might actually be slowing down. At least, according to a study that analysed mortality data for ten countries or regions over the past three decades1.",
            "\u201cThere are limits to how far out we can push out the envelope of human survival,\u201d says study co-author S. Jay Olshansky, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. \u201cIf you live long enough, you run up against the biological process of ageing.\u201d",
            "The era of what he calls radical life extension is over, he argues. Some researchers, however, disagree and point out that medical science could yet find a way to push age limits.",
            "Advances in public health and medicine during the twentieth century increased human life expectancy to about three years per decade. But Olshansky and others have long argued that this rate of improvement is not sustainable, despite more-optimistic forecasts that predict most children born in the twenty-first century would live for a 100 years or more2. But this is difficult to confirm, because the only way to be sure is to wait for enough people to die, or not.",
            "With his colleagues, Olshansky first published the idea3 that human life expectancy has a finite limit in 1990. \u201cWe have waited 30 years to test this,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we now have definitive evidence that the limited lifespan hypothesis is correct.\u201d",
            "That evidence is based on the numbers of reported deaths in parts of the world with some of the highest current life expectancies, including Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Australia, France, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, the United States and Spain. The analysis looked at the period of 1990 to 2019, to avoid the distorting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
            "The team found that the rate of improvement in life expectancy in the decade of 2010\u201319 had dropped below that seen between 1990 and 2000. People were still living longer, but not by as much. In fact, in every population except those of Hong Kong and South Korea, the decadal rise in life expectancy decelerated to below two years.",
            "Overall, the study found that children born since 2010 have a relatively small chance of living to 100 (5.1% chance for women and 1.8% chance for men). The most likely cohort to see a full century are women in Hong Kong, with a 12.8% chance.",
            "h2Can we overcome ageing?",
            "It\u2019s clear that further extension of the average lifespan is difficult because that would require researchers to find treatments for illnesses that affect older people, says Dmitri Jdanov, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany. Jdanov wrote, together with his colleague Domantas Jasilionis, an accompanying commentary on the paper. Both articles are published in Nature Aging today.",
            "But Jdanov thinks that Olshansky is too pessimistic about possible progress. \u201cAlthough making another leap might be difficult, the rapid development of new technologies may lead to an unexpected health revolution,\u201d he says.",
            "A century ago, few researchers would have thought that child mortality could be reduced considerably, he says. But advances in vaccines, education and public health have since slashed the rate from more than 20% in 1950 to less than 4% now.",
            "\u201cIf we cannot imagine something, it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s impossible,\u201d Jdanov says.",
            "The study also revealed what Olshansky calls a \u201cshocking\u201d decline in the average life expectancy in the United States in the decade starting in 2010 \u2014 a trend seen in such a long-lived population only after extreme events, such as war, since 1900. The decline in the United States is driven by increasing numbers of deaths because of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease in people aged roughly 40 to 60.",
            "\u201cIt tells you that something pretty negative is happening among some subgroups of the population to drag the average down, because the wealthier, more highly educated subgroups are actually doing better,\u201d Olshansky says.",

But they finally have a new tool to help: vaccines, which were previously unavailable in Africa despite mpox first being detected on the continent decades ago.",
            "Mpox vaccines, which have been used in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States, did not materialize in Africa during earlier outbreaks, even the global one in 2022, says Nicaise Ndembi, a virologist at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) in Addis Ababa. This year, however, countries have pledged doses, and the jabs have begun to arrive, after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public-health emergency for the second time in history.",
            "On 17 September, Rwandan health officials began administering jabs to those at high risk of infection; the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has been the country hit hardest by the disease, will follow suit on 5 October; and Nigeria is set to start its own vaccinations in the next two weeks.",

            "These developments come as African countries report more than 31,400 suspected mpox infections and 844 deaths in 2024. Clade Ib, a new strain of the virus that causes mpox, has also spread in densely populated regions; some transmission is occurring through sexual contact, allowing the virus to spread between people efficiently.",
            "It isn\u2019t yet known how effective the vaccines will be against clade I virus \u2014 they helped during the global outbreak two years ago, but that crisis was driven by a different strain, called clade IIb. Still, many scientists emphasize that the jabs are safe and expected to work.",
            "Here, Ndembi, who is coordinating the Africa CDC\u2019s mpox response, discusses how health officials are planning to distribute the doses and the challenges they will face.",
            "h2Is the number of doses that you\u2019re receiving what you would have expected from an equitable global response during the 2022 global outbreak?",
            "We are doing much better. There are about 275,000 doses that we currently have on hand, and they have already been dispatched to countries for administering. In the 2022 pandemic, we didn\u2019t get a single dose of vaccine.",
            "If you put together the pledges and what\u2019s already been delivered, there are about 6.1 million doses coming. But you can\u2019t vaccinate with pledges: the 10,000 doses that Nigeria received in 2024 were actually pledged in 2022. So you can see the disparities. But to now have 6.1 million doses pledged is incredible. Now, we need to see them materialize.",
            "We\u2019re looking at vaccinating 10 million people [in Africa], but that number might need to be as high as 14 or 15 million.",
            "h2Until more doses arrive, how will countries prioritize who gets jabs first?",
            "This is not a vaccination campaign. The messaging around the word \u2018campaign\u2019 connotes that everyone can get a shot. But we\u2019re going to be very targeted. We\u2019re hoping to reach specific groups, and we are envisaging that this approach could create problems within the community if we don\u2019t communicate properly who is most at risk of infection and why we\u2019re prioritizing certain groups. We see that many people are waiting for the vaccine \u2014 it\u2019s a silver bullet to many. The stigma coming with mpox [which causes visible, fluid-filled lesions, among other symptoms] means everyone wants to get vaccinated.",
            "As an example of prioritizing specific groups, Rwanda has started vaccination, and it\u2019s very targeted among female sex workers and among cross-border traders, truck drivers and health-care workers \u2014 all of whom are at high risk [of infection]. We will also use a \u2018ring vaccination\u2019 approach: we will identify close contacts of infected people, and those are who you\u2019d want to be sure to vaccinate first.",
            "h2The DRC is contending with outbreaks of several strains \u2014 clade Ib, as well as clade Ia, which typically has spread to people through infected animals. Will that affect how vaccines are distributed?",
            "We will start with the hotspots: the provinces that are most affected are going to be selected in the first bloc, and then subsequently we will move on to other areas.",
            "For the different subtypes of the virus, I want to be very clear: viruses don\u2019t have boundaries. We have to move away from the idea that we could confine an [mpox] subtype in a geographic area. [The city] Kinshasa has both clade Ia and Ib.",
            "We\u2019re not going to say, \u2018Let\u2019s start vaccinating the clade Ib areas and then go to the Ia areas.\u2019 That would be too complex.",
            "h2You mentioned Kinshasa, where both clade I strains are spreading. How concerning is this?",
            "Kinshasa is the entry and exit point for almost all travellers [coming through the region]. There\u2019s definitely worry, because infections there can easily be transported anywhere in the world.",
            "h2How will you monitor the effectiveness of the vaccines as people receive them?",
            "We have a team already in Rwanda that is working to ensure that we monitor for adverse events and that, over time, those vaccines are effective. They will study the immunogenicity, safety and effectiveness, as well as durability [how long the vaccine\u2019s effects last].",
            "[Editor\u2019s note: one clinical trial aims to recruit more than 1,500 people over the age of ten in the DRC, Uganda and Nigeria with confirmed mpox infections, to understand whether the vaccines can reduce the risk of participants\u2019 contacts developing the disease or lessen the severity of their illness.]",
            "h2What would success look like?",
            "In the DRC, we\u2019re dealing with a country of 100 million people. We\u2019re talking about over 30,000 suspected cases \u2014 and consider, how many people are even able to get tested? Currently, about 40% of suspected cases get tested, and about 60% of those are positive. That means we\u2019re not testing a lot, and we still have people out there that are moving with the virus, who don\u2019t even know they\u2019re infected.",
            "You are controlling an epidemic when new cases stop coming from the contacts of those who you know are infected. Vaccines are meant to help break those chains of transmission \u2014 so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be looking for.",
            "But vaccination is just one of the tools in the response: risk communication, community engagement, laboratory [infrastructure] are equally important.",
            "h2What has been most difficult about controlling this outbreak?",
            "First, mpox is endemic in some parts of Africa. Within the DRC, there are provinces that have been reporting cases for decades. We don\u2019t have enough tools to rapidly detect the virus. For HIV, you have five minutes, you get the test done, and the result is 99% accurate. If we had a test [similar to the one for HIV], that would be fantastic.",
            "The other challenge is drugs. Tecovirimat [an antiviral against mpox] worked for clade II during the 2022 pandemic, but it has been shown to be less effective on the African population in the DRC. And lastly, we haven\u2019t had enough vaccines. This is a very strong case for local manufacturing across the continent: we need to start making the diagnostic kits, the drugs and even the vaccines here.",

            "For one, Australia is geographically isolated and doesn\u2019t import live poultry, says Frank Wong, a virologist at the CSIRO Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong. Many of the countries\u2019 birds are endemic and do not migrate to regions where the virus is spreading.",
            "But the virus\u2019s arrival in Australia is \u201ca matter of when, not if\u201d, says Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne, Australia.",
            "h2Bird survey",
            "Wille thinks that long-distance migratory shorebirds and seabirds that come from Siberia and Alaska through southeast Asia to Australia are most likely to carry the virus into the country.",
            "This week, Australian scientists, including Wille, started swabbing the first of nearly 1,000 migratory birds for the virus. Over the coming weeks, the team will capture wedge-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica) and short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) as they migrate from the northern autumn to the southern spring. At night, shearwaters sleep in burrows and are relatively easy to grab. The researchers will swab the birds for the virus, and take blood to test for antibodies that will reveal previous exposure. They will be testing for the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in particular, which has caused mass mortality in birds and some mammals.",
            "To swab the birds, the researchers will travel to seven locations across Australia, as far apart as Broome in the northwest, Lord Howe Island in the east and Phillip Island in the south.",
            "h2Deadly ducks?",
            "Wille says another possible route for the virus is through ducks. Scientists think migrating ducks and geese in other parts of the world can spread the disease without succumbing to it.",
            "That\u2019s because ducks\u2019 epithelial cells have a sensor, known as RIG-I, that detects an invading influenza virus and triggers an immune response that usually fends it off. Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, says ducks might have evolved such defences in Asia from repeated infections with many less-pathogenic forms of the virus, giving them pre-existing immunity. Although they don\u2019t get sick from H5N1, they can still pass it on, and ducks congregate in lakes and ponds with other birds, increasing the chances of disease spread.",
            "h2Isolated ecosystems",
            "Another reason that Oceania is currently free of the virus is that the region\u2019s ducks are endemic and they don\u2019t tend to migrate overseas.",
            "This isolation is partly explained by a biogeographical division called the Wallace Line, first described by naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859, which runs through Indonesia. Many animal species tend to stay on one side of the line or the other, and because of this isolation, the fauna on each side are distinct. Michael Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, describes this phenomenon as \u201cone of the great mysteries\u201d of the world.",
            "The sharp division might also mean that the virus is not adapted to animals east of the Wallace Line, says Wong. \u201cAvian influenza viruses, including this high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus, are particularly well-adapted to certain species,\u201d he says. Birds in Australia could have a genetic make-up that circumvents the usual infection route for the virus, but no one has yet tested this hypothesis.",
            "Although many duck species are short-distance migratory birds and tend not to cross the Wallace Line, some species \u2014 including Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa) and spotted whistling duck (Dendrocygna guttata) \u2014 do, and Wille thinks they could introduce H5N1 to the region.",
            "If the virus is detected, government veterinarians will immediately move in to cull the affected population, which happened when H7N3 and H7N9 strains of the flu were detected in Victoria in May.",
            "Short says that, when it happens, the effect on Australia\u2019s birds, mammals and ecosystems is unknown, but many species are probably susceptible. \u201cIt\u2019s a big research gap,\u201d she says.",

            "However, there were some negative trends. Researchers who had completed several postdoc positions were the least likely to receive an offer. Older applicants, first-generation scholars (those whose parents didn\u2019t go to university) and applicants who were residents of countries outside North America were also less likely to find success.",
            "Jadavji says the apparent advantage for women is somewhat unexpected, given the gender imbalance at higher levels of academia and the \u201cleaky pipeline\u2019 that continues to remove women from the academic career path. \u201cWe know that women are taken out of the job market at every level of science training,\u201d she says.",
            "The finding that women in this sample were more likely to receive job offers than were men was \u201cpleasant to see\u201d, says Yvette Pearson, a STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education researcher and the former vice-president of diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Texas at Dallas. \u201cIt\u2019s less surprising in the biological sciences, where we see a larger number of women completing undergraduate and graduate degrees. I\u2019d like to see this in engineering, computer science and other STEM disciplines.\u201d",
            "The study found that men and women were equally likely to be offered on-site job interviews, but women were more successful at turning those interviews into offers. That might be partly because men are more likely than women to apply to jobs even if they don\u2019t meet all of the required qualifications, Pearson says. \u201cWomen might go into interviews with a higher level of confidence,\u201d she adds, because, in reality, they have stronger CVs.",
            "Pearson co-authored a 2023 paper2 in the International Journal of STEM Education that looked at the qualifications and characteristics that are deemed important by faculty members and administrators during the hiring process. That study found that qualifications related to research \u2014 including institutional prestige, postdoctoral experience and publications \u2014 were more important when evaluating tenure-track applicants. By contrast, qualifications and qualities related to diversity, equity and inclusion (such as a proven ability to work with people of different genders, races and ethnicities) took on more importance when hiring for non-tenure-track teaching positions.",
            "Michael Yassa, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, says that the bioRxiv study provides an interesting snapshot of a crucial part of the hiring process. He co-authored a 2023 report3 in the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) Journal that detailed successful efforts at his institution to diversify faculty recruitment in the field of biomedical sciences. Among other things, his institution took steps to ensure greater gender balance in hiring committees.",
            "\n\nWhite men still hold majority of US science and engineering jobs\n",
            "Women who do land a faculty job continue to face obstacles in promotion and leadership opportunities, Yassa says. \u201cEven if hiring is equal, every step onwards is disproportionately challenging for women and under-represented minorities.\"",
            "In the bioRxiv study, the race and ethnicity of applicants had no apparent bearing on the chances of receiving a job offer. Jadavji cautioned that only about 10% of respondents identified as Black, Hispanic or members of another under-represented minority.",
            "When it comes to job applications, the more the better, Jadavji says. \u201cThe number of applications you submit plays a major role in the number of offers you receive,\u201d Jadavji says. In this sample, the sheer volume of applications \u2014 ranging from one to 96 per person \u2014 was the most reliable predictor of success.",
            "Pearson says that 96 applications is probably overkill for any particular job search, but she does see a lesson in the findings: applicants shouldn\u2019t skimp on their opportunities. \u201cMy advice is to apply to every position that meets your qualifications and your interests,\u201d she says.",
            "The finding that completing several postdoc positions can lower the chances of a job offer might be unwelcome news for many junior researchers who have spent years trying to land a tenure-track role.",
            "\u201cThe general advice, especially in biomedical sciences, is that you have to do a number of postdocs\u201d to be competitive for a faculty position, Jadavji says. \u201cBut if you stay too long, you may become undesirable.\u201d",
            "Junior researchers who are in their second or third postdoc position shouldn\u2019t necessarily despair, Yassa says. Instead, they should continue to work towards awards, publications and other accomplishments that can reassure hiring committees. \u201cThey need to show that they have the potential to launch a successful research programme,\u201d he says.",
            "Jadavji plans to continue studying job applicants to get a clearer picture of the factors that determine success in academia. Hiring departments are ultimately looking for someone who is a good fit, which is a difficult quality to measure, she says.",
            "\u201cWe've recruited social scientists to our team to start looking at the qualitative experience of being on the faculty job market,\u201d Jadavji adds. \u201cThere are a lot of factors to consider.\u201d",
