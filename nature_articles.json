            "Bits of human bone recovered from Pompeii, Italy, have yielded DNA from people who died during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius \u2014 and the genetic data are challenging old assumptions about the victims\u2019 identities and relationships1.",
            "Researchers obtained the bone fragments from the plaster casts of people who died in the eruption, which buried the city under ash and pumice in ad 79. The DNA is the first to be recovered from the casts and reveals details about the sex, ancestry and family ties of five individuals.",

            "One narrative debunked by the genetic data, published today in Current Biology, centres on a victim long thought to be a mother who died while holding their child. An intricate golden bracelet on one of the their arms contributed to the attribution of female gender to the individual. The DNA analysis showed instead that the individual was a male and had no familial link with the child.",
            "The reversal shows that DNA can \u201crewrite history, or the stories of a particular group of individuals\u201d, says co-author David Caramelli, an anthropologist at the University of Florence in Italy.",

            "h2Moment of death",
            "Since excavations of the ruins of Pompeii began in the 1700s, more than 100 plaster casts of the victims\u2019 bodies have been made by pouring liquid plaster in the voids left by the destruction of their soft tissues. Many of these casts still encase pieces of the victims\u2019 bones.",
            "The researchers had the opportunity to collect some of these fragments during efforts to restore 86 of the 104 plaster casts. Samples from five individuals yielded complete or partial genomes. The researchers were very lucky, Lindo says. \u201cJust being exposed to that type of heat would have destroyed a lot of the DNA, and then being mixed environmentally with the plaster later on would have also complicated the situation.\u201d",

            "According to the DNA analysis, all five individuals were male. The analysis also revealed details of their relationships with each other. For example, the remains of the person wearing the golden bracelet and the child that the person carried were discovered along with two others. Until now, the people in the group were thought to belong to the same family, but the DNA analysis showed no biological connection between them. The findings highlight how unreliable such conventional interpretations, often based on limited evidence, can be, the authors say.",
            "Another interpretation challenged by the new data involves two individuals found in an apparent embrace. They were previously thought to be either sisters or a mother and a daughter, but the genetic analysis now suggests that at least one of them was male.",

            "\u201cWhat this study does is to remind us that there are indeed myths there to be debunked,\u201d says Steven Ellis, an archaeologist at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio, who has led excavations in Pompeii. He notes that most narratives built around the plaster casts are simplified interpretations designed to boost public interest. Current scholarship about Pompeii doesn\u2019t necessarily accept past interpretations of the casts, but \u201cthe plaster casts are an extraordinary symbol of the tragedy that is the story of Pompeii and they\u2019ve always created a splash\u201d, he says. ",
            "The DNA analysis also confirmed that Pompeii\u2019s population was genetically diverse: the analysed individuals were descendants of immigrants from the eastern Mediterranean. \u201cWe\u2019ve known it from the jewelry that they\u2019re wearing, the cults that they follow, the decorations that adorn the houses,\u201d Ellis says. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t really know it from the body cast themselves.

He will also have to repair a faltering consensus around the Future Circular Collider (FCC), a new 90-kilometre tunnel to host the lab\u2019s flagship experiments throughout the rest of the century. The German government, CERN\u2019s largest contributor, expressed scepticism about the project earlier this year, and China could beat CERN to the punch with a similar project.",

He is currently chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a UK funding agency, and is a representative on the CERN Council, the board that oversees the laboratory on behalf of its member countries. He will take up the director general post at the end of 2025, when Gianotti\u2019s second consecutive five-year term is due to end. ",
            "In a press conference on 7 November, both Gianotti and Thomson stressed the need for continuity, and the importance of the ongoing \u20ac1.5 billion upgrade to the 27-kilometre LHC. Thomson also reiterated Gianotti\u2019s commitment to build the FCC. \u201cI am very much aligned with the vision of the current DG,\u201d he told reporters. ",

            "A first-of-its-kind blood test that uses biomarkers to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression could slash the time it takes to get an accurate diagnosis from years to weeks, according to the company that developed the test \u2014 but some scientists have raised concerns about its validity.",
            "The test uses biomarkers related to RNA editing to diagnose the condition and has been available in France since March and in Italy since October 2023, having been granted regulatory approval in both countries.",
            "Blood test uses \u2018protein clock\u2019 to predict risk of Alzheimer\u2019s and other diseases",
            "However, some researchers are concerned about the small size of the trials the test is based on and the lack of independent verification of the studies. The test\u2019s developer, the French start-up Alcediag in Montpellier, says that its trials are valid and reproducible. ",
            "The row highlights a wider discussion about the potential of biomarkers \u2014 biological characteristics that can indicate a particular medical state \u2014 to enable earlier diagnosis and more personalized treatments for psychiatric disorders.",
            "\u201cThere is a role for investigating biomarkers,\u201d says Suresh Sundram, a psychiatrist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cBut it is a very fraught area.\u201d",
            "h2Slow diagnosis",
            "Bipolar disorder, a spectrum of conditions characterized by mood swings that alternate between mania and depression, is difficult to diagnose. About 40 million people globally live with the illness, and the diagnostic process, which often involves multiple sessions with a psychiatrist, takes an average of seven to ten years, during which time people are often misdiagnosed with conditions such as depression and given inappropriate or ineffective treatments.",
            "Alcediag hopes to alter this grim landscape. The company says its \u20ac900 (US$980) blood test, EDIT-B, can help to distinguish bipolar disorder from depression using biomarkers. EDIT-B differentiates between the two by measuring subtle differences in RNA editing \u2014 a regulatory process that alters various cellular mechanisms, including the expression of genes, which in turn affects neurological functioning.",
            "Found: a brain-wiring pattern linked to depression",
            "Several studies have suggested that differences in RNA editing could play a part in autoimmune diseases and cancer, as well as in psychiatric conditions. In preliminary research, scientists at Alcediag identified distinct patterns of RNA editing affecting eight genes that seem to differ between healthy people and those experiencing depression. Among the depressed patients, six of these genes also show variations that distinguish people with depression from those with bipolar disorder. These differences produce a unique combination \u2014 or signature \u2014 of biomarkers that the company says it discovered using an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm it developed.",
            "\u201cWe have a signature for those with depression, a signature for the controls, and \u2026 one for bipolar,\u201d says Dinah Weissmann, co-founder and chief scientific officer of Alcediag. In a 2022 study involving 410 participants, the algorithm distinguished between the 160 people with depression and the 95 individuals with bipolar disorder with high accuracy1.",
            "About 80 people have used EDIT-B since its commercialization in France and Italy, says Weissmann, and feedback has been positive so far. She cites the anecdotal report of a person who, after receiving a positive test result, said they changed to more effective medication. \u201cThe patient wrote to their doctor: \u2018It\u2019s great, I\u2019m back on my feet. I\u2019m living normally again,\u2019\u201d says Weissmann.",
            "h2Potential risks",
            "For many people with bipolar disorder, a faster, more precise diagnosis would allow them to access \u201cthe right medication, at the right time\u201d, says Marion Leboyer, a psychiatrist and executive director of the FondaMental Foundation, a research organisation based near Paris.",
            "On the other hand, if a blood test gives an incorrect result, there is a risk that disorders could be misdiagnosed or overlooked, says Boris Chaumette, a psychiatrist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris. ",
            "There is no indication that an EDIT-B result has led to an incorrect diagnosis. But Chaumette and others are concerned about some of the methodology of studies used to demonstrate the EDIT-B test\u2019s effectiveness. He points to \u201cinherent limits\u201d to the 2022 study with 410 participants. \u201cYou take a data set with many variables and not many patients, and you ask an algorithm to classify people. It will inevitably find things that classify them, it will inevitably identify commonalities,\u201d he says. \u201cIn fact, what you observe could be the effect of treatments.\u201d",
            "Simple blood test detects eight different kinds of cancer",
            "He adds that, apart from the control group, every person involved in Alcediag\u2019s studies was taking medication (as is often the case with psychiatric research). These drugs could affect the levels of some biomarkers, says Sundram, \u201cso the algorithm could pick up the effect of the medicine\u201d.",
            "Weissmann says that the study participants with bipolar disorder and those with depression were taking a range of different medications, so if the algorithm was distinguishing people on the basis of their treatments, it would have classified them according to therapeutic classes. Stable patients \u2014 those who had a diagnosis but were not experiencing symptoms at the time of the study \u2014 also had a different biomarker signature from the control group, she adds, indicating that their medication suppressed symptoms without affecting markers of the underlying illness. She says that Alcediag\u2019s studies have involved hundreds of participants, and that the company is conducting a new clinical trial with 436 patients; they expect to publish the results next year.",
            "h2Replication questions",
            "Certain aspects of Alcediag\u2019s studies make it difficult for independent researchers to verify the work, says Chaumette. The algorithm and its underlying code haven\u2019t been shared, and follow-up studies run after the initial 2022 trial have used slightly different versions of the test. In a study the firm published this year, for example, it had removed one biomarker from the initial combination and added three new ones2.",
            "This issue led the French National Authority for Health (HAS), an independent body that assesses health products, to reject Alcediag\u2019s application for people taking the test to be reimbursed by the French health authorities. \u201cThere were variations in performance among the three versions, and we lacked the rationale to explain why this version was chosen and not another,\u201d says C\u00e9dric Carbonneil, who heads the HAS department responsible for assessing new medical devices and procedures. It is not unusual for companies at early stages of development to initially have their applications denied, and the HAS expects Alcediag to reapply, he adds. Alcediag says that it made changes to the biomarkers to improve the test\u2019s performance, and that it hasn\u2019t shared the algorithm for commercial reasons.",
            "Chaumette says he would have liked to see larger studies backing up the test before it was rolled out to patients, and he hopes Alcediag will make its technology available to independent groups to allow them to replicate the findings. \u201cIf you commercialize it rapidly and patent everything without sharing anything, then it becomes opaque.\u201d",

            "Pain-sensing nerves and immune cells work together to wreak havoc in endometriosis, a painful condition that affects an estimated 190 million women and girls of reproductive age. But a study in mice suggests a way to harness that interaction to treat the disorder1.",
            "The research, which was published on 6 November in Science Translational Medicine, reveals a key molecular pathway that not only promotes the sensation of pain caused by endometriosis, but also exacerbates the disease. Drugs that inhibit this pathway are already used for the treatment of migraines \u2014 the study\u2019s findings suggest that these therapies might be useful to treat endometriosis as well.",
            "\u201cThis is a new way of looking at how we could change pain pathways in endometriosis,\u201d says Louise Hull, a researcher who studies endometriosis and treats people with the condition at the University of Adelaide in Australia.",
            "h2Limited treatments",
            "Endometriosis occurs when cells similar to the lining of the uterus grow outside of the organ, sometimes causing pain, infertility and heavy menstrual bleeding. Current treatment options are limited. Hormonal medications can reduce symptoms in some people but not everyone can tolerate the side effects, and they are not useful for those who want to become pregnant. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used to relieve pain, but long-term use can damage the liver and kidneys. And the benefits of surgical treatments to remove endometrial deposits are often transient.",
            "The condition is also famously understudied, says Michael Rogers, a cancer researcher at the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital in Massachusetts and an author on the study. \u201cCompared to other diseases that are similarly widespread and have a similar economic impact, endometriosis research is at least two \u2014 and probably three \u2014 orders of magnitude underfunded,\u201d he says.",
            "Rogers was recruited to the field by a member of his church whose family has been severely affected by endometriosis. Every month or two, she petitioned him: \u201cShe would say, \u2018Mike, you really need to start working on this disease.\u2019\u201d",
            "Eventually, she won him over. Rogers started following research in the field and, about nine years ago, began to develop the animal models he needed to investigate the condition.",
            "By then, researchers had already discovered that immune cells called macrophages probably contribute to endometriosis and that pain-sensing nerves are also involved2. Rogers and his colleagues found that disabling these nerves in mice with a condition similar to endometriosis not only dampened pain, as assessed by the animals\u2019 behaviour, but also reduced the size of lesions containing endometrial cells. \u201cThis strongly suggested that the pain-sensing nerves weren\u2019t just sensing pain, they were doing something to help the lesions grow,\u201d says study co-author Victor Fattori, a pharmacologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.",
            "h2Crosstalk",
            "The team decided to test whether a protein called CGRP, which aids communication between the nervous system and macrophages, might also have a role in endometriosis. Several drugs that block CGRP have already been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for other conditions, and the researchers administered four of these to mice with an endometriosis-like condition.",
            "Again, they saw a decrease in pain. Two of the drugs significantly reduced lesion size, and it\u2019s possible that higher doses of the other two medicines would have done so as well, says Rogers. ",
            "Clinical trials are needed to determine whether the same approach could be effective in people. Rogers is optimistic that such trials could begin soon: the drugs are already on the market and are considered relatively safe.",
            "Even so, it will be particularly important to demonstrate that they are safe for women who might want to become pregnant while taking the drug, says Hull.",
            "If shown to be safe and effective, CGRP-inhibiting drugs could fill a gap in care for people with endometriosis, says Erin Greaves, who studies the condition at the University of Warwick, UK, and who collaborates with Rogers. \u201cNew non-hormonal treatments for endometriosis are desperately needed.\u201d",

The hope is that the data will aid researchers trying to crack the causes of age-related diseases, particularly conditions that affect the brain, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
            "\u201cTo address challenges in human medicine, we need to draw from a wide range of model systems,\u201d says Christine Charvet, a comparative neuroscientist at Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine in Alabama, who presented the work. \u201cCats, lemurs, mice are all useful. We shouldn\u2019t focus all our efforts on one.\u201d",

            "The Translating Time project started in the 1990s as a tool for developmental biologists1. Project scientists compiled data on how long it takes for the brain to reach a range of developmental milestones in a variety of mammals and used these data to graph the relative development of two species over time. This can help researchers to link observations of animal development to the corresponding human age.",
            "Ageing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline",
            "Over the years, however, as Charvet presented these data at conferences, researchers kept asking her to extend the database to include not only early development, but also how the brain changes as animals age.",
            "Scientists have long been frustrated with the limitations of standard laboratory models when it comes to understanding human ageing and its impact on the unique human brain. Mice live for only a few years \u2014 not long enough to accumulate much of the damage thought to drive some neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Mice might also possess mechanisms that humans lack for clearing clumps of misfolded proteins called plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, says Melissa Edler, a comparative neurobiologist at Kent State University in Ohio.",
            "The evolutionary mismatch between mice and men could be one reason why efforts to develop therapies to treat the disease have often fallen flat, says Elaine Guevara, who studies primate evolutionary genetics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cMice don\u2019t develop the classic hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir brains are quite different to ours.\u201d",

The Dog Aging Project, run by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and Texas A&M University in College Station, tracks tens of thousands of companion dogs to learn more about how their genetics, lifestyle and environment affect ageing.",
            "Does the human lifespan have a limit?",
            "But centuries of breeding have influenced ageing and disease in dogs, says Charvet. Cats often live a bit longer than dogs, she says, and are generally not as highly inbred for specific traits \u2014 some of which also raise disease risk.",
            "So Charvet and her colleagues have been gathering data from veterinary clinics and zoos, and launched an effort called the Catage Project that asks cat owners to submit data about their pets.",
            "So far, they have collected health records and results of blood sample analyses from thousands of felines and taken brain scans of more than 50. Using their own data and the published literature, the team is filling in events along the nonlinear relationship between cat and human ages. A one-year-old cat, for example, is roughly equivalent to an 18-year-old human. But in the next year, a cat ages only about 4 \u2018human years\u2019, to become about as mature as a 22-year-old person.",
            "By the age of 15, a cat is an octogenarian in human years. Some cats experience cognitive decline by then, and the brain scans collected by the team reveal brain volume changes in older cats that mirror those seen in older humans, says Charvet. Previous work has also shown that cats can accumulate plaques and tangles of abnormal proteins similar to those that characterize Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans.",
            "h2Multiple models",
            "Ultimately, researchers might develop a variety of model systems for different aspects of ageing and neurodegeneration, says Edler. Although mice are poor models for some aspects of human ageing, they will still be valuable, because it is so easy for researchers to conduct genetic experiments with the rodents, she says.",
            "Other animals, such as cats or certain nonhuman primates, might be better models for other aspects of brain ageing.

            "This instinctive reflex is shared by many furry mammals including mice, cats, squirrels, lions, tigers and bears. The move helps animals to remove water, insects or other irritants from hard-to-reach places. But underlying the shakes is a complex \u2014 and previously mysterious \u2014 neurological mechanism.",
            "Now, researchers have identified the neural circuit that triggers characteristic \u2018wet dog\u2019 shaking behaviour in mice \u2014 which involves a specific class of touch receptors, and neurons that connect the spinal cord to the brain. Their findings were published in Science on 7 November1.",

But in mice and other animals, they serve a protective role: alerting them to the presence of something on their skin, whether it\u2019s water, dirt or a parasite. When these stimuli cause hairs on the skin to bend it activates the C-LTMRs, says Marshall, \u201cextending the sensibility of the skin beyond just the surface\u201d.",
            "To get laboratory mice to shake their fur like wet dogs, the researchers applied drops of sunflower oil to the backs of the mice\u2019s necks. Nearly all the animals shook off these drops within ten seconds. The team then genetically modified some of the mice to remove most of their C-LTMRs. These animals showed a 50% reduction in shakes when oil droplets landed on their neck, compared with unmodified control mice.",
            "The researchers also wanted to explore how signals from C-LTMRs travel through the nervous system to orchestrate the wet dog shakes. They traced the pathway to a group of neurons in the spinal cord; this connects to an area in the brain called the parabrachial nucleus, which is involved in processing pain, temperature and touch.",
            "Using optogenetics, a technique that engineers neurons so that they can be switched on and off in response to light, the researchers blocked the activity of the spinal neurons. These mice showed a 58% reduction in shakes compared with control mice. Blocking activity in the parabrachial nucleus produced similar results. The mice still scratched, groomed and moved normally, suggesting that the neural circuit is specific to wet dog shakes.",

            "The discovery opens up avenues for future research. \u201cThe wet dog shake is a very coordinated motor response,\u201d says Thomas Kn\u00f6pfel, a neuroscientist at Hong Kong Baptist University in Kowloon Tong, who adds that the study is a good starting point to study how the brain sends commands to control the movement. \u201cWet dog shake is triggered in many animals by psychedelic drugs,\u201d he says. The response to psychedelics involves serotonin receptors, which also play a part in pleasurable touch. \u201cThat gives inspiration for some more work connecting the dots.\u201d",
            "Zhang says that future research could also investigate whether overactive C-LTMRs contribute to conditions such as twitch-skin syndrome in cats, which involves sudden rippling of the skin and excessive twitching, or to other kinds of skin hypersensitivity in humans. ",

            "Carl Laflamme knew what protein he wanted to study, but not where to find it. It is encoded by a gene called C9ORF72, which is mutated in some people with the devastating neurological condition motor neuron disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. And Laflamme wanted to understand its role in the disease.",
            "When he started his postdoctoral fellowship at the Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital in Canada, Laflamme scoured the literature, searching for information on the protein. The problem was that none of the papers seemed to agree where in the cell this mysterious molecule operates. \u201cThere was so much confusion in the field,\u201d Laflamme says.",
            "He wondered whether a reagent was to blame, in particular the antibodies that scientists used to measure the amount of the protein and track its position in the cell. So, he and his colleagues decided to test the antibodies that were available. They identified 16 commercial antibodies that were advertised as able to bind to the protein encoded by C9ORF72. When the researchers put them through their paces, only three performed well \u2014 meaning that the antibodies bound to the protein of interest without binding to other molecules. But not one published study had used these antibodies. About 15 papers described experiments using an antibody that didn\u2019t even bind the key protein in Laflamme\u2019s testing. And those papers had been collectively cited more than 3,000 times1.",
            "Serious errors plague DNA tool that\u2019s a workhorse of biology",
            "Laflamme\u2019s experience isn\u2019t unusual. Scientists have long known that many commercial antibodies don\u2019t work as they should \u2014 they often fail to recognize a specific protein or non-selectively bind to several other targets. The result is a waste of time and resources that some say has contributed to a \u2018reproducibility crisis\u2019 in the biological sciences, potentially slowing the pace of discovery and drug development.",
            "Laflamme is part of a growing community that wants to solve the problem of unreliable antibodies in research. He teamed up with molecular geneticist Aled Edwards at the University of Toronto, Canada, to set up Antibody Characterization through Open Science (YCharOS, pronounced \u2018Icarus\u2019), an initiative that aims to characterize commercially available research antibodies for every human protein.",
            "There are also efforts under way to produce better-performing antibodies, to make it easier for researchers to find them and to encourage the research community to adopt best practices when it comes to choosing and working with these molecules. Antibody vendors, funding agencies and scientific publishers are all getting in on the action, says Harvinder Virk, a physician\u2013scientist at the University of Leicester, UK. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that a problem that has been going on so long will suddenly change \u2014 but I\u2019m hopeful.\u201d",
            "h2Putting antibodies to the test",
            "The immune system produces antibodies in response to foreign substances, such as viruses and bacteria, flagging them for destruction. This makes antibodies useful in laboratory experiments. Scientists co-opt this ability by using them to mark or quantify specific biological molecules, such as a segment of a protein. To be effective, these molecular tags need to have both specificity \u2014 a strong affinity for the target \u2014 and selectivity \u2014 the ability to leave other proteins unmarked.",
            "For decades, scientists created these antibodies themselves. They injected proteins into animals, such as rabbits, whose immune systems would generate antibodies against the foreign molecules. To create a longer-term, more consistent supply of antibodies, researchers extracted immune cells from animals and combined them with immortalized cancer cells. When reagent companies began the mass production of antibodies in the 1990s, most researchers shifted to purchasing antibodies from a catalogue. Today, there are around 7.7 million research antibody products on the market, sold by almost 350 antibody suppliers around the world.",
            "In the late 2000s, scientists began reporting problems with both the specificity and selectivity of many commercially available antibodies, leading researchers to call for an independent body to certify that the molecules work as advertised. Over the years, a handful of groups have launched efforts to evaluate antibodies.",
            "What sets YCharOS apart is the level of cooperation that it has obtained from companies that sell antibodies. When Laflamme and Edwards set out to start YCharOS, they called every single vendor they could find; more than a dozen were interested in collaborating. YCharOS\u2019s industry partners provide the antibodies for testing, free of charge. The partners, along with the funders of the initiative (which include various non-profit organizations and funding agencies), are given the chance to review characterization reports and provide feedback before they are published.",
            "YCharOS tests antibodies by comparing their specificity in a cell line that expresses the target protein at normal biological levels against their performance in what\u2019s called a knock-out cell line that lacks the protein (see \u2018Ways to validate\u2019).",

            "In an analysis published in eLife last year, the YCharOS team used this method to assess 614 commercial antibodies, targeting a total of 65 neuroscience-related proteins2. Two-thirds of them did not work as recommended by manufacturers.",
            "\u201cIt never fails to amaze me how much of a hit or miss antibodies are,\u201d says Riham Ayoubi, director of operations at YCharOS. \u201cIt shows you how important it is to include that negative control in the work.\u201d",
            "Antibody manufacturers reassessed more than half of the underperforming antibodies that YCharOS flagged in 2023. They issued updated recommendations for 153 of them and removed 73 from the market. The YCharOS team has now tested more than 1,000 antibodies that are meant to bind to more than 100 human proteins.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of work ahead,\u201d Laflamme says. He estimates that, of the 1.6 million commercially available antibodies to human proteins, roughly 200,000 are unique (many suppliers sell the same antibodies under different names).",
            "\u201cI think the YCharOS initiative can really make a difference,\u201d says Cecilia Williams, a cancer researcher at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. \u201cBut it\u2019s not everything, because researchers will use these antibodies in other protocols, and in other tissues and cells that may express the protein differently,\u201d she says. The context in which antibodies are used can change how they perform.",
            "Other characterization efforts are trying to tackle this challenge. Andrea Radtke and her collaborators were part of a cell-mapping consortium called the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program when they set up the Organ Mapping Antibody Panels (OMAPs). OMAPs are collections of community-validated antibodies used in multiplex imaging \u2014 a technique that involves visualizing several proteins in a single specimen. Unlike YCharOS, which focuses on conducting rigorous characterizations of antibodies for various applications in one specific context, OMAPs is looking at a single application for the antibodies, but in several contexts, such as in different human tissues and imaging methods. To do so, OMAPs recruits scientists from both academia and industry to conduct validations in their own labs.",
            "\u201cVendors cannot test all possible applications of their antibodies, but as a community we can say \u2018let\u2019s try this\u2019,\u201d says Radtke, who now works as a principal scientist at the instrumentation company Leica Microsystems in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cPeople are testing things that you would never think you could test.\u201d",
            "h2Expanding the toolbox",
            "Even if good antibodies are available, they are not always easy to find. In 2009, Anita Bandrowski, founder and chief executive of the data-sharing platform SciCrunch in San Diego, California, and her colleagues were examining how difficult it was to identify antibodies in journal articles. After sifting through papers in the Journal of Neuroscience, they found that 90% of the antibodies cited lacked a catalogue number (codes used by vendors to label specific products) \u2014 making them almost impossible to track down. To replicate an experiment, it\u2019s important to have the right reagents \u2014 and proper labelling is crucial to finding them, Bandrowski says.",
            "After seeing that a similar problem plagued other journals, Bandrowski and her colleagues decided to create unique, persistent identifiers for antibodies and other scientific resources, such as model organisms, which they called research resource identifiers, or RRIDs. Catalogue numbers can disappear if a company discontinues a product \u2014 and because companies create them independently, two different products might end up with the same one. RRIDs solve this.",
            "\u2018A landmark moment\u2019: scientists use AI to design antibodies from scratch",
            "In 2014, Bandrowski and her team started a pilot project3 with 25 journals, in which they asked authors to include RRIDs in their manuscripts. In the years since, more than 1,000 journals have adopted policies that request these identifiers. \u201cWe currently have nearly one million citations to RRIDs from papers,\u201d says Bandrowski.",
            "Ultimately, the hope is that authors of every journal article will clearly label the resources they used, such as antibodies, with RRIDs, Bandrowski says. \u201cThat won\u2019t change reproducibility by itself, but it is the first step.\u201d",
            "In addition to being able to track down antibodies, researchers need a way to choose which ones to use. In 2012, Andrew Chalmers, who was then a researcher at the University of Bath, UK, co-founded CiteAb, a search engine to help researchers find the most highly cited antibodies. Over the years, the platform has grown to include more than seven million antibodies \u2014 and now also includes, when available, information regarding validations. In May, CiteAb began integrating YCharOS\u2019s characterization data onto its site.",
            "\u201cThe big challenge is that antibodies are just used in so many different ways, for so many different species that you can\u2019t tick off that an antibody is good or bad,\u201d Chalmers says. Many say that knock-out validation is key, but less than 5% of antibodies on CiteAb have been validated in this way, either by suppliers or through other independent initiatives, such as YCharOS. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go,\u201d Chalmers says.",
            "h2Stakeholders get involved",
            "Like many others, Virk developed an interest in antibody reliability after a personal experience with bad antibodies. In 2016, Virk received a big grant to study the role of a protein called TRPA1 in airway inflammation. But one of his colleagues mentioned that, on the basis of his own experience, the antibodies he was working with might not be reliable.",
            "When Virk put TRPA1 antibodies to the test, he discovered that his colleague was right: of the three most-cited antibodies used to study TRPA1, two didn\u2019t detect the human protein at all, and the other detected several other proteins at the same time. \u201cThat was a shock,\u201d Virk says. \u201cAt that point, I wanted to leave science \u2014 because if things are really this unreliable, what\u2019s the point?\u201d",
            "Instead of leaving academia, Virk co-founded the Only Good Antibodies (OGA) community last year, with the aim of bringing together stakeholders \u2014 such as researchers, antibody manufacturers, funding agencies and publishers \u2014 to tackle the problem of poorly performing antibodies. In February, the OGA community hosted its first workshop, which included individuals from these various groups to discuss how to improve the reproducibility of research conducted with antibodies. They were joined by NC3Rs, a scientific organization and funder, based in London that focuses on reducing the use of animals in research. Better antibodies means fewer animals are used in the process of producing these molecules and conducting experiments with them.",
            "Blame it on the antibodies",
            "Currently, the OGA community is working on a project to help researchers choose the right antibodies for their work and to make it easier for them to identify, use and share data about antibody quality. It is also piloting an YCharOS site at the University of Leicester \u2014 the first outside Canada \u2014 which will focus on antibodies used in respiratory sciences. The OGA community is also working with funders and publishers to find ways to reward researchers for adopting antibody-related best practices. Examples of such rewards include grants for scientists taking part in antibody-validation initiatives.",
            "Manufacturers have also been taking steps to improve antibody performance. In addition to increasingly conducting their own knock-out validations, a number of suppliers are also altering the way some of their products are made.",
            "The need to modify antibody-production practices was brought to the fore in 2015, when a group of more than 100 scientists penned a commentary in Nature calling for the community to shift from antibodies generated by immune cells or immune\u2013cancer-cell hybrids, to what are known as recombinant antibodies4. Recombinant antibodies are produced in genetically engineered cells programmed to make a specific antibody. Using these antibodies exclusively, the authors argued, would enable infinite production of antibodies that do not vary from batch to batch \u2014 a key problem with the older methods.",
            "A few manufacturers are shifting towards making more recombinant antibodies. For example, Abcam, an antibody supplier in Cambridge, UK, has added more than 32,000 of them to their portfolio. \u201cFacilitating the move towards recombinants across life-science research is a key part of improving reproducibility,\u201d says Hannah Cable, the vice-president of new product development at Abcam. \u201cThat\u2019s something that antibody suppliers should be doing.\u201d",
            "Rob Meijers, director of the antibody platform at the Institute for Protein Innovation in Boston, Massachusetts, a non-profit research organization that makes recombinant antibodies, says that this shift simply makes more business sense. \u201cThey\u2019re much more reproducible, you can standardize the process for them, and the user feedback is very positive,\u201d he says.",
            "Standardize antibodies used in research",
            "CiteAb\u2019s data have revealed that scientists\u2019 behaviour around antibody use has shifted drastically over the past decade. About 20% of papers from 2023 that involved antibodies used recombinants. \u201cThat\u2019s a big change from where we were ten years ago,\u201d says Chalmers, who is now CiteAb\u2019s chief executive.",
            "Although the ongoing efforts to improve antibody reliability are a move in the right direction, changing scientists\u2019 behaviour remains one of the biggest challenges, say those leading the charge. There are cases in which researchers don\u2019t want to hear that an antibody they\u2019ve been using for their experiments isn\u2019t actually doing what it\u2019s meant to, Williams says. \u201cIf somebody is happy with the result of an antibody, it\u2019s being used regardless, even if it\u2019s certain that it doesn\u2019t bind this protein,\u201d Williams says. Ultimately, she adds, \u201cyou can never get around the fact that the researcher will have to do validations\u201d.",
            "Still, many scientists are hopeful that recent efforts will lead to much needed change. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that things are getting better,\u201d Radtke says. \u201cWhat I\u2019m so encouraged by is the young generation of scientists, who have more of a wolf-pack mentality, and are working together to solve this problem as a community.\u201d",
