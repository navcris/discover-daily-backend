            "On a Saturday morning in mid-August, Alex Naka embarked on what he describes as \u201ca little hackathon\u201d in his girlfriend\u2019s kitchen. Powered by his laptop, some coffee and, at one point, about 80 cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) processors, he generated scores of computer-engineered proteins designed to block a cell receptor that is mutated in some tumours.",
            "Naka \u2014 who on weekdays is a protein engineer at a medical technology company in Alameda, California \u2014 entered his ten most promising creations into a newly launched protein-design competition and watched them climb to the top of the leader board.",
            "\n\nChemistry Nobel goes to developers of AlphaFold AI that predicts protein structures\n",
            "The contest, run by a biotechnology start-up firm called Adaptyv Bio in Lausanne, Switzerland, is one of at least five to have popped up over the past year or so. Most of the people entering the competitions are wielding AI tools such as AlphaFold and chatbot-inspired \u2018protein language models\u2019 that have exploded both in popularity and in power. Three of the researchers behind some of these tools were awarded this year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their efforts. The accolades come, in part, from the hope that newly created proteins could serve as more-effective drugs, industrial enzymes or laboratory reagents.",
            "But the boom in designer proteins has mostly sown confusion, say scientists. People are churning them out faster than they can be made and tested in labs, making it hard to tell which approaches are truly effective.",
            "Contests have driven key scientific advances in the past, particularly for the field of protein-structure prediction. This latest crop of competitions is drawing people from around the world into the related field of protein design by lowering the barrier to entry. It could also quicken the pace of validation and standards development and perhaps help to foster community. \u201cIt will push the field forward and test methods more quickly,\u201d says Noelia Ferruz Capapey, a computational biologist at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain.",
            "But the competitions will have to overcome some hurdles, say scientists, such as identifying which problems to tackle and working out how to select winners objectively. Getting the formula right is important. \u201cThese competitions can do damage\u201d to a field if they are not executed properly, says Burkhard Rost, a computational biologist at the Technical University of Munich in Germany.",
            "h2Competitive by design",
            "The protein-design contests are partly inspired by a 30-year-old competition that helped to kick off the revolution in biological AI. Since 1994, the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) has been challenging scientists to predict the 3D shape of proteins from their amino-acid sequences. Winners of the competition \u2014 founded by computational biologist John Moult at the University of Maryland in Rockville and Krzysztof Fidelis, a computational biologist at the University of California, Davis \u2014 are determined by comparing the computational predictions with unpublished structural models.",
            "In 2018, London-based DeepMind (now Google DeepMind) won CASP with its first version of the protein-structure-prediction tool AlphaFold. Its next iteration, AlphaFold 2, performed so well in 2020 that Moult declared the problem of predicting simple protein structures largely solved. The competition has since shifted its focus to other emerging challenges, such as predicting the structure of multiple interacting proteins in a complex.",
            "\n\nAI tools are designing entirely new proteins that could transform medicine\n",
            "Now, many hope that these competitions can push the protein-design field forwards just as CASP helped to spur a revolution in protein-structure prediction. \u201cThere would have not been an AlphaFold had it not been for CASP,\u201d says Rost. \u201cWe need these competitions to do the job right and motivate people.\u201d",
            "In June, Rost and several of his colleagues won the Protein Engineering Tournament run by Align to Innovate, an international, open-science non-profit organization. The event included two parts. First, participants tried to predict the properties of different enzyme variants. The best-performing teams in this round then re-engineered an enzyme that breaks down starch, with the best designs determined by lab experiments. A 2025 tournament is now in the works.",
            "A Winter Protein Design Games contest that announced its winner in April was run by Liberum Bio, a biotechnology company in Kitchener, Canada, and Rosetta Commons, a collaboration of mostly academic scientists that maintains protein modelling tools. The contest tasked entrants with re-engineering an existing protein \u2014 a plant-virus enzyme used widely in protein purification \u2014 to make the molecule more efficient.",
            "Two other contests asked participants to come up with entirely new proteins. Adaptyv\u2019s was looking for proteins capable of attaching to a growth hormone receptor called EGFR that is overactive in many cancers. The 90 entrants submitted more than 700 designs.",
            "And in Bits to Binders, researchers are vying to create small proteins that could be used in a T-cell cancer therapy. Run by the BioML Society, a graduate-student-led group at the University of Texas at Austin, it attracted 64 teams from 42 countries \u2014 including Nigeria, Colombia, Iran and India. Around 18,000 designs are now being tested, with results due in early 2025. \u201cWe were quite surprised with the turnout,\u201d says co-organizer Clayton Kosonocky, a biochemistry PhD student at the university.",
            "h2Newcomers welcome",
            "Julian Englert, chief executive and co-founder of Adaptyv, says that many of the participants in its contest work in protein engineering and design. However, the competition has also received promising entries from people with no professional experience in biology. An entrant from Iran made his predictions using a gaming computer because he didn\u2019t have access to more-powerful systems.",
            "Englert says that the high-quality entries from people who aren\u2019t established researchers reminds him of the garage-tinkering origins of Apple, Microsoft and other tech giants. \u201cIt would have taken them two years of studying and joining a lab to get to the point where they can get started. Here they can do it over a weekend.\u201d He imagines a future in which freelance protein designers vie for bounties set by companies, academic labs and others seeking a custom molecule.",
            "\n\n\u2018The entire protein universe\u2019: AI predicts shape of nearly every known protein\n",
            "The competitions can save time in other ways, too. Getting quick experimental results from contest organizers was a big motivation for Michael Heinzinger, a machine-learning scientist at the Technical University of Munich who was part of the winning team with Rost. \u201cOtherwise we would have had to put in the time to write a grant,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, the prize is saving time.\u201d",
            "In terms of actual prizes, the Align to Innovate tournament didn\u2019t offer one, but some others do. The winners of Bits to Binders will get a 3D-printed trophy of their design and some merchandise from the biotech company that is conducting the experiments, called LEAH Laboratories in Eagan, Minnesota. There will also be opportunities for collaboration.",
            "Adaptyv, which sells automated lab testing of molecules created by protein designers, offered a handful of free experiments and some of its own swag. And the winners of the Rosetta Winter Games split US$5,000.",
            "But the standout is the recently launched Evolved 2024 contest, in which the first-place team will take home a $25,000 credit for Amazon Web Services, along with credits from other companies (including OpenAI) worth thousands of dollars. Its sponsors include Lux Capital, a venture-capital firm in New York City that has invested more than $1.5 billion in tech firms, and EvolutionaryScale, a biology AI start-up also in New York City, that has attracted $142 million in investment.",
            "h2Beyond big cash prizes",
            "Choosing who will reap these rewards isn\u2019t always straightforward. The Evolved 2024 contest \u2014 more of a hackathon, in which teams work on broad-brush problems such as predicting drug efficacy and safety \u2014 will be judged subjectively by a panel of experts. But even for the contests with more clear-cut protein-design goals, \u201cit\u2019s not trivial to figure out who wins,\u201d says Erika DeBenedictis, a biological engineer and founder of Align to Innovate. Her organization\u2019s tournament gauged designs on the basis of their activity, stability and how well (or even whether) they could be made. \u201cWhen you design a protein, there are a lot of ways it can fail,\u201d she says.",
            "And if competitions are to move the needle in protein design, they will need to address the challenges that the wider field is tackling, say scientists. Unlike structure prediction, protein design can have wildly different criteria from task to task. The approaches to craft a particular type of enzyme might not translate to other proteins, such as vaccine components.",
            "\n\nWhat\u2019s next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution\n",
            "The competitions could prove counterproductive if they send the field down a rabbit hole \u2014 for example, by judging designs too narrowly, warns Rost. Researchers could also fail to reap the full benefits of protein-design competitions if contestants keep quiet about their approaches, says Anthony Gitter, a computational biologist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \u201cIf teams aren\u2019t communicating their methods, there\u2019s not much opportunity to learn about what work and what fails.\u201d",
            "So far, this doesn\u2019t seem to be happening. Most of the competitions encourage or even require participants to describe their approaches. The contests could also help to bring together some of the disparate fields that have been drawn to protein design \u2014 from biochemistry labs that pioneered protein engineering methods to machine-learning scientists who cut their teeth in natural-language processing, says Gitter. \u201cPeople organizing the competitions, to have maximum impact on the field, should think really hard about how to create a community.\u201d",
            "When the Adaptyv competition results were announced in late September, Naka was disappointed. Although all ten of his entries looked strong, none of his designs worked in the lab. Only 5 of the 147 designs that were tested actually bound to the target molecule. And more than 50 of them couldn\u2019t even be made.",
            "That actually isn\u2019t bad: past efforts to design EGFR binders have had much lower success rates. \u201cIt\u2019s par for the course in protein engineering \u2014 you have to be ready to fail a lot,\u201d Naka says. The winners were Martin Pacesa and Lennart Nickel, structural biologists at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) in Lausanne, who posted a preprint describing their approach and made its code open-source (M. Pacesa et al. Preprint at bioRxiv https://doi.org/nmfm; 2024). Adaptyv has now launched a second competition that builds on the first.",
            "Naka wishes he had started working on his entries earlier. He describes his hackathon as \u201ctype 2 fun\u201d \u2014 painful at the time, but enjoyable in retrospect. Through the competition, he forged connections with like-minded scientists, including Gitter. \u201cIt feels like it lowered the barrier to entry and let a lot of new people participate in protein design,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely be participating in similar events in the future.\u201d",

            "h2Bleeding\u2019s heavy toll",
            "Haemorrhage, or uncontrolled bleeding, accounts for about 60,000 deaths in the United States each year1. To try to reduce that number, Huston and his colleagues are developing a treatment that targets the vagus nerves, which are large networks of nerve fibres that link the body with the brain. Despite its name, the treatment does not work like a typical tourniquet that blocks blood flow to injured appendages. Instead, the electrical pulses help to stimulate the spleen, which stores about one-third of the body\u2019s platelets. The stimulation prods the spleen to ready platelets to form a clot.",
            "To test the treatment, the researchers made small cuts in the ears of healthy pigs2. Compared with animals that didn\u2019t receive the treatment, treated swine lost 50% less blood, and the duration of their bleeding was 40% shorter.",
            "The team also tested the treatment on mice with haemophilia, a condition in which the blood does not clot properly, and found similar results3. The experiment also hinted at how nerve stimulation achieves these results: it increases calcium uptake by platelets in the spleen and makes them more ready to release their innards when they reach an injured blood vessel. Both actions are key to clot formation.",
            "h2Promising data",
            "Last year, Huston and Spark Biomedical, a biotechnology firm based in Dallas, Texas, launched a trial of the treatment in 30 people. In some participants, the researchers applied mild electric currents to one of two stimulation sites near the ear; control participants received sham stimulation. The preliminary results show that the treatment modestly increases clot stability and platelet activation.",
            "The treatment\u2019s time scale could be a problem: platelets were most highly activated 2 hours after stimulation \u2014 which might make the device impractical for use in the emergency room. Huston is still analysing data about whether the treatment could lead to excessive clotting elsewhere in the body, but he says that nerve stimulation has been used safely for decades, giving him no reason for concern.",

            "Huston responds that bleeding time and volume are harder to study in people than in animals, because of ethical concerns about intentionally harming humans.

            "It was previously thought that single-cell data sets wouldn\u2019t be as vulnerable to privacy leaks, owing to the level of \u2018noise\u2019, or variation in gene expression, between different cells. But G\u00fcrsoy and her colleagues demonstrated that was not the case.",
            "The team reviewed three publically available single-cell data sets, which included blood cells from people with lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease. The researchers found that they could use data on gene expressionto predict the structure of a person\u2019s genome, by combining these values with information on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The details of eQTLs \u2014 variations on the chromosome that correlate with gene expression \u2014 are also publically available on single-cell data sets.",

            "Unlike the data on gene expression and eQTLs, full-genome databases can usually be accessed only by scientists, to protect donor\u2019s identifying information. But the researchers point out that a participant\u2019s genome data can be publically available elsewhere. For example, they might have uploaded it to a genealogy website in which users send DNA samples to learn more about their ancestry. In this case, an attacker could identify an individual whose cells are in a single-cell data set using their genome. This could reveal personal data related to a sensitive trait such as a psychiatric disorder, given that research participants are often selected to study the biology of these complex conditions.",
            "Privacy breaches like these could have real-world implications, such as causing employment discrimination, says G\u00fcrsoy. She adds that any leaks could even have repercussions for future generations, given that genetic traits can be passed to offspring. \u201cAnything that leaks about us will perpetuate through generations,\u201d she says.",

            "h2Competing interests",
            "Scientists are unsure about how best to tackle these privacy concerns. \u201cThere\u2019s the desire to protect individual privacy, but also the desire to collectively advance medical research, and those are, unfortunately, at odds with each other,\u201d says Mark Gerstein, who researches medical data science at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The simplest solution would be to stop making genetic data so easily accessible, but this would negatively affect research, he says. \u201cWe need to share and aggregate large amounts of information.\u201d he says. \u201cLocking it down and making it more private, really, just gums that whole process up.\u201d",
            "In their study, G\u00fcrsoy and her colleagues say that there should be greater transparency about the risks for participants who share their genomic data, and suggest that researchers should ensure that donors give consent for their data being shared. Another way forward could be encrypting personal data when it is part of a public database. The authors acknowledge that doing this would complicate the process of building and maintaining data sets, but say that it could help to protect participants\u2019 privacy.",

Anne Scheel, a metascientist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, says that although the authors erred, the editors should have noticed the missing preregistration.

            "They developed a model, called LucaProt, using the \u2018transformer\u2019 architecture that underpins ChatGPT, and fed it sequencing and ESMFold protein-prediction data. They then trained their model to recognize viral RdRps and used it to find sequences that encoded these enzymes \u2014 evidence that those sequences belonged to a virus \u2014 in the large tranche of genomic data. Using this method, they identified some 160,000 RNA viruses, including some that were exceptionally long and found in extreme environments such as hot springs, salt lakes and air. Just under half of them had not been described before. They found \u201clittle pockets of RNA virus biodiversity that are really far off in the boonies of evolutionary space\u201d, says Babaian.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a really promising approach for expanding the virosphere,\u201d says Jackie Mahar, an evolutionary virologist at the CSIRO Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong.

            "The team wasn\u2019t able to determine the hosts of the viruses they identified, which should be investigated further, says Mahar.

            "Nobel prize season is always a time of excitement and speculation about potential winners, but it also brings criticism about the constraints imposed by the rules for the world\u2019s most prestigious scientific prizes. Is it, after all, realistic to expect the stipulations specified by Alfred Nobel 129 years ago to remain appropriate for science today?",
            "\n\nAI comes to the Nobels: double win sparks debate about scientific fields\n",
            "Although there is no shortage of scientific prizes, some of which (such as the US$3-million Breakthrough prizes) are more financially rewarding than the Nobels, none is yet afforded the same cultural status and prestige. So, if the Nobels were being launched today, would their formula need to be different?",
            "\u201cPersonally I would say the criteria for Nobel prizes would not have to be significantly modified, but remain effective in the way Alfred Nobel intended,\u201d says chemist Bengt Nord\u00e9n at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, who was chair of the chemistry Nobel Committee for three years.",
            "One obvious question is whether the categories of the awards adequately cover the core of scientific research. The Nobels are assigned loosely to the classical natural-sciences triumvirate of physics, chemistry and biology. But there is clearly some latitude in those boundaries. The physics awards have reached into fields including nonlinear dynamics and astronomy. The chemistry prizes, meanwhile, have ventured into Earth sciences, such as the 1995 prize for work on the ozone layer and atmospheric chemistry. This year\u2019s chemistry and physics prizes both centred on artificial intelligence (AI).",
            "h2Lack of maths",
            "G\u00f6ran Hansson, a physician at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and former vice-chair of the Nobel Foundation, argues that Nobel\u2019s archaic-sounding category of physiology or medicine remains more apt than a broader biology or life sciences, because these awards remain focused on either clinical medicine or biology relevant to humans (including, in 2022, human evolution).",
            "\n\nMedicine Nobel awarded for gene-regulating \u2018microRNAs\u2019\n",
            "Hansson points out that mathematics, which does not have a Nobel category, is well served by other awards, such as the Wolf Prize and the Fields Medal. But there is nothing, he says, to prevent a funder from proposing a new category that could be administered by the Nobel Foundation, as happened for the Nobel prize in economic science \u2014 which is awarded in memory of Alfred Nobel \u2014 launched by Sweden\u2019s central bank Sveriges Riksbank in 1969.",
            "Newer high-profile science prizes fill some of these gaps while leaving others open. For example, the $1-million Kavli prizes were launched in 2005 by the foundation established by entrepreneur Fred Kavli and are administered by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in Oslo. The prizes reward research in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience \u2014 which Kavli thought were \u201cthe most exciting fields for the twenty-first century and beyond\u201d. The Breakthrough prizes, founded by a group of technology entrepreneurs including Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg, give annual awards in fundamental physics, life sciences and mathematics.",
            "Perhaps the biggest source of controversy for the Nobel prizes is the restriction of three winners per category. Some argue that this doesn\u2019t reflect the way science has become highly collaborative since Nobel\u2019s day. But Hansson defends the constraint. \u201cThree is, needless to say, not a holy number. But there has to be a limit. And it forces us to work even harder to identify the true discoverers.\u201d",
            "h2Where does a team end?",
            "Prestigious awards \u201cmake researchers and research visible, shape careers and even create role models\u201d, says historian Nils Hansson at the Heinrich Heine University D\u00fcsseldorf in Germany. He feels such recognition for individual researchers can be positive for science, and doubts that such benefits would follow if prizes were awarded to teams. Besides, he asks, \u201cwhere does an interdisciplinary and international team start and where does it end?\u201d",
            "Nord\u00e9n argues that opening up the prize to big teams \u201cwould dilute the impact\u201d. However, G\u00f6ran Hansson acknowledges that big science, especially particle physics, \u201cis a special case\u201d that complicates the picture. The Breakthrough prizes have no limit on awardees: the 2016 prize in physics for the experimental detection of gravitational waves went to 1,015 recipients.",

            "It would surely be hard for any new prize to compete in prestige with the historical legacy of the Nobels, winners of which include Marie Curie, Albert Einstein, Werner Heisenberg, James Watson, Francis Crick, Frederick Sanger and Sydney Brenner. \u201cThe past laureates chosen can give added prestige to a prize,\u201d says Lise \u00d8vre\u00e5s, president of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, and a microbiologist at the University of Bergen in Norway.",
            "Does the financial worth of a prize make a difference? A small survey of physicians and medical researchers conducted by Nils Hansson1 indicated that scientists feel that media attention can boost an award\u2019s prestige.",
            "Milner says that the substantial financial value of the Breakthrough prizes was intended as \u201ca message to the world: why should basketball players be paid millions and not scientists?\u201d Academic and professional prizes are all well and good, he says, but \u201cwe really want the public at large to understand that scientists should be celebrated on a par with actors and performers and sports people. We wanted to create a celebrity element in science\u201d.",
            "h2Decisions, decisions",
            "Another big talking point is how prize decisions are made. Although the Nobel Committee famously strives to be impervious to lobbying \u2014 G\u00f6ran Hansson argues that the geographical remoteness from \u201cmajor hubs of science\u201d helps the committee to resist such influences \u2014 Nils Hansson says that \u201cmarketing strategies and personal networks\u201d still matter in awards that, unlike in sports, are not decided on the basis of objective criteria2.",
            "\n\nChemistry Nobel goes to developers of AlphaFold AI that predicts protein structures\n",
            "For one thing, women are under-represented among Nobel laureates even after adjusting for gender imbalances in research generally3. Despite this, Hansson\u2019s survey revealed that 41% of those questioned (two-thirds of the survey respondents were male) felt that gender was of no or little influence in the prize decisions, seemingly denying any problem of gender disparity.",
            "Issues of diversity are \u201cconstantly at the centre of attention of the Breakthrough committee members\u201d, says Milner. One of the Breakthrough awards, the Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize (named after the Iranian mathematician and first female to win the Fields medal, who died aged 40 in 2017), is conferred to women for the best doctoral thesis in mathematics.",
            "h2Prize culture",
            "Whether a prize could be rationally designed to optimally reflect merit or acquire prestige remains an open question. Nils Hansson doubts whether enough is known about the sociological factors that govern the procedures for and consequences of awards to make it viable. \u201cThe understanding of prize cultures and their dynamics is still quite superficial,\u201d he says.",
            "\n\nPhysics Nobel scooped by machine-learning pioneers\n",
            "Do the constraints of the Nobels ever frustrate the committee? \u201cYes, of course,\u201d says G\u00f6ran Hansson. \u201cIt is frustrating that we can only award a fraction of all the important discoveries that are made. If we were to set up the Nobel Prize today, we might have chosen slightly different areas, or descriptions of areas.\u201d Another source of dissatisfaction is the extreme secrecy of the deliberations, meaning that \u201cwe have to remain silent when some of our decisions are questioned\u201d. And because that process typically takes a long time, \u201cit can be very sad when a candidate passes away before an award can be made\u201d, he adds.",
            "Still, G\u00f6ran Hansson argues that the Nobel prizes must be getting something right. \u201cHundreds of scientists apparently feel that hundreds of other scientists should be considered for each one of these awards.\u201d And the number of nominations has grown in the past 25 years. \u201cIf the Nobel prize categories were irrelevant in today\u2019s world, wouldn\u2019t one expect the opposite?\u201d",
