            "Intracortical implants help Scott Imbrie to control a robotic arm and hand using his brain. Credit: Taylor Glascock for Nature",
            "Scott Imbrie still remembers the first time that physicians switched on the electrodes sitting on the surface of his brain. He felt a tingling, poking sensation in his hand, like \u201creaching into an evergreen bush\u201d, he says. \u201cIt was like I was decorating a Christmas tree.\u201d",
            "Back in 1985, a car crash shattered three of Imbrie\u2019s vertebrae and severed 70% of his spinal cord, leaving him with very limited sensation or mobility in parts of his body. Now, thanks to an implanted brain\u2013computer interface (BCI), Imbrie can operate a robotic arm, and receive sensory information related to what that arm is doing. Imbrie spends four days a week, three hours at a time, testing, refining and tuning the device with a team of researchers at the University of Chicago in Illinois.",
            "Scientists have been trying to restore mobility for people with missing or paralysed limbs for decades. The aim, historically, was to give people the ability to control prosthetics with commands from the nervous system. But this motor-first approach produced bionic limbs that were much less helpful than hoped: devices were cumbersome and provided only rudimentary control of a hand or leg. What\u2019s more, they just didn\u2019t feel like they were part of the body and required too much concentration to use.",
            "The brain-reading devices helping paralysed people to move, talk and touch",
            "Scientists gradually began to realize that restoring full mobility meant restoring the ability to sense touch and temperature, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. Gaunt says that this realization has led to a revolution in the field.",
            "A landmark study1 came in 2016, when a team led by Gaunt restored tactile sensations in a person with upper-limb paralysis using a computer chip implanted in a region of the brain that controls the hand. Gaunt then teamed up with his Pittsburgh colleague, bioengineer Jennifer Collinger, to integrate a robotic arm with the BCI, allowing the individual to feel and manipulate objects2. \u201cIt meant they could perform motor tasks much faster,\u201d says Collinger. Around the same time, studies in people with limbs that have been amputated showed how restoring tactile inputs into peripheral nerves also drastically improved control of prosthetic hands3.",
            "But researchers haven\u2019t fully cracked the code on how to interpret or create natural sensations that truly benefit people\u2019s lives. Somatosensation \u2014 the collection of senses that interpret touch, temperature, pain and body position \u2014 is dauntingly complex. Imagine trying to encode information that could discern a soft kiss from a painful pinch, or the needles of a pine tree from the bristles of a paintbrush. To create safe and stable interfaces with the brain and body, researchers need to make major advances in engineering as well as in understanding the sensorimotor system, says Rochelle Ackerley, a neuroscientist at Aix-Marseille University in France. And as developers look to increase the size of implanted-device trials, stakeholders have yet to solve ethical issues around the risks of BCIs and high-tech prosthetic devices.",
            "h2A battery to the tongue",
            "Prosthetics developers are beginning to create sensations that feel real and natural, but it\u2019s a work in progress. When Imbrie thinks back to the first tests of his BCI, he says that the sensations were a bit \u201clike holding a battery to the tongue; not painful, but more like electricity\u201d.",
            "One of the first challenges is the plethora of information that needs to be encoded. \u201cWhen we touch an object, different sensory neurons in our skin code its shape, pressure and texture,\u201d says Giacomo Valle, a neuroengineer at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. Valle has been attempting to mimic these neural codes, then deliver them to the brain, either through the body\u2019s sensory nerves or directly to the cortex.",

            "Pedestals on Scott Imbrie\u2019s scalp lead to electrode arrays in motor and sensory areas of his brain.Credit: Taylor Glascock for Nature",
            "Valle worked with Imbrie during his postdoc in the laboratory of Sliman Bensmaia who was at the University of Chicago, drawing knowledge from decades of animal research about how to create different types of tactile sensation. He learnt that tweaking the parameters of electrical impulses creates very specific sensations of textures, pressures and stroking directions. When constructed together, these impulses form sensations of objects. Valle and his colleagues\u2019 latest study4 shows just how far this approach has come. Through the electrodes in Imbrie\u2019s brain, physicians were able to create the sensation of touching the edge of a shape or feeling the motion of an object dragged across Imbrie\u2019s fingertips. Imbrie remembers the vivid feeling when Valle drew certain letters on the interface for Imbrie to interpret. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh my, Giacomo, you just drew an O on my fingertip\u2019, and I could see the grin coming from his face,\u201d says Imbrie.",
            "The principle is exactly the same in people who have had an amputation, but technically more straightforward because tactile signals can be routed into residual nerves in the part of a person\u2019s limb that remains. This technique is allowing individuals to better manipulate and detect objects with bionic hands, or have better balance and gait with bionic legs.",
            "h2Vision without colour",
            "Going beyond tactile inputs, researchers including neuroengineer Solaiman Shokur at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) are beginning to bring back other aspects of somatosensation, such as discerning temperature. Shokur thinks that restoring multisensory inputs will return all the warmth and feeling that somatosensation gives us. \u201cTouch without temperature is like vision without colour,\u201d he says.",
            "Shokur has created warm and cool sensations in the \u2018phantom\u2019 hands of people with an upper-limb amputation by stimulating nerves in their remaining limb with a thermal device5. These stimulations triggered very real and natural thermal sensations that people interpreted as coming from their missing hand.",
            "By chance, one of the participants in Shokur\u2019s trial had also participated in Valle\u2019s trials recreating touch sensations. \u201cHer first reaction with thermal sensation was, \u2018Wow! This was what was missing the whole time\u2019,\u201d says Shokur.",
            "h2Embodied prosthetics",
            "Hugh Herr, an engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge is not convinced that restoring every facet of somatosensation, such as cooling or warmth, is the most important goal for helping people. Herr says that the priority should be restoring those sensory inputs that most improve mobility and function. Above all, he says, it\u2019s important to have prosthetic limbs that feel to users like they\u2019re part of their body, and not just bionic, artificial attachments \u2014 a sensation known as embodiment. \u201cWhen amputees experience natural sensations from their prosthesis as if it was their own limb, and when people can think and move their prosthesis with little error, it gives them a sense of ownership and agency,\u201d says Herr.",
            "He is acutely aware of how painful poorly designed prosthetics can be: both his legs were amputated after a rock-climbing accident, and he has spent 30 years researching ways to build functional prostheses.",
            "Herr says that the current revolution in this field stems from successes in integrating sensory components into prostheses. Designers are merging multiple tissues of the body \u2014 muscle, tendon, bone and nerves \u2014 with synthetic technologies to drive human\u2013machine integration to the next level. Herr\u2019s research team is focusing on surgical techniques and implants that improve on the electrodes used in current bionic-limb systems, which either penetrate the peripheral nerves or wrap around them. \u201cWe\u2019re reimagining how limbs should be amputated and bionic limbs constructed,\u201d he says.",

            "Imbrie\u2019s implants allow him to manipulate objects but also provide tactile feedback.Credit: Taylor Glascock for Nature",
            "Herr\u2019s group, along with collaborators such as Matthew Carty at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, have developed a method of restoring sensory inputs by regrowing nerves in the residual part of an amputated leg, sometimes referred to as the stump. The idea is to make the stump sense when a prosthetic limb hits the ground while walking, but have the sensation felt in the phantom foot rather than in the stump. The approach involved taking parts of the person\u2019s heel skin and surgically attaching them to intact sensory nerves in the stump. The skin graft is connected to a muscle\u2013computer interface, which contracts the muscle to mechanically activate the sensory nerve. \u201cWhen that muscle fires and applies a strain on the skin, the person feels heel strike,\u201d says Herr. Initially developed in rats, the method is now being tested in a clinical trial. It\u2019s early days, but unpublished data suggest that people can feel toe movements and heel pressures. Herr is now testing how this affects bionic-limb embodiment and motor capabilities.",
            "In a publication in July6, Herr and his colleagues demonstrated a similar approach that aims to reproduce the sense of limb positioning, known as proprioception. It had \u201cremarkable\u201d results on bionic legs, restoring almost all mobility, he says. \u201cIf we restored just 18% of total proprioception into the nerve, patients could run up and down steps without a handrail,\u201d says Herr. However, the BCI didn\u2019t restore naturalistic sensations \u2014 individuals didn\u2019t consciously feel the proprioceptive inputs.",
            "How a revolutionary technique got people with spinal-cord injuries back on their feet",
            "Gaunt says that Herr\u2019s system is an impressive demonstration of how restoring proprioception can improve overall function of prosthetic limbs. The benefit, he says, is that the improvement comes through surgery combined with non-invasive neural prosthetics, but he questions how scalable the approach is.",
            "Studies are also showing a somewhat unexpected outcome of creating more embodied prosthetic limbs \u2014 alleviating phantom-limb pain3. This pain, which feels like it comes from the part of the limb that is missing, is a major issue for many people with amputated limbs. \u201cPeripheral-nerve stimulation can decrease phantom-limb pain by recovering lost or erroneous signals at the site,\u201d Ackerley says. It\u2019s becoming clearer, she adds, that bionic devices that stimulate peripheral nerves can also improve affective and social touch, increase comfort and reconnection with a missing limb and prevent \u2018telescoping\u2019, which is the feeling of a phantom limb \u2018shrinking\u2019 into the stump. \u201cEmbodiment and pain are major issues that bionic devices can tackle, providing ways to make prosthetic limbs useful on a more psychological level,\u201d Ackerley says.",
            "h2E-skins",
            "Integrating sensory inputs into a prosthetic limb, either through BCIs or by connecting with peripheral nerves, goes a long way towards replacing a lost arm or leg, but creating a realistic limb, complete with simulated skin, is what many consider the ideal. Zhenan Bao, an engineer at Stanford University in California, talks of the mark that science-fiction films, such as those in the Star Wars franchise, have left on the field. Luke Skywalker\u2019s bionic hand in Return of the Jedi (1983) still serves as the \u201cmoonshot idea\u201d of a bionic limb gloved in synthetic skin, she says. Electronic skins, or e-skins, pull together advances in neuroscience and engineering and could open up the capabilities of prostheses. Although first developed in the 1970s, the field entered a new phase with e-skins when Bao showcased7 a high-tech example in 2023.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re starting to create artificial materials that look and feel like skin. They\u2019re capable not only of sensing information from the environment but can also generate signals to directly communicate with the nervous system to create natural sensations,\u201d says Bao.",
            "The brain-reading devices helping paralysed people to move, talk and touch",
            "A handful of labs are working on improving the capabilities of various integral components of e-skin, including environmental sensors, microcircuits that convert the sensory signals into digital outputs and electrical interfaces to connect the sensors with peripheral nerves. Nitish Thakor, a neuroengineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who works on e-skins, says that progress has only been possible because of breakthroughs in two major domains. First, in nanomaterials and electronics, through \u201cmaking flexible and organic transistors that act like a touch receptor in the skin\u201d, and can self-heal when damaged8. Second, in neuroscience, by converting sensory information into digital data \u201cas spikes that can be used to stimulate the nervous system\u201d, he says.",
            "Bao is most excited about the idea of using e-skins to \u201cgo beyond human capabilities\u201d. One of the studies she was involved in showed an e-skin that is so tightly packed with mechanical sensors that it can read entire words in Braille, instead of one letter at a time9. \u201cYou can also imagine other sensors allowing us to know things like the chemical contents of objects,\u201d says Bao.",
            "Thakor highlights one glaring issue with e-skins, however: none has yet been trialled in humans or integrated into prosthetics. Bao says that she aims to test commercially produced e-skins in people fitted with prostheses in the next two years.",
            "h2Challenges ahead",
            "Although developments in BCIs, neuroprostheses and e-skins have been remarkable, the field is a long way from using them to improve people\u2019s daily lives. Individuals who benefit from these technologies only do so as part of clinical trials, often with intensive, expensive in-lab testing schedules. It\u2019s not yet clear how or when they could take their devices home without the need of scientists \u201ctwiddling knobs\u201d, says Gaunt.",
            "A major problem that researchers are trying to solve is neural interfacing. Currently, scientists can create precisely localized sensations only by stimulating the somatosensory cortex, not through peripheral nerves. But they are testing a number of techniques, such as optogenetics \u2014 a way to control the activity of specific sets of neurons with light, and high-resolution electrodes to selectively stimulate individual nerve fibres. Bao, for one, is working on these approaches, but says that they\u2019re still early in development.",
            "Abandoned: the human cost of neurotechnology failure",
            "Outside the lab, the most pressing issues for individuals relates to ethical and access concerns, says Jennifer French, executive director of Neurotech Network, a patient advocacy and support organization in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re at a pivotal point of moving towards clinical trials, testing these devices in larger groups of patients, but there are many questions around understanding the spectrum of risks versus benefits,\u201d she says. French listed many complex ethical questions, such as what are the clinical pathways for being fitted with devices? What should the clinical trial endpoints be? And how will health services make decisions about whether to pay for such devices?",
            "Another concern is what happens when devices fail, or the makers of a device go bankrupt and the person is left with unsupported or non-working implants. \u201cThis is a real risk, and we have seen it demonstrated,\u201d says Gaunt.",
            "French is working with regulatory partners, funders, patient-advocacy groups and other stakeholders to create clinical and research frameworks. \u201cWe need guidance,\u201d she says, both for device developers and clinicians. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have solutions yet.\u201d",
            "Imbrie is positive about the changes he has experienced since he first started testing the bionic arm that interfaces with his brain. Four years worth of tests have even helped him to relearn some of the natural sensations in parts of his body. \u201cWhen I started, my right side \u2014 it always felt dull or numb compared to the left side. Now when the doctor does the same test, both sides feel identical,\u201d he says. And these sensations are feeling increasingly real. \u201cI can feel my brain getting reprogrammed to feel different types of stimuli. It\u2019s like being a child learning to touch, but I have the language and imagination to describe how I\u2019m perceiving things,\u201d he says.",
            "Herr mirrors Imbrie\u2019s optimism. With innovative interfaces between machine and flesh emerging, Herr is hopeful that restored function will soon become more than just a laboratory trick.",

One OVT, called T-VEC, has been in approved in the United States to treat metastatic melanoma, but there are as yet no OVT agents approved to treat breast cancer of any stage, anywhere in the world. ",
            "Halassy stresses that she isn\u2019t a specialist in OVT, but her expertise in cultivating and purifying viruses in the laboratory gave her the confidence to try the treatment. She chose to target her tumour with two different viruses consecutively \u2014 a measles virus followed by a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Both pathogens are known to infect the type of cell from which her tumour originated, and have already been used in OVT clinical trials. A measles virus has been trialled against metastatic breast cancer.",
            "Halassy had previous experience working with both viruses, and both have a good safety record. The strain of measles she chose is used extensively in childhood vaccines, and the strain of VSV induces, at worst, mild influenza-like symptoms. ",

            "Over a two-month period, a colleague administered a regime of treatments with research-grade material freshly prepared by Halassy, injected directly into her tumour. Her oncologists agreed to monitor her during the self-treatment, so that she would be able to switch to conventional chemotherapy if things went wrong.",
            "The approach seemed to be effective: over the course of the treatment, and with no serious side effects, the tumour shrank substantially and became softer. It also detached from the pectoral muscle and skin that it had been invading, making it easy to remove surgically.",
            "How a trove of cancer genomes could improve kids\u2019 leukaemia treatment",
            "Analysis of the tumour after removal showed that it was thoroughly infiltrated with immune cells called lymphocytes, suggesting that the OVT had worked as expected and provoked Halassy\u2019s immune system to attack both the viruses and the tumour cells. \u201cAn immune response was, for sure, elicited,\u201d says Halassy. After the surgery, she received a year\u2019s treatment with the anticancer drug trastuzumab. ",
            "Stephen Russell, an OVT specialist who runs virotherapy biotech company Vyriad in Rochester, Minnesota, agrees that Halassy\u2019s case suggests the viral injections worked to shrink her tumour and cause its invasive edges to recede. ",
            "But he doesn\u2019t think her experience really breaks any new ground, because researchers are already trying to use OVT to help treat earlier-stage cancer. He isn\u2019t aware of anyone trying two viruses sequentially, but says it isn\u2019t possible to deduce whether this mattered in an \u2018n of 1\u2019 study. \u201cReally, the novelty here is, she did it to herself with a virus that she grew in her own lab,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Ethical dilemma",
            "Halassy felt a responsibility to publish her findings. But she received more than a dozen rejections from journals \u2014 mainly, she says, because the paper, co-authored with colleagues, involved self-experimentation. \u201cThe major concern was always ethical issues,\u201d says Halassy. She was particularly determined to persevere after she came across a review highlighting the value of self-experimentation2. ",
            "That journals had concerns doesn\u2019t surprise Jacob Sherkow, a law and medicine researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has examined the ethics of researcher self-experimentation in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. ",
            "Huge leap in breast cancer survival rate",
            "The problem is not that Halassy used self-experimentation as such, but that publishing her results could encourage others to reject conventional treatment and try something similar, says Sherkow. People with cancer can be particularly susceptible to trying unproven treatments. Yet, he notes, it\u2019s also important to ensure that the knowledge that comes from self-experimentation isn\u2019t lost. The paper emphasizes that self-medicating with cancer-fighting viruses \u201cshould not be the first approach\u201d in the case of a cancer diagnosis. ",
            "\u201cI think it ultimately does fall within the line of being ethical, but it isn\u2019t a slam-dunk case,\u201d says Sherkow, adding that he would have liked to see a commentary fleshing out the ethics perspective, published alongside the case report.",
            "Halassy has no regrets about self-treating, or her dogged pursuit of publication. She thinks it is unlikely that someone would try to copy her, because the treatment requires so much scientific knowledge and skill. And the experience has given her own research a new direction: in September she got funding to investigate OVT to treat cancer in domestic animals. \u201cThe focus of my laboratory has completely turned because of the positive experience with my self-treatment,\u201d she says.",

            "After the transplants, all four recipients showed immediate improvements in their vision, and a reduction in the area of the cornea affected by LSCD. The improvements persisted in all but one recipient, who showed slight reversals during a one-year observation period.",
            "Bharti says it isn\u2019t clear what exactly caused the vision improvements. It\u2019s possible that the transplanted cells themselves proliferated in the recipient\u2019s corneas. But the vision gains could also be due to the removal of scar tissue before the transplant, or the transplant triggering the recipient\u2019s own cells to migrate from other regions of the eye and rejuvenate the cornea. ",
            "Nishida says they plan to launch clinical trials in March to assess the treatment\u2019s efficacy. Several other iPS-cell-based trials are under way globally to treat eye diseases, says Bharti. \u201cThese success stories suggest we are headed in the right direction.\u201d",

            "A global analysis of private-jet use shows that the number of aircraft and trips and the distance aeroplanes covered have all soared over the past five years, exacerbating the sector\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of private flights rose to more than four million a year, increasing emissions by 46%. The study, which was published on 7 November in Communications Earth and Environment1, found that private flights produced 15.6 million tonnes of CO2 in 2023, and identified events that trips were concentrated around, including the COP28 climate summit in Dubai last year.",
            "This work \u201cis so important in the light of global warming and the absolute inequalities that we have across the world\u201d, says Milan Kl\u00f6wer, who researches the impact of aviation on global warming at the University of Oxford, UK. \u201cWhile private aviation is obviously a small share of commercial aviation, it really shows how disproportionately they\u2019re just burning the planet.\u201d",
            "h2The cost of luxury",
            "Researchers have explored the impacts of air travel on climate change. But few studies have focused on the global scale and climate cost of private jets, which is one of the most energy-consuming ways to fly. \u201cPer hour, a large private aircraft can emit more than an average person emits per year,\u201d says study co-author Stefan G\u00f6ssling, who studies transport behaviour and climate change at Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden.",
            "G\u00f6ssling and his colleagues collected private aircraft logs, which provide real-time location information for all flights, from 2019 to 2023. Flight-time data were then \u201cassociated with aircraft model-specific fuel use to determine emissions\u201d, G\u00f6ssling says.",

            "Their analysis showed that the number of private jets increased by 28.4% over the period, to almost 26,000 jets in 2023. The total distance the planes flew also increased. And, although the total CO2 emissions increased from 10.7 million to 15.6 million tonnes, the average emissions per kilometre decreased, which could be due to more efficient jet systems (see \u2018The jet set\u2019).",
            "Nearly 50% of the flights were shorter than 500 kilometres; such distances, Kl\u00f6wer says, could have been done by train or by car. And many journeys \u2014 as well as emissions \u2014 were clustered around major world events. For example, 172 of the 595 private planes that flew to the 2023 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, were also seen at the Cannes Film Festival in France that year. COP28 was linked to 291 private flights, releasing an estimated 3,800 tonnes of CO2.",
            "h2Worrying trend",
            "Although the scale of emissions from private flights is small compared with the emissions from other sources, the study argues that the rate at which they are increasing is concerning. \u201cI have already heard many colleagues say that 15.6 million tonnes is nothing in global comparison, and that we can ignore the sector,\u201d says G\u00f6ssling. \u201cI think we should see it the other way around. If individuals get to emit thousands of tonnes without consequences, why should anybody else reduce their emissions?\u201d",
            "A cleaner future for flight \u2014 aviation needs a radical redesign",
            "Kl\u00f6wer agrees that the global rise in private-jet use is \u201cnot sustainable\u201d, adding that stricter regulations would help to reduce the incentives around private flight. \u201cCarbon is a cost, and this cost should be internalized,\u201d says G\u00f6ssling. \u201cI think every country could put taxes on every private jet that lands or takes off,\u201d Kl\u00f6wer says, although he acknowledges that such rules would be \u201cpolitically very, very difficult\u201d.",
            "Kl\u00f6wer is keen for future studies to explore non-CO2 emissions, such as methane and sulfur dioxide, produced by flights. He says that, although calculating these emissions would be challenging, such research could help to provide a clearer picture of how individual jets contribute to climate change. \u201cYou could really pin down people and say \u2026 \u2018this is the amount of warming you are responsible personally for\u2019.\u201d",

            "Controversy has erupted among researchers over an effort to adopt blood tests and brain scans for diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, rather than the cognitive screening that has been used for decades.",
            "Proponents of the change say that new biomarker tests can detect Alzheimer\u2019s at a very early stage \u2014 the best time to apply any treatments that are developed to reverse the disease. But critics say that, although the effort is well-intentioned, it means that people can be diagnosed with a single test, even if they have no symptoms of cognitive decline \u2014 and might never develop them.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s a risk of misunderstanding and distress that individuals who are asymptomatic will have if we tell them they have Alzheimer\u2019s, whereas nothing will happen in their lifetime in a majority of cases,\u201d says Nicolas Villain, a neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris, who co-wrote a paper1 published on 1 November in JAMA Neurology criticizing the new diagnostic criteria.",
            "h2Plaques and tangles",
            "The brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s have two key features: plaques of sticky amyloid-\u03b2 proteins and tangles formed from tau proteins. The neurodegeneration linked with the development of these plaques and tangles is irreversible, so researchers have been searching for treatments to give to healthy people to ward off this damage entirely.",
            "In the past few years, companies have started marketing drugs that slow Alzheimer\u2019s-related cognitive decline by clearing amyloid from the brain, and scientists have been perfecting highly accurate tests for both amyloid and tau protein.",
            "Researchers call for a major rethink of how Alzheimer\u2019s treatments are evaluated",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s this confluence of the possibility of widespread clinically available, accurate diagnosis with the ability to do something about the disease that prompted us to update the criteria,\u201d says Clifford Jack, a specialist in clinical Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia research at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who co-led the effort to revise the diagnosis criteria. Jack and his colleagues in a working group for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, a non-profit research and advocacy organization in Chicago, Illinois, published their guidelines2 in the journal Alzheimer\u2019s & Dementia in June.",
            "The criteria say that any one abnormal result on a core set of biomarker-based tests is sufficient to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s. These tests include measurements of amyloid and tau-protein levels in blood or cerebrospinal fluid, and a positron-emission tomography (PET) brain scan, which helps to quantify amyloid plaques.",
            "h2Devastating diagnosis",
            "But Villain and his colleagues point out in their critique that a large swathe of people diagnosed in this way would never develop any cognitive symptoms: a 65-year-old man who is amyloid-biomarker positive has a lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s dementia of roughly 22%, which is only about 1.7 times higher than the risk for a similar individual who is amyloid-biomarker negative.",
            "The critics also argue that people who test positive for a single biomarker and are cognitively unimpaired should be informed that they are at risk of the disease but should not be given an official Alzheimer\u2019s diagnosis. A person without symptoms who either tests positive on multiple biomarker tests or has a gene variant known to significantly increase the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s dementia could be given a diagnosis of \u2018presymptomatic\u2019 Alzheimer\u2019s, the critics write.",
            "Landmark Alzheimer\u2019s drug approval confounds research community",
            "Jack acknowledges that biomarker testing makes it possible for asymptomatic individuals to be diagnosed with the disease \u2014 but the guidelines state that biologically based diagnoses are intended to \u201cassist rather than supplant\u201d clinical evaluations. And the working group does not recommend Alzheimer\u2019s biomarker tests for healthy people, so a hypothetical positive diagnosis for someone without symptoms should not come to pass, he says.",
            "However, the new criteria might expand eligibility for clinical trials, which could help to develop treatments for asymptomatic individuals, Jack says. \u201cThe reality is that every person who ultimately becomes demented due to Alzheimer\u2019s went through a period of time when they were asymptomatic with the disease,\u201d he says. \u201cMedicine needs to focus its future on how to prevent the onset of symptoms, because by the time someone becomes symptomatic, extensive irreversible damage has already occurred.\u201d",
            "h2Nothing in the cupboard",
            "But medications for biomarker-positive, asymptomatic people are currently non-existent except in clinical trials, says Andrea Bozoki, a cognitive neurologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill who co-wrote the JAMA Neurology critique. This would leave such people with the mental anguish of having a diagnosis for an incurable disease but lacking treatment options, she says.",
            "The new drugs that that slow the cognitive decline caused by the disease are approved in the United States only for people who are already experiencing mild cognitive impairment.",
            "Bozoki worries that the new criteria will spur healthy people who fear that they are at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s, or who have a family history of the disease, to find a doctor who will order a biomarker test for them. And if they\u2019re diagnosed, she says, they might be prescribed the new Alzheimer\u2019s drugs. These haven\u2019t been shown to be effective in asymptomatic populations, cost tens of thousands of US dollars a year and carry a risk of brain bleeding and fatal seizures.",
            "This will make it even more important for researchers and doctors to ensure that they are properly communicating risk and uncertainty as Alzheimer\u2019s tests and drugs become more available, says Winston Chiong, a neurologist and ethicist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved with either workgroup.",

The German government, CERN\u2019s largest financial contributor, expressed scepticism about FCC earlier this year, and China could beat CERN to the punch with a similar project.",

He is currently chair of the Science and Technology Facilities Council, a UK funding agency, and is a representative on the CERN Council, the board that oversees the lab on behalf of its member countries. Thomson will take up the director-general post when Gianotti\u2019s second consecutive five-year term ends at the end of 2025. ",
            "In a press conference on 7 November, both Gianotti and Thomson stressed the need for continuity, and the importance of the ongoing upgrade to the 27-kilometre LHC.
