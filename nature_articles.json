A different, fetal form of haemoglobin can help to compensate for the effects of these mutations, but its production is typically turned off shortly after birth. Casgevy uses CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to disable that genetic off-switch, allowing fetal haemoglobin to be produced again.",
            "Last November, the United Kingdom became the first country to approve Casgevy. The US Food and Drug Administration followed suit in December, and several other countries have since approved the therapy.

At the haematology meeting in San Diego, researchers presented data showing that the benefits can last for at least five years for both sickle-cell disease and \u03b2-thalassaemia. Treatment with Casgevy reduced the need for blood transfusions in people with \u03b2-thalassaemia and for hospitalizations in people with sickle-cell disease.

Previous research showed3 that the skin of adult mice that had been raised without microbes could be colonized by Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common and harmless bacterium found on human skin. This long-term colonization triggered the production of specific immune cells, called T cells, which helped to strengthen local immunity.",

The skin then made antibodies against S. epidermidis; these persisted for at least 200 days and could form without previous exposure to other microbes.",
            "The skin was able to generate this immune response even when lymph nodes \u2014 the immune hubs that help to activate immune cells \u2014 were disabled.

            "In a second study2, Fischbach and his team showed that S. epidermidis triggers an antibody response resembling that seen in conventional vaccines.",
            "By modifying S. epidermidis to display foreign proteins \u2014 such as part of the tetanus toxin \u2014 on its surface, the researchers were able to induce immune responses in the mice\u2019s bloodstream and in mucous membranes such as the lining of the nose. These responses protected the animals when they were given a lethal dose of the toxin.",

            "Fischbach\u2019s work is part of a growing interest in developing vaccines that induce antibodies in mucosal areas. This type of protection could help to stop respiratory or other infections before they start and reduce the spread of disease.",
            "Another advantage over conventional vaccines is that engineered S. epidermidis could be added to a cream and simply applied to the skin. Such a vaccine, Fischbach says, would be cheap to produce and easy to distribute. Furthermore, it would not have to be administered by health-care worker, making it especially useful in under-served regions of the world.",
            "The idea of using the immune response from S. epidermidis in the skin to develop therapies \u201cis really out there\u201d, says Thomas Kupper, a skin immunologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cIt is a super-creative application of these findings.\u201d",
            "But Kupper adds that it\u2019s still unclear whether the skin\u2019s response to S. epidermidis is as strong in people as it is in mice. Fischbach notes that early data suggest healthy people have high levels of antibodies against S. epidermidis. But before this approach can be used in people, it must first be proved safe and effective in non-human primates and in humans, following the usual process for developing medicines, he says. \u201cIf this is going to be deployed in the real world, we have to show that it works.\u201d",

That includes providing alternative text for figures and headers for tables, as well as adding the tags necessary to make PDF files accessible to low-vision and blind readers, who typically access these files using assistive reading devices.",
            "Only around 3% of the analysed studies met all six criteria, the analysis found, and just under 75% met none of the criteria at all. ",
            "\u201cAfter 2019, there was a very sharp decline across almost all of the criteria that we measured,\u201d says study co-author Anukriti Kumar, an information scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors attribute that trend to the move towards rapid-publishing methods such as preprints and online-first publishing, and say that it was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded quick communication of research findings.",
            "The analysis was presented in October at the 26th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility in St. John\u2019s, Canada.",
            "Lucy Lu Wang, also an information scientist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study, published2 a similar analysis of accessibility of more than 11,000 PDFs in 2021. \u201cThings were mostly improving,\u201d she recalls. But with new global open-access policies and changes with how publishers are producing PDFs, accessibility overall has decreased since then,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cAccessibility often falls to the wayside, because it disproportionately affects a smaller group of people,\u201d Wang says, \u201cor the kind of people who don\u2019t have as much clout.\u201d",
            "h2Systemic changes required",
            "For the 2021 analysis, the authors interviewed several low-vision and blind scientists, some of whom said that they chose their fields of study in part because of how easily accessible the associated literature was. \u201cPeople were drawn to fields that had more accessible papers,\u201d Wang says. \u201cThe barriers to working in those fields were lower.\u201d",
            "Sheri Wells-Jensen, a linguistics researcher at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who is fully blind, tells Nature that the hassle of finding accessible papers is such that she sometimes doesn\u2019t even try. \u201cI never expect to be able to go to an open-access journal and just get the PDF and read it with the same level of ease and convenience as other scientists do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got different software that could do some scanning, but you have to be a little bit of a wizard sometimes.\u201d",
            "Wells-Jensen notes that academic journals rarely provide information about accessibility for scientists with visual impairment in the \u2018information for authors\u2019 sections of their websites, making it unclear how researchers should prepare their manuscripts for optimal accessibility. Manuscript-submission systems themselves are also often inaccessible, she adds.",
            "Addressing such accessibility shortfalls will require \u201csystemic changes\u201d from authors, publishers and others, Kumar says.",
            "Todd Carpenter, executive director of the National Information Standards Organization, a non-profit group based in Baltimore, Maryland, which develops technical standards for publishers and libraries, suggests that an audit of publishers\u2019 production processes would be useful. \u201cWhile author guidance is important,\u201d he notes, \u201cthis is primarily a publisher production process, more so than it is an authoring process.\u201d As publishers strive to boost efficiency and cut costs, \u201csometimes the critical components, such as accessibility support, end up on the cutting-room floor\u201d.",
            "\u201cImproving PDF accessibility requires changes to culture, systems and processes that can be challenging for publishers and authors to achieve,\u201d says a spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes Nature. (Nature is independent of its publisher.) \u201cWe provide support to staff and editors around ways in which to achieve this, which can include \u2014 improving contrast between text and background, optimizing colour, making links more descriptive, increasing font size, and ensuring that content such as rich media and tables have alternative text provided.\u201d",
            "A spokesperson for scientific publisher Wiley adds: \u201cWe are engaged in several ongoing projects to improve the accessibility of our platforms and our content, including those that deliver PDF accessibility, with the aim of ensuring that customers have equal access to research regardless of age, ability or situation.\u201d",
            "With all the challenges the world is facing, equal access is more important than ever, Wells-Jensen says: \u201cWe really can\u2019t afford to give disincentives to any kind of scientist who is working hard to solve any kind of problem.\u201d",

            "Concealing some of the information on job applications led to more women being hired.Credit: Christopher Ames/Getty",
            "In 2017, when Sherri Christian returned to her institution after a year-long sabbatical, she looked around the biochemistry department and realized that she was the last female hire, seven years earlier. At the time, there were 19 members, just 6 of them women, including her. ",
            "During her sabbatical, Christian attended a talk about diversity and inclusion at a Canadian Society for Immunology meeting at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Inspired by what she learnt, Christian and her colleagues set about making hiring diversity a priority. ",
            "By this year, her department at the Memorial University of Newfoundland Faculty of Medicine in St John\u2019s, Canada, had managed to achieve gender parity. The changes made to hiring processes are described in a preprint posted to the bioRxiv server last month1. It has not been peer reviewed. ",
            "Christian\u2019s department is not alone in taking action to boost gender diversity among their staff. In 2022, leaders of several departments at the University of Melbourne, Australia, reported the details of affirmative-action recruitment initiatives that led to more female hires.",
            "And this year, the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands revealed the results of a five-year policy stating that only female applicants would be considered for permanent academic roles during the first six months of recruitment. The controversial policy led to 50% of all new hires being women, up from 30% previously. ",
            "h2Loneliness ",
            "When the Newfoundland project started in 2020, Christian was the only woman to have been hired in ten years. \u201cIt was a bit lonely,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d look around and there\u2019d be no women on the committee you are sitting in, or it would be the same other person over and over again because there are only so many people to choose from.\u201d ",
            "Between 2020 and 2024, the department\u2019s job postings emphasized the equity, diversity and inclusion aspects of the application process for entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. ",
            "But the main change was anonymizing job applications in an attempt to stamp out implicit bias on search committees. ",
            "Committee members were given copies of application documents in which candidates\u2019 names and contact information were redacted, as were references to their institution, country and leaves of absence. Gender, religion, ethnicity, race, age and nationality were also removed. This task was done by the head of the department, Mark Berry, who was not involved in evaluating candidates. His work took, on average, 90 minutes per application. ",
            "The degree type and year of completion remained, as did the location and title of any national or international conference presentations. Publication titles, including the year of publication and journal, also remained. Berry also added candidates\u2019 authorship position in the publications and presentations. ",
            "The redacted versions were then used to draw up a shortlist of around ten candidates for each of the five roles being filled during the study period. ",
