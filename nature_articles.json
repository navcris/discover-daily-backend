            "For the first time, chemists have made a class of molecules previously thought too unstable to exist, and used them to generate exotic compounds1. Scientists say these notorious molecules, known as anti-Bredt olefins (ABOs), offer a new path to synthesizing challenging drug candidates.",
            "The work is \u201ca landmark contribution\u201d, says Craig Williams, a chemist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. The findings are published in Science.",
            "Organic molecules, which contain carbon, typically conform to specific shapes because of the way their atoms bond together. For instance, olefins, also called alkenes \u2014 hydrocarbons that are often used in reactions for drug development \u2014 have one or more double bonds between two carbon atoms, resulting in the atoms being arranged in one plane.",
            "The 100-year-old Bredt\u2019s rule \u2014 which was proposed in 1924 by organic chemist Julius Bredt \u2014 states that, in small molecules made up of two rings that share atoms, such as some types of alkene, double bonds between two carbon atoms cannot occur where the rings join together, called the bridgehead position. This is because the bonds would force the molecule into a tortured, strained 3D shape that makes it highly reactive and unstable, says study co-author Neil Garg, a chemist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cStill, 100 years later, people would say these types of structures are forbidden or too unstable to make,\u201d he says.",
            "Although the rule has made its way into chemistry textbooks, it hasn\u2019t stopped researchers from trying to break it. Previous research has hinted that it\u2019s possible to create ABOs that have a double carbon\u2013carbon bond at the bridgehead position2. But attempts to synthesize them in their complete form were unsuccessful because the reaction conditions were too harsh, says Garg.",
            "h2Trapping agents",
            "In the latest attempt, Garg and his colleagues treated a precursor compound with a fluoride source to kick-start a milder \u2018elimination\u2019 reaction, which removes groups of atoms from molecules. This resulted in a molecule that had the telltale ABO double-carbon bond. When the researchers added various trapping agents \u2014 chemicals that capture unstable molecules as they react \u2014 to this 3D ABO, they were able to produce several complex compounds that could be isolated. This suggests that the reactions of ABOs with different trapping agents can be leveraged to synthesize 3D molecules, which are useful for designing new drugs, says Garg.",
            "Unlike typical alkenes, ABOs are chiral compounds \u2014 molecules that don\u2019t perfectly match up with their mirror image. Garg and his colleagues synthesized and trapped an ABO that was enantioenriched, which means they produced more of one mirroring pair than the other. This finding suggests that ABOs could be used as unconventional building blocks for enantioenriched compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals.",
            "Chuang-Chuang Li, a chemist at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, says that the approach could be used to explore innovative synthesis pathways for other challenging molecules, such as the chemotherapy drug paclitexal (sold as Taxol) \u2014 a complex, multi-ringed molecule that is difficult to create in the laboratory. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable and reliable method,\u201d says Li.",
            "Garg and his team are exploring other reactions involving ABOs, and are investigating how to synthesize other molecules with seemingly impossible structures. \u201cWe can be thinking a little bit more outside of the box,\u201d he says.",

The trial was sponsored and designed by Novo Nordisk, which is based in Bagsv\u00e6rd, Denmark, and makes semaglutide, a drug sold as Ozempic for treating diabetes and Wegovy for treating obesity. Bliddal served briefly as a paid consultant to the company during trial planning.",
            "h2Spreading scourge",
            "Osteoarthritis, which causes stiff, painful joints, is among the most common conditions of ageing, and the knee is the most frequently affected joint. People who have obesity are at a relatively high risk of developing arthritic knees because their weight puts extra stress on their joints. Obesity also worsens symptoms, Callahan says. Pain from the condition can keep people from exercising, Bliddal says, making it extremely difficult for them to lose weight by lifestyle changes alone.",
            "How rival weight-loss drugs fare at treating obesity, diabetes and more",
            "The trial enrolled some 400 participants on five continents and randomly assigned them to receive weekly injections of either semaglutide or a placebo. They also received counselling on healthy eating and physical activity. When the trial began, participants had obesity, and their average score on a 100-point pain scale was 71 \u2014 high enough that walking was painful.",
            "After 68 weeks of injections, participants taking semaglutide had lost much more weight than those taking the placebo. They also reported a much bigger drop in pain score: an average of 42 points, compared with 28 points for placebo recipients. Those receiving semaglutide noticed a greater improvement in everyday functioning, such as climbing stairs, too.",
            "The improvement probably stems in part from a decreased load on the knee because of the weight loss, the authors write. But semaglutide also has anti-inflammatory effects, which might help to explain the pain relief.",
            "Despite the benefits, Bliddal is concerned about the long-term outlook for those who use semaglutide to relieve knee arthritis. \u201cDo these guys go on with semaglutide forever\u201d to manage their pain? People who stop taking the drugs generally regain the lost weight, and the medications are expensive \u2014 a month\u2019s supply can cost hundreds of US dollars.",
            "Callahan emphasizes that although the results seem \u201cvery exciting\u201d, it\u2019s important for people to supplement anti-obesity drugs with lifestyle changes for long-term weight maintenance.",

            "There are four known variants of the monkeypox virus: clades Ia, Ib, IIa and IIb (see \u2018Quick guide to the strains of monkeypox virus\u2019). Historically, clade I viruses have appeared mostly in Central Africa, and clade II viruses have cropped up in West Africa.",
            "This all changed in the mid-2010s, when a clade II strain sparked an outbreak in Nigeria. At the time, some researchers suggested that the variant might be capable of transmission through sexual contact. Their insights proved prescient: a similar clade II strain, called IIb, sparked a global outbreak of mpox in 2022 that has infected more than 90,000 people and continues today.",
            "Clade Ia: a strain that has been spreading in Central Africa since the virus was first discovered to infect humans in 1970. Most infections have been in children, and it was known to mainly transmit from animal to human \u2014 until recently.",

Modes of transmission are not fully understood; there is no documented evidence of sexual transmission, but it is likely that all forms of close contact contribute to its spread.",
            "Clade IIb: the strain responsible for the still-simmering 2022 global outbreak. Known to spread from person to person, including through sexual contact. Most affected population has been men who have sex with men.",
            "Meanwhile, clade I viruses have caused sporadic infections in people for more than 50 years \u2014 largely in rural regions of Central Africa. But in late 2023, researchers identified a rapidly growing outbreak in more densely populated, urban areas in eastern regions of the DRC that disproportionately affected sex workers, suggesting that this strain of the virus could, like IIb, spread readily between people.",
            "Genomic sequencing confirmed that the variant causing this outbreak contained several key differences from other clade I viruses, leading researchers to name it Ib. This strain has been detected in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Thailand, India, Germany and six African countries that had never reported mpox infections before. The DRC has been hit particularly hard: the country has reported nearly 36,000 suspected infections and more than 1,000 deaths from mpox in 2024.",
            "But now \u2014 about one year after researchers detected an outbreak of clade Ib in eastern DRC \u2014 clade Ia is worrying health officials, too. The strain has also been on the rise in western regions of the DRC and in Kinshasa. In particular, having both Ia and Ib circulating in the capital city threatens the 17 million people living there and raises the possibility of clade I spreading internationally, given that Kinshasa is a travel hub.",
            "h2Signs of evolution",
            "Health officials have been using genomic-sequencing tools to track the outbreak. As part of the effort, Mbala and his colleagues sequenced virus samples from infections in Kinshasa. In samples of both the clade Ia and Ib virus, they found a specific pattern of single-letter genetic mutations indicative of the ongoing battle between the human immune system and the virus \u2014 a pattern that would be unlikely to appear unless there was sustained human-to-human spread.",
            "Mpox vaccine roll-out begins in Africa: what will success look like?",

That the researchers didn\u2019t spot the pattern suggests that it might be a recent development. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pick up on strong signs of evolution\u201d in the more rural and endemic regions of the DRC, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who collaborates with Mbala and co-authored the August preprint as well as the Virological one. \u201cBut in Kinshasa, it seems that there is something unique going on.\u201d",
            "Clade Ia might also have the ability to spread through sexual contact: researchers reported the first probable case of sexually transmitted clade I mpox last year2, and another such publication is forthcoming, Kindrachuk says.",
            "Given that clade I has been circulating between animals and people in the DRC since 1970, Kindrachuk adds that it will be important to investigate why clade Ib suddenly emerged in 2023, and why Ia has caused a surge in the number of detected infections in the past two years. \u201cIs it because we\u2019re better at surveillance, or because we\u2019re more conscious of mpox at the community level? Is it because people have been moving around more after the [COVID-19] pandemic, or because there\u2019s been a greater reliance on contact with wildlife?\u201d he asks.",
            "For now, plans to roll out the continent\u2019s first doses of mpox vaccines are unlikely to change in light of these findings, says Nicaise Ndembi, a virologist at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa. Health officials have already been allocating doses to regions that have a higher number of infections, regardless of the specific strain found in the area, he says.",

After a heart attack, immune cells trigger a massive burst of inflammation in the heart, he says, and the researchers wondered whether these immune changes also occurred in the brain.",
            "The team found that, after a mouse\u2019s heart attack, immune cells called monocytes flooded its brain. These cells produced large amounts of a protein called tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which is an important regulator of inflammation and also promotes sleep.",
            "To confirm that these cells were linked to the increased sleep, researchers prevented monocytes from accumulating in the rodents\u2019 brains. As a result, \u201cthe mice no longer had this increase in slow-wave sleep after their heart attack,\u201d McAlpine says, supporting the theory that the influx of monocytes to the brain contributes to the post-heart-attack sleep boost. Similar experiments confirmed TNF\u2019s role as a messenger to sleep-inducing brain cells.",

In 2020, two US drug companies spearheaded the development of vaccines that helped to contain a pandemic. Two years later, a California start-up firm released the revolutionary artificial-intelligence (AI) tool ChatGPT and a national laboratory broke a fundamental barrier in nuclear fusion.",
            "This year, the United States is on track to spend US$1 trillion on research and development (R&D), much more than any other country. And its labs are a magnet for researchers from around the globe, with workers born in other nations accounting for 43% of doctorate-holders in the US workforce in science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM).",

This has created \u201ca perception that the United States is increasingly hostile to foreigners\u201d, the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) reported in August1, warning that the United States \u201ccan no longer take for granted that it will remain the destination of choice for the world\u2019s best and brightest\u201d. The academies called for a government-wide effort to attract and retain international talent and improve STEM education at home.",
            "The future of US science hinges, in no small way, on the November election. Together, the next president and Congress will play a pivotal part in setting the course for the US scientific enterprise for years to come by establishing funding plans, immigration policies and national-security measures that affect international collaboration.",

Combining government and private funding, the United States spent $923 billion in 2022 (the last year for which full numbers are available), or around 30% of global R&D spending.",
            "But as China\u2019s economy has soared, so has its R&D spending, to the equivalent of $812 billion (adjusted for purchasing power parity). On that trajectory it will draw level with the United States before 2030 (see \u2018Research funding race\u2019).",

In 2022, this time with an eye on China, Congress united to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized $280 billion to promote the domestic semiconductor industry and boost the budgets of several major research agencies.

By contrast, China is overtaking the United States in materials science, physical sciences and computer science, which are areas where US investments have fallen short.",
            "The question, come January, is whether the next president and Congress will work together to advance scientific funding commitments that both political parties have endorsed in the past.

            "Biden seeks to boost science funding \u2014 but his budget faces an ominous future",
            "When it comes to setting spending priorities, Congress often goes its own way no matter what presidents propose in their budgets. For example, although previous president Donald Trump repeatedly sought to cut science budgets, it was during his tenure that Congress broke its own self-imposed budget caps and gave science agencies a significant boost in funding alongside the increases in defence spending sought by the Trump administration, says Jennifer Zeitzer, who leads the public-affairs office at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology in Rockville, Maryland.",
            "Today, lawmakers are once again operating under a budget agreement that seeks to cap overall spending until 2025, which could make it difficult to increase STEM spending, but it\u2019s unclear how that discussion will play out with a new president and Congress next year.",
            "\u201cI call it the whiplash effect,\u201d says Zeitzer. Funding agencies are constantly buffeted by shifting political winds that produce big promises \u2014 and occasionally big investments \u2014 before an inevitable swing back towards austerity. Half of the time, funding agencies are operating under provisional budgets and the looming threat of a government shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re supposed to be competitive if we\u2019re facing another 20 years of this,\u201d Zeitzer says.",

            "Biden ultimately ended both policies, but many scholars say they could make a comeback if Trump prevails in November. Last month, Trump vowed to reinstate his travel ban, and Republicans who control the US House of Representatives have approved legislation that would, if enacted, essentially reinstate the China Initiative.",
            "These tensions might be taking a toll: surveys in the United States have found that many Chinese researchers worry about prejudice after the China Initiative. A study6 published this year examined the propensity of Chinese students to enrol in US PhD programmes, compared with a control group of non-Chinese students. The two were in step until 2016, but the Chinese students became 15% less likely to enrol by 2019 \u2014 and more likely to enrol in non-US English-speaking countries. (The rapid drop of enrolments during the pandemic means that the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, can\u2019t reliably be extended to later years.)",

Part of a broader trend towards increasing political polarization, these culture wars have engulfed campuses and led some lawmakers to impose limits on what university researchers can study and teach, and to curtail policies that promote diversity, equity and inclusion. The August NASEM report1 tapped into some of these sentiments, raising the fear that the United States\u2019 reputation is beginning to suffer abroad. \u201cSome of the nation\u2019s most important advantages in attracting and retaining talent are the intangibles: values, freedom, and opportunity,\u201d the report stated.",

By contrast, Trump and his appointees repeatedly undermined government scientists and agencies during his time in office, especially on issues such as climate change and public health.",

Besides Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the results of any election he doesn\u2019t win and his promises to use the powers of the federal government for political retribution, researchers fear that he just might succeed in reshaping the US government by replacing thousands of federal scientists with obedient political appointees.

Because of the way the plant reproduces, this collection of aspens is technically all one tree, supported by a single, vast root system. Pando is triploid, meaning that its cells contain three copies of each chromosome, rather than two. As a result, Pando cannot reproduce sexually and mix its DNA with that of other trees, and instead creates clones of itself.",

However, over a smaller scale of 1\u201315 metres the trend was stronger, with stems that were closer together having significantly more shared mutations. Pando covers an area of more than 40 hectares, \u201cbut it almost looks like it\u2019s a well-mixed pot of genetic information\u201d, says Ratcliff.",

            "But China\u2019s broader research-evaluation system \u2014 which places emphasis on researchers securing NSFC grants, in particular \u2014 is making the competition for limited funding particularly intense, says Tang.",
            "NSFC grants are a measure of achievement when researchers are assessed for contracts, promotions and tenure, says a researcher who requested to remain anonymous because they are worried their view might harm their chances of obtaining NSFC grants in future. Many early-career researchers view NSFC funding as opening the door to career opportunities rather than just as a vehicle to fund their projects, the researcher says. \u201cWe regard the NSFC as a bridge.\u201d",

            "The growing number of early-career researchers is set to add to funding pressures. In 2023, around 1.3 million graduate students were enrolled in universities across China, an increase of 4.8% on the previous year, according to the Ministry of Education.",
            "Another factor adding to the pressure to obtain grant funding is that many universities don\u2019t offer start-up packages to young scientists, which forces them to obtain grants from elsewhere to get up and running, adds Cao. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have money from external sources, it\u2019s very difficult to start your career,\u201d he says.",
            "One way to ease the competition and pressure on young Chinese scientists is to create a more diverse range of funding sources, says Hu. Universities and research institutions should also base their research evaluations on the outcomes of funded projects instead of the number of grants researchers win, he adds. \u201cThere has to be a change in the way these young scientists are evaluated,\u201d says Hu.",
