            "From scientists manipulating figures to the mass production of fake papers by paper mills, problematic manuscripts have long plagued the scholarly literature. Science sleuths work tirelessly to uncover this misconduct to correct the scientific record. But their job is becoming harder, owing to the introduction of a powerful new tool for fraudsters: generative artificial intelligence (AI).",
            "\u201cGenerative AI is evolving very fast,\u201d says Jana Christopher, an image-integrity analyst at FEBS Press in Heidelberg, Germany. \u201cThe people that work in my field \u2014 image integrity and publication ethics \u2014 are getting increasingly worried about the possibilities that it offers.\u201d",
            "AI-generated images and video are here: how could they shape research?",
            "The ease with which generative-AI tools can create text, images and data raises fears of an increasingly untrustworthy scientific literature awash with fake figures, manuscripts and conclusions that are difficult for humans to spot. Already, an arms race is emerging as integrity specialists, publishers and technology companies race to develop AI tools that can assist in rapidly detecting deceptive, AI-generated elements of papers.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a scary development,\u201d Christopher says. \u201cBut there are also clever people and good structural changes that are being suggested.\u201d",
            "Research-integrity specialists say that, although AI-generated text is already permitted by many journals under some circumstances, the use of such tools for creating images or other data is less likely to be viewed as acceptable. \u201cIn the near future, we may be okay with AI-generated text,\u201d says Elisabeth Bik, an image-forensics specialist and consultant in San Francisco, California. \u201cBut I draw the line at generating data.\u201d",
            "What ChatGPT and generative AI mean for science",
            "Bik, Christopher and others suspect that data, including images, fabricated using generative AI are already widespread in the literature, and that paper mills are taking advantage of AI tools to produce manuscripts en masse (see \u2018Quiz: can you spot AI fakes?\u2019).",
            "h2Under the radar",
            "Pinpointing AI-produced images poses a huge challenge: they are often almost impossible to distinguish from real ones, at least with the naked eye. \u201cWe get the feeling that we encounter AI-generated images every day,\u201d Christopher says. \u201cBut as long as you can\u2019t prove it, there\u2019s really very little you can do.\u201d",
            "There are some clear instances of generative-AI use in scientific images, such as the now-infamous figure of a rat with absurdly large genitalia and nonsensical labels, created using the image tool Midjourney. The graphic, published by a journal in February, sparked a social-media storm and was retracted days later.",

            "Most cases aren\u2019t so obvious. Figures fabricated with Adobe Photoshop or similar tools before the rise of generative-AI \u2014 especially in molecular and cell biology \u2014 often contain telltale signs that sleuths can spot, such as identical backgrounds or an unusual absence of smears or stains. AI-made figures often lack such signs. \u201cI see tonnes of papers where I think, these Western blots do not look real \u2014 but there\u2019s no smoking gun,\u201d Bik says. \u201cYou can only say they just look weird, and that of course isn\u2019t enough evidence to write to an editor.\u201d",
            "But signs suggest that AI-made figures are appearing in published manuscripts. Text written using tools such as ChatGPT is on the rise in papers, given away by standard chatbot phrases that authors forget to remove and telltale words that AI models tend to use. \u201cSo we have to assume that it\u2019s also happening for data and for images,\u201d says Bik.",
            "Another clue that fraudsters are using sophisticated image tools is that most of the issues that sleuths are currently detecting are in papers that are several years old. \u201cIn the past couple of years, we\u2019ve seen fewer and fewer image problems,\u201d Bik says. \u201cI think most folks who have gotten caught doing image manipulation have moved on to creating cleaner images.\u201d",
            "h2How to create images",
            "Creating clean images using generative AI is not difficult. Kevin Patrick, a scientific-image sleuth known as Cheshire on social media, has demonstrated just how easy it can be and posted his results on X. Using Photoshop\u2019s AI tool Generative Fill, Patrick created realistic images \u2014 that could feasibly appear in scientific papers \u2014 of tumours, cell cultures, Western blots and more. Most of the images took less than a minute to produce (see \u2018Generating bogus science\u2019).",
            "\u201cIf I can do this, certainly the people who are getting paid to generate fake data are going to be doing this,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a whole bunch of other data that could be generated with tools like this.\u201d",
            "Some publishers say that they have found evidence of AI-generated content in published studies. These include PLoS, which has been alerted to suspicious content and found evidence of AI-generated text and data in papers and submissions through internal investigations, says Ren\u00e9e Hoch, managing editor of PLoS\u2019s publication-ethics team in San Francisco, California. (Hoch notes that AI use is not forbidden in PLoS journals, and that its AI policy focuses on author accountability and transparent disclosures.)",

            "Other tools might also provide opportunities for people wishing to create fake content. Last month, researchers published1 a generative-AI model for creating high-resolution microscopy images \u2014 and some integrity specialists have raised concerned about the work. \u201cThis technology can easily be used by people with bad intentions to quickly generate hundreds or thousands of fake images,\u201d Bik says.",
            "Yoav Shechtman at the Technion\u2013Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, the tool\u2019s creator, says that the tool is helpful for producing training data for models because high-resolution microscopy images are difficult to obtain. But, he adds, it isn\u2019t useful for generating fake because users have little control over the output. Existing imaging software such as Photoshop is more useful for manipulating figures, he suggests.",
            "h2Weeding out fakes",
            "Human eyes might not be able to catch generative AI-made images, but AI might (see \u2018AI images are hard to spot\u2019).",
            "The makers behind tools such as Imagetwin and Proofig, which use AI to detect integrity issues in scientific figures, are expanding their software to weed out images created by generative AI. Because such images are so difficult to detect, both companies are creating their own databases of generative-AI images to train their algorithms.",
            "AI models fed AI-generated data quickly spew nonsense",
            "Proofig has already released a feature in its tool for detecting AI-generated microscopy images. Company co-founder Dror Kolodkin-Gal in Rehovot, Israel, says that, when tested on thousands of AI-generated and real images from papers, the algorithm identified AI images 98% of the time and had a 0.02% false-positive rate. Dror adds that the team is now working on trying to understand what, exactly, their algorithm detects.",
            "\u201cI have great hopes for these tools,\u201d Christopher says. But she notes that their outputs will always need to be assessed by an expert who can verify the issues they flag. Christopher hasn\u2019t yet seen evidence that AI image-detection software are reliable (Proofig\u2019s internal evaluation has not been published). These tools are \u201climited, but certainly very useful, as it means we can scale up our effort of screening submissions,\u201d she adds.",

            "Multiple publishers and research institutions already use Proofig and Imagetwin. The Science journals, for example, use Proofig to scan for image-integrity issues. According to Meagan Phelan, communications director for Science in Washington DC, the tool has not yet uncovered any AI-generated images.",
            "Springer Nature, which publishes Nature, is developing its own detection tools for text and images, called Geppetto and SnapShot, which flag irregularities that are then assessed by humans. (The Nature news team is editorially independent of its publisher.)",
            "h2Fraudsters, beware",
            "Publishing groups are also taking steps to address AI-made images. A spokesperson for the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical (STM) Publishers in Oxford, UK, said that it is taking the problem \u201cvery seriously\u201d and pointed to initiatives such as United2Act and the STM Integrity Hub, which are tackling paper mills and other scientific-integrity issues.",
            "ChatGPT one year on: who is using it, how and why?",
            "Christopher, who is chairing an STM working group on image alterations and duplications, says that there is a growing realization that developing ways to verify raw data \u2014 such as labelling images taken from microscopes with invisible watermarks akin to those being used in AI-generated text \u2014 might be the way forward. This will require new technologies and new standards for equipment manufacturers, she adds.",
            "Patrick and others are worried that publishers will not act quickly enough to address the threat. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that this will just be another generation of problems in the literature that they don\u2019t get to until it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
            "Still, some are optimistic that the AI-generated content that enters papers today will be discovered in the future.",
            "\u201cI have full confidence that technology will improve to the point that it can detect the stuff that\u2019s getting done today \u2014 because at some point, it will be viewed as relatively crude,\u201d Patrick says. \u201cFraudsters shouldn\u2019t sleep well at night. They could fool today\u2019s process, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to fool the process forever.\u201d",

            "Two years ago, after more than 190 countries at a United Nations summit made a historic pledge to protect the world\u2019s species, questions arose about whether they could afford to keep that promise. At the latest meeting \u2014 held in Cali, Colombia, over the past two weeks \u2014 fights about conservation funding took centre stage, with little resolution.",
            "Can the world save a million species from extinction?",
            "But there were some bright spots. One was that negotiators approved an agreement that paves the way for large companies to pay for the use of digital genetic information extracted from nature, if it generates profit. For instance, a highly profitable agribusiness in the United Kingdom might use a digital DNA sequence from a plant found in Brazil to improve a crop. Under the agreement, that business will be encouraged to pay 1% of its profits or 0.1% of its revenue into a fund that could help countries such as Brazil to pay for conservation. ",
            "The agreement seemed far off before this year\u2019s summit. Civil-society groups and researchers are calling it a crucial victory in the face of rapid decline in global biodiversity. ",
            "\u201cIt is a voluntary mechanism, so there\u2019s everything to be seen about how we get that to work and make sure companies are doing it,\u201d says Yadvinder Malhi, an ecosystems researcher at the University of Oxford, UK.

            "For instance, the International Union for Conservation of Nature, based in Gland, Switzerland, reported that more than one in three tree species is now at risk of extinction, and the conservation organization WWF, also based in Gland, reported that the average size of the globe\u2019s wildlife populations has declined by 73% in 50 years.",

            "\u201cWe are already at a tipping point, and the change to these ecosystems will be irreversible\u201d if action isn\u2019t taken, says Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, the global leader of climate and energy at the WWF.",
            "Yet many researchers were frustrated by what they saw as a lack of progress at COP16. By the close of the summit, only 44 of the 190-plus countries that signed the biodiversity deal two years ago had submitted action plans. And although around US$163 million was pledged in Cali to protect and restore nature, that amount is well short of the $200 billion per year that nations agreed will be needed to attain the goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s land and seas by 2030. ",
            "With nations not yet spending the sums required, there is growing pressure to seek funding from the private sector.",
            "h2Paying for knowledge",
            "For example, in the agreement to pay for genetic information from nature, otherwise known as digital sequence information (DSI), highly profitable companies are asked to contribute to the conservation \u2018Cali Fund\u2019. To be tapped for money, these firms have to hit two of three criteria: they must have $20 million in assets per year, make $50 million in sales per year or make $5 million in profit annually, averaged over the preceding three years. ",
            "\u201cConservation is mostly funded by governments and philanthropy,\u201d says Amber Hartman Scholz, head of the science-policy department at Leibniz Institute DSMZ in Braunschweig, Germany. \u201cNow businesses that profit from biodiversity will pay.\u201d",

            "\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d says Nathalie Seddon, an evolutionary ecologist at the University of Oxford. She is concerned that the agreement doesn\u2019t obligate businesses to pay into the fund and instead leaves it to governments to ensure compliance. But she points out a bright spot: half of the Cali Fund has been earmarked for Indigenous people and local communities, who are often the stewards of land rich in biodiversity. (Negotiators at COP16 also agreed to establish a subsidiary body for Indigenous communities to represent their interests in future biodiversity conservation decisions.)",
            "h2Putting a price on biodiversity",
            "There was much more controversy over discussions of another way to coax businesses to financially support biodiversity conservation: the sale of biodiversity credits.",
            "The idea is that companies could purchase biodiversity credits to improve their reputation, to ensure their own survival if they rely on nature-based products and to offset any harm that they are doing to Earth\u2019s species with their operations. The credits would, in turn, pay for conservation projects globally.",
            "How biodiversity credits could help to conserve and restore nature",
            "During COP16, the International Advisory Panel on Biodiversity Credits (IAPB) \u2014 a group of 25 specialists in business, conservation and finance from around the world \u2014 published its guidelines on how to establish and scale up the scheme. But the release was met with criticism.",
            "The plan has been compared with carbon credits, which companies can purchase to offset their release of greenhouse-gas emissions. Carbon credits have been derided for potential links to human-rights violations and for generating profits for intermediary businesses that sell the credits while failing to actually reduce emissions.",
            "\u201cGovernment donations are the only thing that\u2019s put significant amounts of money towards nature, and those efforts are getting diminished by talk of selling biodiversity credits, which are convoluted, unproven and have no demand,\u201d says Brian O\u2019Donnell, director of the environmental-advocacy organization Campaign for Nature, who is based in Durango, Colorado.",
            "According to a December 2023 report from the World Economic Forum, if biodiversity credits gain traction quickly like carbon credits, global demand for them could reach $2 billion per year by 2030 and $69 billion by 2050.",
            "IAPB member Simon Zadek, chief executive of NatureFinance \u2014 a non-profit organization in Geneva, Switzerland, that is working to increase the role of finance in conservation \u2014 argues that the \u201cdisgrace\u201d of voluntary carbon markets provides lessons that will make it possible to design a biodiversity-credit market that works. ",
            "For instance, says Zadek, the panel has recommended that there should be no secondary trading of biodiversity credits, as is done by intermediary companies in the carbon market. Instead, the panel proposes a national model in which businesses that damage nature are taxed by their government. The proceeds would buy national biodiversity credits to fund 20\u201325-year nature-restoration programmes.",
            "If the IAPB does not push the creation of a market for biodiversity credits, \u201cthere is a real risk\u201d that private firms, including those already involved in the carbon market, will go it alone with no oversight, Zadek says. This would \u201cgenerate a mess\u201d.",

After confirming that sugar intake had risen dramatically after the rations lifted, the team mined the biobank for people who had been conceived between October 1951 and June 1954, when the rations were in effect.

            "For the first time, chemists have made a class of molecules previously thought too unstable to exist, and used them to generate exotic compounds1. Scientists say these notorious molecules, known as anti-Bredt olefins (ABOs), offer a new path to synthesizing challenging drug candidates.",
            "The work is \u201ca landmark contribution\u201d, says Craig Williams, a chemist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. The findings are published in Science.",
            "Organic molecules, which contain carbon, typically conform to specific shapes because of the way their atoms bond together. For instance, olefins, also called alkenes \u2014 hydrocarbons that are often used in reactions for drug development \u2014 have one or more double bonds between two carbon atoms, resulting in the atoms being arranged in one plane.",
            "The 100-year-old Bredt\u2019s rule \u2014 which was proposed in 1924 by organic chemist Julius Bredt \u2014 states that, in small molecules made up of two rings that share atoms, such as some types of alkene, double bonds between two carbon atoms cannot occur where the rings join together, called the bridgehead position. This is because the bonds would force the molecule into a tortured, strained 3D shape that makes it highly reactive and unstable, says study co-author Neil Garg, a chemist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cStill, 100 years later, people would say these types of structures are forbidden or too unstable to make,\u201d he says.",
            "Although the rule has made its way into chemistry textbooks, it hasn\u2019t stopped researchers from trying to break it. Previous research has hinted that it\u2019s possible to create ABOs that have a double carbon\u2013carbon bond at the bridgehead position2. But attempts to synthesize them in their complete form were unsuccessful because the reaction conditions were too harsh, says Garg.",
            "h2Trapping agents",
            "In the latest attempt, Garg and his colleagues treated a precursor compound with a fluoride source to kick-start a milder \u2018elimination\u2019 reaction, which removes groups of atoms from molecules. This resulted in a molecule that had the telltale ABO double-carbon bond. When the researchers added various trapping agents \u2014 chemicals that capture unstable molecules as they react \u2014 to this 3D ABO, they were able to produce several complex compounds that could be isolated. This suggests that the reactions of ABOs with different trapping agents can be leveraged to synthesize 3D molecules, which are useful for designing new drugs, says Garg.",
            "Unlike typical alkenes, ABOs are chiral compounds \u2014 molecules that don\u2019t perfectly match up with their mirror image. Garg and his colleagues synthesized and trapped an ABO that was enantioenriched, which means they produced more of one mirroring pair than the other. This finding suggests that ABOs could be used as unconventional building blocks for enantioenriched compounds, which are widely used in pharmaceuticals.",

Because of the way the plant reproduces, this collection of aspens is technically all one tree, supported by a single, vast root system. Pando is triploid, meaning that its cells contain three copies of each chromosome, rather than two. As a result, Pando cannot reproduce sexually and mix its DNA with that of other trees, and instead creates clones of itself.",

Biologists are interested in these variations because they provide information on how the plant has changed since the first seedling sprouted.

            "Analysing the patterns of these mutations revealed surprising results. \u201cYou would expect that the trees that are spatially close are also closer genetically,\u201d says Pineau. \u201cBut this is not exactly what we find. We found a spatial signal, but that is much weaker than what we expected.\u201d Physically close trees did share more similar mutations than those that were far apart \u2014 but only slightly more. However, over a smaller scale of 1\u201315 metres the trend was stronger, with stems that were closer together having significantly more shared mutations. Pando covers an area of more than 40 hectares, \u201cbut it almost looks like it\u2019s a well-mixed pot of genetic information\u201d, says Ratcliff.",

            "The team also considered reasons for the tree\u2019s remarkable endurance. Pineau says that Pando being triploid might lead to \u201cbigger cells, bigger organisms, better fitness\u201d, and that existing clones might be more durable than new mixed offspring.",

He adds that future studies could search for this exact mechanism at the cellular level.",

Besides Trump\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the results of any election he doesn\u2019t win and his promises to use the powers of the federal government for political retribution, researchers fear that he just might succeed in reshaping the US government by replacing thousands of federal scientists with obedient political appointees.

            "\u201cTo address challenges in human medicine, we need to draw from a wide range of model systems,\u201d says Christine Charvet, a comparative neuroscientist at Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine in Alabama, who presented the work. \u201cCats, lemurs, mice are all useful. We shouldn\u2019t focus all our efforts on one.\u201d",
            "h2Age in dog years",
            "The Translating Time project started in the 1990s as a tool for developmental biologists1. Project scientists compiled data on how long it takes for the brain to reach a range of developmental milestones in a variety of mammals and used these data to graph the relative development of two species over time. This can help researchers to link observations of animal development to the corresponding human age.",
            "Ageing studies in five animals suggest how to reverse decline",
            "Over the years, however, as Charvet presented these data at conferences, researchers kept asking her to extend the database to include not only early development, but also how the brain changes as animals age.",
            "Scientists have long been frustrated with the limitations of standard laboratory models when it comes to understanding human ageing and its impact on the unique human brain. Mice live for only a few years \u2014 not long enough to accumulate much of the damage thought to drive some neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Mice might also possess mechanisms that humans lack for clearing clumps of misfolded proteins called plaques that are a hallmark of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, says Melissa Edler, a comparative neurobiologist at Kent State University in Ohio.",
            "The evolutionary mismatch between mice and men could be one reason why efforts to develop therapies to treat the disease have often fallen flat, says Elaine Guevara, who studies primate evolutionary genetics at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cMice don\u2019t develop the classic hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir brains are quite different to ours.\u201d",
            "h2Our pets, ourselves",
            "Companion animals could provide an alternative. They live longer than mice, share an environment with their owners and fall prey to human maladies, including obesity and diabetes. The Dog Aging Project, run by researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle and Texas A&M University in College Station, tracks tens of thousands of companion dogs to learn more about how their genetics, lifestyle and environment affect ageing.",
            "Does the human lifespan have a limit?",
            "But centuries of breeding have influenced ageing and disease in dogs, says Charvet. Cats often live a bit longer than dogs, she says, and are generally not as highly inbred for specific traits \u2014 some of which also raise disease risk.",
            "So Charvet and her colleagues have been gathering data from veterinary clinics and zoos, and launched an effort called the Catage Project that asks cat owners to submit data about their pets.",
            "So far, they have collected health records and results of blood sample analyses from thousands of felines and taken brain scans of more than 50. Using their own data and the published literature, the team is filling in events along the nonlinear relationship between cat and human ages. A one-year-old cat, for example, is roughly equivalent to an 18-year-old human. But in the next year, a cat ages only about 4 \u2018human years\u2019, to become about as mature as a 22-year-old person.",
            "By the age of 15, a cat is an octogenarian in human years. Some cats experience cognitive decline by then, and the brain scans collected by the team reveal brain volume changes in older cats that mirror those seen in older humans, says Charvet. Previous work has also shown that cats can accumulate plaques and tangles of abnormal proteins similar to those that characterize Alzheimer\u2019s disease in humans.",
            "h2Multiple models",
            "Ultimately, researchers might develop a variety of model systems for different aspects of ageing and neurodegeneration, says Edler. Although mice are poor models for some aspects of human ageing, they will still be valuable, because it is so easy for researchers to conduct genetic experiments with the rodents, she says.",
            "Other animals, such as cats or certain nonhuman primates, might be better models for other aspects of brain ageing. Caleb Finch, who studies the evolution of life history at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, advocates more study of naked mole rats (Heterocephalus glaber), which live surprisingly long for small rodents and have very low rates of cancer.",
            "\u201cCats are useful,\u201d says Charvet. \u201cBut they\u2019re only going to be so useful. Other model systems are needed as well.\u201d",

            "How farming could become the ultimate climate-change tool",
            "Experimental evidence is accumulating, they say, that by improving soil health, crops can be made more resilient to drought and extreme weather \u2014 and they want governments to offer financial incentives to farmers who use \u2018regenerative\u2019 practices to climate-proof farmland. These agricultural practices include boosting the soil microbiome \u2014 that is, its microbial community \u2014 by rotating crops between fields, rather than repeatedly planting the same crop in the same field, and by adding \u2018cover crops\u2019 to fields. These comprise plants that won\u2019t necessarily be harvested, but that prevent soil erosion and boost soil nutrients.",
            "\u201cThere are lots of ripple effects from the changing climate that are creating challenges for our food system,\u201d says Rob Myers, the director of the Center for Regenerative Agriculture at the University of Missouri in Columbia. \u201cThe ways we combat that are with biological diversity, more organic matter in the soil \u2014 and more integrated approaches.\u201d",
            "But switching to such practices requires upfront investment. Researchers and farmers who spoke to Nature say that regenerative agriculture does work, but it can take a few years of implementing it before farms start to see a profit. In the United States, advocates are calling on the US Congress to include more subsidies for regenerative agriculture in the Farm Bill, a massive piece of legislation that is updated every five years or so and includes funding for disaster aid and farmer training. The most recent version expired on 30 September. Meanwhile, the latest version of the European Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy entered into force last year, and included funding for farmers using these types of sustainable practice.",
            "h2Nurturing the soil",
            "Industrial agriculture usually relies on fertilizers, pesticides and mechanical equipment to produce high-yielding monocultures \u2014 single crops such as maize (corn) or wheat. Excessive use of chemicals on these crops disrupts ecological processes in the soil and is one of the leading causes of water pollution in the United States. Unhealthy soil struggles to soak up water or retain nutrients.",
            "CRISPR-edited crops break new ground in Africa",
            "An estimated 8,505 million tonnes of topsoil on US farmland was lost to erosion between 2013 and 2017. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warns that more than 90% of Earth\u2019s soils are at risk of becoming degraded by 2050; this could lead to a rise in famine.",
            "Regenerative agriculture lacks a formal definition, but scientists who spoke to Nature say that its general goal is to rebuild healthy soil. That starts with increasing the proportion of organic matter \u2014 including living roots and manure \u2014 to feed the soil microbiome and recycle nutrients for plants. ",
            "Although the term is modern, regenerative principles are ancient. Implementing them means \u201creturning to some of the practices that we\u2019ve relied upon as a human species for thousands of years\u201d, says Rich Smith, an agricultural ecologist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham.",
            "h2Keeping cover",
            "One practice that is considered regenerative is cover cropping: planting species that typically won\u2019t be harvested, such as crimson clover, when the cash crop is out of season instead of leaving the soil bare. Roots from the cover crop prevent erosion and take up excess nitrate from fertilizers that would otherwise leach into streams and groundwater. When a farmer cuts down the cover crop to prepare for the next round of cash-crop planting, they work it into the soil where it feeds the bacteria and invertebrates underground, improving soil fertility. Only about 5% of cultivated land in the United States was cover cropped in 2022, but that figure has been increasing: by 2022 it was 17% higher than in 2017.",

            "During a major drought that destroyed maize and soya bean crops across the US Midwest in 2012, Myers heard farmers say that cover-cropped fields hadn\u2019t been hit as hard as fields without the extra plants. So he worked with the Conservation Technology Information Center, a non-profit organization in West Lafayette, Indiana, that promotes conservation in agriculture, and a sustainable farming programme funded by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the National Cover Crop Survey. Researchers polled roughly 700 farmers, and found an average 9.6% greater maize yield and 11.6% greater soya bean yield during the drought on fields in which cover crops had been grown. ",
            "This was surprising, because \u201cat the time, many people thought that cover crops would take moisture away\u201d and not leave any for the cash crops, Myers says.",
            "The USDA has offered subsidies to farmers who use cover crops. Of the farmers who responded to the 2022\u201323 National Cover Crop Survey and had received payments to plant cover crops, 90% said that they would probably continue the practice after the funding stopped. ",
            "h2Valuing variety",
            "There is also evidence that crop rotation can improve soil health and resilience. Swapping out crops, rather than growing the same monoculture on the same field for years on end, can improve soil health without sacrificing productivity, Smith says.",
            "Eat less meat: will the first global climate deal on food work?",
            "This can be done by rotating different crops, including cover crops, on the same field over time, or by planting several crops on the same field at the same time, including the \u2018three sisters\u2019 trio of maize, beans and squash that has been grown by some Native American tribes for centuries. ",
            "A review of 20 studies that analysed the effects of crop rotation on soil life found that rotating various species increased the amount of microorganisms in soil by about 15% compared with monoculture fields, and boosted microbial diversity by more than 3%1. Rotating two or more different crops also generates more of the nutrients carbon and nitrogen in soil than does monoculture2. A review of 33 papers that assessed fields in which legumes and grains were grown together revealed an increase in the stability of yields year-to-year compared with those of monoculture fields3, suggesting that biodiverse farms could improve food security. ",
            "\u201cThose types of systems can often be more resilient to weather variation and have some enhanced disease resistance,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe evidence is relatively strong that they maintain, if not increase, yields.\u201d ",

When he got started with regenerative agriculture at the industrial operation he inherited, he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a safety net to fall back on\u201d, he says. Government subsidies \u201cincentivized me to try some things, and I\u2019ve gained a tremendous amount of knowledge because of that\u201d.",
            "Federal, state and business programmes that incentivize cover cropping usually stop after farmers make the transition. To support producers supplying the nation\u2019s food who institute these practices over the long term, the US Farm Bill should include a measure to reduce farmers\u2019 federal crop insurance premiums, Kaufman and others say. The USDA trialled this idea during the COVID-19 pandemic by offering farmers who planted cover crops an insurance discount of US$5.00 per acre. The federal programme has now ended, but states including Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois have implemented their own versions.",
            "Farms can move away from industrial agricultural practices and move towards healthier soil, Kaufman says. \u201cIt just takes time\u201d and financial incentives to get producers to change, he says.

She says that during past events \u2014 such as a mining-dam collapse in the state of Minas Gerais in 2019 \u2014 there was an overdiagnosis of mental-health disorders in the initial period after the disaster, when such reactions should be considered normal.",
            "As a result, people began to see themselves as traumatized victims, which can be disempowering and weaken their sense of community, she says. \u201cWhen the community comes together, organizes collective efforts and demands their rights, that is also a form of mental-health action. But if you individualize suffering with a diagnosis, you assume that it\u2019s now every person for themselves, and that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d",
            "And that is why those who provide care should avoid referring to \u2018symptoms\u2019 and instead talk about \u2018expected reactions\u2019 when discussing difficulty sleeping, anxiety and other common outcomes of a traumatic event, says Noal. \u201cWe guide people to self-monitor and only seek help if the issues persist. They need to utilize their own coping strategies; otherwise, they risk becoming dependent on health-care professionals.\u201d",

            "In the first 48 hours after a trauma, the use of benzodiazepines \u2014 commonly used to treat anxiety \u2014 is contraindicated, Hauck says. They are known to impair the consolidation of traumatic memories and increase the risk of PTSD.",
            "It\u2019s also important to consider that strategies and instruments created to address mental-health issues arising from disasters in high-income countries might not work in other settings. When Hauck and her colleagues tried to apply international standardized mental-health-screening questionnaires to people in shelters during the floods, they noticed that some people did not understand questions that researchers considered to be simple, but which contained words that were not easily understood by a vulnerable population with lower levels of education. \u201cSo, we need to think about how to include these people and adapt the questions,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cWhen we transpose instruments that are developed in the US and Europe to our context, we always wonder why it didn\u2019t work,\u201d says Kapczinski. Researchers in Rio Grande do Sul are now developing an app to estimate mental-health symptoms in disasters. The researchers plan to launch the app in Portuguese, Spanish and English so it can be deployed in other countries, especially in low- and middle-income ones.",

            "Eliana Silva de Ara\u00fajo had already lost her home when the May floods hit Rio Grande do Sul. Her house in the Taquari Valley region in the central part of the state was destroyed by a large flood that struck the area in September 2023. Then, in May, the school where she, her daughter and granddaughter were taking refuge was inundated, forcing them and hundreds of people who had already been displaced to relocate to a new shelter.",
            "In Porto Alegre, many displaced people were able to return to their houses after the water receded, but in the Taquari Valley region some neighbourhoods were completely wiped out and are no longer considered safe to live in. And as a result, shelters in that area are still crowded: there simply aren\u2019t enough houses for the displaced families.",

            "As a microcosm of society, the shelters are affected by problems such as violence and alcohol and drug misuse, contributing to the mental-health toll of the disaster. Adding to that, Ara\u00fajo says that her neighbours discriminate against her because she is from Bahia, a lower-income state in the northeast of Brazil.",
            "\u201cWhat affects me the most is not even the floods, it\u2019s the people,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt really bad after the last flood because of the prejudice; I was really struggling.\u201d",

            "One of the neighbourhoods wiped out by the flooding was Passo de Estrela in Cruzeiro do Sul, where Joelson de Moraes Ferreira is a psychologist at the city\u2019s main health-care clinic. In a group therapy session with women from the community, he asked them to write down all their memories of the lost neighbourhood in a notebook.",
            "\u201cOne of them brought up that the church where she got married and later baptized her children doesn\u2019t exist any more. And even the photographs of these events were lost, so she is losing that memory,\u201d he says, his voice choked with emotion.",
            "In a workshop organized by Ferreira a few months ago, the participants were asked to share what they would like to happen to Passo de Estrela, knowing that they will not be able to live there again. \u201cUnanimously, they said they would like to see it as a public space with parks and trees, where they could go to take walks, see friends and drink chimarr\u00e3o [a regional tea].\u201d",

            "Researchers say that social support and resilience \u2014 the ability to adapt and recover from adversity \u2014 are important to prevent depression and PTSD after disasters. Yet, the literature in this area remains limited. So Lidia Maria Erbes, a master\u2019s student in psychology at the University of Taquari Valley, decided to study whether people affected by the floods who had more social support and resilience developed fewer mental-health symptoms than did their peers. She created a questionnaire that is being sent out to people across the valley and hopes to have the results by the end of the year.",
            "The goal is to assess the mental-health impact of the floods and identify potential protective factors, says Joana Bucker, Erbes\u2019s adviser on the project. \u201cThis will allow us to think of strategies for intervention in the future,\u201d she says.",
            "Social support was essential for Jardim and his mother, Jurema, as they rebuilt their lives after the flood waters had drained away. When he reached out for help, 18 friends arrived one Saturday morning to form a clean-up task force. In days, the house was ready for their return. As I left their home on a rainy morning months after the flood, I noticed the vibrant foliage in their planters. When I asked if these plants had survived the floods, Jurema shook her head.",
