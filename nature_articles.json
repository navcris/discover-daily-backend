            "Endosymbiotic relationships \u2014 in which a microbial partner lives harmoniously within the cells of another organism \u2014 are found in numerous life forms, including insects and fungi. Scientists think that mitochondria, the organelles that are responsible for cells\u2019 energy production, evolved when a bacterium took up residence inside an ancestor of eukaryotic cells. Chloroplasts emerged when an ancestor of plants swallowed a photosynthetic microorganism.",
            "Determining the factors that formed and sustained these couplings is difficult because they occurred so long ago. To get around this problem, a team led by microbiologist Julia Vorholt, at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich), has spent the past few years engineering endosymbioses in the laboratory. Their approach uses a 500-1000 nanometre wide needle to puncture host cells and then deliver bacterial cells one at a time.",

            "Even with this technical wizardry, initial pairings tended to fail; for instance, because the would-be symbiont divided too fast and killed its host2. The team\u2019s luck changed when they recreated a natural symbiosis that occurs between some strains of a fungal plant pathogen, Rhizopus microsporus, and the bacterium Mycetohabitans rhizoxinica, which produces a toxin that protects the fungus from predation.",

After piercing the wall with the needle, the researchers used a bicycle pump \u2014 and later an air compressor \u2014 to maintain enough pressure to deliver the bacteria.",
            "After overcoming the initial shock of surgery, the fungi continued their life cycles and produced spores, a fraction of which contained bacteria. When these spores germinated, bacteria were also present in the cells of the next generation of fungi. This showed that the new endosymbiosis could be passed onto offspring \u2014 a key finding.",

            "But the germination success of the bacteria-containing spores was low. In a mixed population of spores (some with bacteria and some without), those with bacteria vanished after two generations. To see whether relations could be improved, the researchers used a fluorescent cell sorter to select spores containing bacteria \u2014 which had been labelled with a glowing protein \u2014 and propagated only these spores in future rounds of reproduction. By ten generations, the bacteria-containing spores germinated nearly as efficiently as those without bacteria.",
            "The basis of this adaptation isn\u2019t clear. Genome sequencing identified a handful of mutations associated with improved germination success in the fungus \u2014 which was a strain of R. microsporus not known to carry endosymbionts naturally \u2014 and found no changes in the bacteria.",

            "Mpox vaccines used in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States did not materialize in Africa, even during a global outbreak of the disease in 2022, says Nicaise Ndembi, a virologist at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa. This year, however, doses have begun to arrive, after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public-health emergency for the second time in history.",
            "On 17 September, Rwandan health officials began administering jabs to those at high risk of infection; the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has been the African country hardest hit by the disease, will follow suit on 5 October; and Nigeria is set to start its own vaccinations in the next two weeks.",

            "These developments come as African countries report more than 31,400 suspected mpox infections and 844 deaths in 2024. They also come as a new strain of the virus that causes mpox, called clade Ib, has spread in densely-populated regions and partly through sexual contact, meaning that it can transmit from person to person efficiently.",
            "It isn\u2019t yet known how effective the vaccines being handed out will be against clade I virus \u2014 they helped during the global outbreak two years ago, but that crisis was driven by a different strain called clade IIb. Still, many scientists emphasize that they are safe and expect them to work.",
            "Here, Ndembi, who is coordinating Africa CDC\u2019s mpox response, talks about how health officials plan to distribute the new doses and the challenges they will face.",

            "We are doing much better. There are about 275,000 doses that we currently have on hand, and they have already been dispatched to countries for administering. In the 2022 pandemic, we didn\u2019t get a single dose of vaccine.",
            "If you put together the pledges and what\u2019s already been delivered, there are about 6.1 million doses coming. But you can\u2019t vaccinate with pledges: the 10,000 doses that Nigeria received in 2024 were actually pledged in 2022. So you can see the disparities. But to now have 6.1 million doses pledged is incredible. Now, we need to see them materialize.",
            "We\u2019re looking at vaccinating 10 million people [in Africa], but that number might need to be as high as 14 or 15 million.",
            "h2Until more doses arrive, how will countries prioritize who gets shots first?",
            "This is not a vaccination campaign. The messaging around the word, \u2018campaign\u2019, connotes that everyone can get a shot. But we\u2019re going to be very targeted. We\u2019re hoping to reach specific groups, and we are envisaging that this approach could create problems within the community if we don\u2019t communicate properly who is most at risk of infection and why we\u2019re prioritizing certain groups. We see that many people are waiting for the vaccine \u2014 it\u2019s a silver bullet to many. The stigma coming with mpox [which causes visible, fluid-filled lesions among other symptoms] means everyone wants to get vaccinated.",
            "As an example of prioritizing specific groups, Rwanda has started vaccination, and it\u2019s very targeted among female sex workers and among cross-border traders, truck drivers and healthcare workers \u2014 those at high risk [of infection]. We will also use a \u2018ring vaccination\u2019 approach: we will identify close contacts of infected people, and those are who you\u2019d want to be sure to vaccinate first.",
            "h2The DRC is contending with outbreaks of multiple strains of virus \u2014 clade Ib, as well as clade Ia, which typically has spread to people through infected animals. Will that affect how vaccines are distributed?",
            "We will start with the hotspots: the provinces that are most affected are going to be selected in the first bloc, and then subsequently we will move on to other areas.",
            "For the different subtypes of the virus, I want to be very clear: viruses don\u2019t have boundaries. We have to move away from the idea that we could confine an [mpox] subtype in a geographic area. [DRC\u2019s capital city] Kinshasa has both clade Ia and Ib.",
            "We\u2019re not going to say \u2018let\u2019s start vaccinating the clade Ib areas and then go to the Ia areas\u2019. That would be too complex.",

            "Kinshasa is the entry and exit point for almost all travellers [coming through the region]. There\u2019s definitely worry, because infections there can easily be transported anywhere in the world.",
            "h2How will you monitor the effectiveness of the vaccines as people receive them?",
            "We have a team already in Rwanda that is working to ensure that we monitor for adverse events and that over time those vaccines are effective. They will study the immunogenicity, safety and effectiveness, as well as durability [how long the vaccine\u2019s effects last].",
            "[Editor\u2019s note: one clinical trial will aim to recruit more than 1,500 people over the age of 10 in the DRC, Uganda and Nigeria with confirmed mpox infections to understand if the vaccines can reduce the risk of their contacts developing the disease or lessen the severity of their illness.]",
            "h2What would success look like?",
            "In the DRC, we\u2019re dealing with a country of 100 million people. We\u2019re talking about over 30,000 suspected cases \u2014 and consider, how many people are even able to get tested? Currently, about 40% of suspected cases get tested, and about 60% of those are positive. That means we\u2019re not testing a lot, and we still have people out there that are moving with the virus who don\u2019t even know they\u2019re infected.",
            "You are controlling an epidemic when new cases stop coming from the contacts of those who you know are infected. Vaccines are meant to help break those chains of transmission \u2014 so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be looking for.",
            "But vaccination is just one of the tools in the response: risk communication, community engagement, laboratory [infrastructure] are equally important.",
            "h2What has been most difficult about controlling this outbreak?",
            "First, mpox is endemic in some parts of Africa. Within the DRC, there are provinces that have been reporting cases for decades. We don\u2019t have enough tools to rapidly detect the virus. For HIV, you have five minutes, you get the test done, and the result is 99% accurate. If we had a test [like we do with HIV], that would be fantastic.",
            "The other challenge is drugs. Tecovirimat [an antiviral against mpox] worked for clade II during the 2022 pandemic, but it has been shown to be less effective on the African population in the DRC. And lastly, we haven\u2019t had enough vaccines. This is a very strong case for local manufacturing across the continent: we need to start making the diagnostic kits, the drugs and even the vaccines here.",

            "A fruit fly might not be the smartest organism, but scientists can still learn a lot from its brain. Researchers are hoping to do that now that they have a new map \u2014 the most complete for any organism so far \u2014 of the brain of a single fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The wiring diagram, or \u2018connectome\u2019, includes nearly 140,000 neurons and captures more than 54.5 million synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells.",
            "\u201cThis is a huge deal,\u201d says Clay Reid, a neurobiologist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington, who was not involved in the project but has worked with one of the team members who was. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the world has been anxiously waiting for, for a long time.\u201d",
            "The map1 is described in a package of nine papers about the data published in Nature today. Its creators are part of a consortium known as FlyWire, co-led by neuroscientists Mala Murthy and Sebastian Seung at Princeton University in New Jersey.",
            "h2A long road",
            "Seung and Murthy say that they\u2019ve been developing the FlyWire map for more than four years, using electron microscopy images of slices of the fly\u2019s brain. The researchers and their colleagues stitched the data together to form a full map of the brain with the help of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools.",
            "But these tools aren\u2019t perfect, and the wiring diagram needed to be checked for errors. The scientists spent a great deal of time manually proofreading the data \u2014 so much time that they invited volunteers to help. In all, the consortium members and the volunteers made more than three million manual edits, according to co-author Gregory Jefferis, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. (He notes that much of this work took place in 2020, when fly researchers were at loose ends and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.)",
            "\n",
            "But the work wasn\u2019t finished: the map still had to be annotated, a process in which the researchers and volunteers labelled each neuron as a particular cell type. Jefferis compares the task to assessing satellite images: AI software might be trained to recognize lakes or roads in such images, but humans would have to check the results and name the specific lakes or roads themselves. All told, the researchers identified 8,453 types of neuron \u2014 much more than anyone had expected. Of these, 4,581 were newly discovered, which will create new research directions, Seung says. \u201cEvery one of those cell types is a question,\u201d he adds.",
            "The team was surprised by some of the ways in which the various cells connect to one another, too. For instance, neurons that were thought to be involved in just one sensory wiring circuit, such as a visual pathway, tended to receive cues from multiple senses, including hearing and touch1. \u201cIt\u2019s astounding how interconnected the brain is,\u201d Murthy says.",
            "h2Exploring the map",
            "The FlyWire map data have been available for the past few years for researchers to explore. This has enabled scientists to learn more about the brain and about fruit flies \u2014 findings that are captured in some of the papers published in Nature today.",
            "\n\nCubic millimetre of brain mapped in spectacular detail\n",
            "In one paper2, for example, researchers used the connectome to create a computer model of the entire fruit-fly brain, including all the connections between neurons. They tested it by activating neurons that they knew either sense sweet or bitter tastes. These neurons then launched a cascade of signals through the virtual fly\u2019s brain, ultimately triggering motor neurons tied to the fly\u2019s proboscis \u2014 the equivalent of the mammalian tongue. When the sweet circuit was activated, a signal for extending the proboscis was transmitted, as if the insect was preparing to feed; when the bitter circuit was activated, this signal was inhibited. To validate these findings, the team activated the same neurons in a real fruit fly. The researchers learnt that the simulation was more than 90% accurate at predicting which neurons would respond and therefore how the fly would behave.",
            "In another study3, researchers describe two wiring circuits that signal a fly to stop walking. One of these contains two neurons that are responsible for halting \u2018walk\u2019 signals sent from the brain when the fly wants to stop and feed. The other circuit includes neurons in the nerve cord, which receives and processes signals from the brain. These cells create resistance in the fly\u2019s leg joints, allowing the insect to stop while it grooms itself.",
            "One limitation of the new connectome is that it was created from a single female fruit fly. Although fruit-fly brains are similar to each other, they are not identical. Until now, the most complete connectome for a fruit-fly brain was a map of a \u2018hemibrain\u2019 \u2014 a portion of a fly\u2019s brain containing around 25,000 neurons. In one of the Nature papers out today4, Jefferis, Davi Bock, a neurobiologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington, and their colleagues compared the FlyWire brain with the hemibrain.",
            "Some of the differences were striking. The FlyWire fly had almost twice as many neurons in a brain structure called the mushroom body, which is involved in smell, compared with the fly used in the hemibrain-mapping project. Bock thinks the discrepancy could be because the hemibrain fly might have starved while it was still growing, which harmed its brain development.",
            "The FlyWire researchers say that much work remains to be done to fully understand the fruit-fly brain. For instance, the latest connectome shows only how neurons connect through chemical synapses, across which molecules called neurotransmitters send information. It doesn\u2019t offer any information about electrical connectivity between neurons or about how neurons chemically communicate outside synapses. And Murthy hopes to eventually have a male fly connectome, too, which would allow researchers to study male-specific behaviours such as singing. \u201cWe\u2019re not done, but it\u2019s a big step,\u201d Bock says.",

The three individuals from China are the first people with autoimmune disorders to be treated with engineered immune cells created from donor cells, rather than ones collected from their own bodies. This advance is the first step towards mass production of such therapies.",
            "One of the recipients, Mr Gong, a 57-year-old man from Shanghai, has systemic sclerosis, which affects connective tissue and can result in skin stiffening and organ damage. He says that three days after receiving the therapy, he felt his skin loosen and he could start moving his fingers and opening his mouth again. Two weeks later, he returned to his office job. \u201cI feel very good,\u201d he says, more than a year after receiving the treatment.",
            "Engineered immune cells, called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have shown great promise in treating blood cancers \u2014 half a dozen products are approved in the United States \u2014 and potential for treating autoimmune conditions such as lupus and multiple sclerosis, in which rogue immune cells release autoantibodies that attack the body\u2019s own tissue. But the therapy typically relies on a person\u2019s own immune cells, and this personalization makes it expensive and time consuming.",
            "That\u2019s why researchers have started creating CAR T therapies from donated immune cells. If successful, they would allow pharmaceutical companies to scale up manufacturing, potentially slashing costs and production times. Instead of making one treatment for one person, therapies for more than a hundred people could be made from one donor\u2019s cells, says Lin Xin, an immunologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Donor-derived CAR T cells have been used to treat people with cancers, but with limited success so far2.",

            "The trial, led by Xu Huji, a rheumatologist at Naval Medical University in Shanghai, is the first to report results for autoimmune diseases. They were published in Cell last month. More than six months after receiving the treatment, the recipients remained in remission. Another two dozen individuals have received the donor-derived treatment and a slightly modified product, says Xu. The results have been largely positive, he says.",
            "\u201cThe clinical outcomes are phenomenal,\u201d says Lin, who is leading a separate trial using donor-derived CAR T cells to treat lupus.",
            "The success and safety of the therapy look promising but still need to be demonstrated in many more people before researchers can draw conclusions about its broad application, says Christina Bergmann, a rheumatologist at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany.",
            "But if it does succeed in more people over a longer time frame, it \u201ccould prove paradigm shifting\u201d, says Daniel Baker, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. More than 80 autoimmune diseases are linked to malfunctioning immune cells.",
            "h2Healthy donor",
            "CAR-T-cell therapy typically involves extracting immune cells known as T cells from the person being treated. The cells are embellished with CAR proteins that target B cells and are then re-infused into the person\u2019s body.",
            "The process for creating CAR T cells from donated immune cells is similar. Xu and his colleagues extracted T cells from a 21-year-old woman and studded them with CARs that recognize CD19, a receptor found on the surface of B cells. They used the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene-editing tool to knock out five genes in the T cells, to prevent both the grafted cells from attacking the host\u2019s body and the host\u2019s immune system from attacking the donor cells.",
            "The first person to receive the treatment, in May 2023, was a 42-year-old woman with a type of autoimmune myopathy, which targets skeletal muscle tissue, resulting in weakness and fatigue. Mr Gong, and another man aged 45, had an aggressive form of sclerosis. They started their treatments in June and August 2023.",
            "Once injected into the hosts, the CAR T cells got to work. They multiplied and targeted and destroyed all the B cells \u2014 including pathogenic cells linked to the autoimmune conditions. The bioengineered T cells survived for weeks in the recipients before largely vanishing. Eventually, new healthy B cells returned, but no pathogenic ones did. A similar response has been observed in people with autoimmune conditions who received CAR T cells derived from their own cells3.",
            "h2\u2018Complete remission\u2019",
            "Two months after the treatment, the researchers say the woman achieved complete remission, and maintained that status at her six-month follow-up. Baker says that although the woman showed clear clinical improvements, he would be more cautious about calling it complete remission, given the short assessment time. The woman\u2019s autoantibodies had dropped to undetectable levels, and her muscle strength and mobility had improved dramatically.",
            "The two men also saw significant improvements in their symptoms \u2014 including the reversal of scar-tissue formation \u2014 and declines in autoantibody levels.",
            "None of the individuals experienced an extreme inflammatory reaction known as cytokine-release syndrome, which has been observed in some people with cancer who have received CAR-T therapy, and they didn\u2019t show evidence of the graft attacking the host. But the researchers are still trying to determine whether the host\u2019s body rejects the graft over time.",
            "One key safety concern observed in some people who have received CAR-T-cell therapy to treat cancer is the emergence of new tumours, although researchers are still investigating whether they are linked to the therapy. Baker says it\u2019s too early to know whether people with autoimmune conditions who are treated with donor-derived CAR T cells will face this risk. \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201c",
            "The big question now, Baker says, is whether the same approach will work in more people, and how durable the effects will be. \u201cWill these patients stay symptom-free for years?\u201d",

Why animals in the southern region have so far escaped infection is a mystery, but scientists have several theories.",
            "For one, Australia is geographically isolated and doesn\u2019t import live poultry, says Frank Wong, a virologist at the CSIRO Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong. Many of the countries\u2019 birds are endemic and do not migrate to regions where the virus is spreading.",
            "But the virus\u2019s arrival in Australia is \u201ca matter of when, not if\u201d, says Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne, Australia.",
            "h2Bird survey",
            "Wille thinks that long-distance migratory shorebirds and seabirds that come from Siberia and Alaska through southeast Asia to Australia are most likely to carry the virus into the country.",
            "This week, Australian scientists, including Wille, started swabbing the first of nearly 1,000 migratory birds for the virus. Over the coming weeks, the team will capture wedge-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica) and short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) as they migrate from the northern autumn to the southern spring. At night, shearwaters sleep in burrows and are relatively easy to grab. The researchers will swab the birds for the virus, and take blood to test for antibodies that will reveal previous exposure. They will be testing for the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in particular, which has caused mass mortality in birds and some mammals.",
            "To swab the birds, the researchers will travel to seven locations across Australia, as far apart as Broome in the northwest, Lord Howe Island in the east and Phillip Island in the south.",
            "h2Deadly ducks?",
            "Wille says another possible route for the virus is through ducks. Scientists think migrating ducks and geese in other parts of the world can spread the disease without succumbing to it.",
            "That\u2019s because ducks\u2019 epithelial cells have a sensor, known as RIG-I, that detects an invading influenza virus and triggers an immune response that usually fends it off. Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, says ducks might have evolved such defences in Asia from repeated infections with many less-pathogenic forms of the virus, giving them pre-existing immunity. Although they don\u2019t get sick from H5N1, they can still pass it on, and ducks congregate in lakes and ponds with other birds, increasing the chances of disease spread.",
            "h2Isolated ecosystems",
            "Another reason that Oceania is currently free of the virus is that the region\u2019s ducks are endemic and they don\u2019t tend to migrate overseas.",
            "This isolation is partly explained by a biogeographical division called the Wallace Line, first described by naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859, which runs through Indonesia. Many animal species tend to stay on one side of the line or the other, and because of this isolation, the fauna on each side are distinct. Michael Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, describes this phenomenon as \u201cone of the great mysteries\u201d of the world.",
            "The sharp division might also mean that the virus is not adapted to animals east of the Wallace Line, says Wong. \u201cAvian influenza viruses, including this high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus, are particularly well-adapted to certain species,\u201d he says. Birds in Australia could have a genetic make-up that circumvents the usual infection route for the virus, but no one has yet tested this hypothesis.",
            "Although many duck species are short-distance migratory birds and tend not to cross the Wallace Line, some species \u2014 including Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa) and spotted whistling duck (Dendrocygna guttata) \u2014 do, and Wille thinks they could introduce H5N1 to the region.",
            "If the virus is detected, government veterinarians will immediately move in to cull the affected population, which happened when H7N3 and H7N9 strains of the flu were detected in Victoria in May.",
            "Short says that, when it happens, the effect on Australia\u2019s birds, mammals and ecosystems is unknown, but many species are probably susceptible. \u201cIt\u2019s a big research gap,\u201d she says.",

            "\u201cThe Rwandan health authorities are exceptionally capable, and I hope that they will be able to rapidly contain this outbreak,\u201d Feinberg adds. \u201cThe risk of extension of the outbreak to adjacent countries is not insignificant and the consequences of this could be severe.\u201d",
            "The fact that clinical-trial plans are in place and that other groundwork has been laid increases the odds that Marburg vaccines and treatments will be used in Rwanda, says Nancy Sullivan, a viral immunologist at Boston University in Massachusetts. But it\u2019s likely that data on Marburg vaccines and treatments will be needed from multiple outbreaks before conclusions can be drawn about their effectiveness.",

            "Narrative CVs are gaining in popularity \u2014 but many researchers don\u2019t yet know exactly how to craft one.Credit: Getty",
            "A group of funding agencies and research organizations has created a free online platform to help academics to create narrative CVs.",
            "In the past few years, funders have increasingly favoured the narrative style over typical formats, which usually emphasize quantitative indicators. These include the titles of journals that papers are published in, and the amount of grant money received. Narrative CVs describe a person\u2019s contributions and achievements, and reflect a broader range of skills and experiences than do conventional formats.",
            "The Peer Exchange Platform for Narrative-style CVs (PEP-CV) is backed by a coalition of national funders that are already using narrative CVs in funding applications. These include UK Research and Innovation, the Swiss National Science Foundation, Science Foundation Ireland, the Dutch Research Council and the Luxembourg National Research Fund.",
            "Other PEP-CV supporters include London-based research funder Wellcome; the Young Academy of Europe (YAE), a Europe-wide association of junior researchers; and the Marie Curie Alumni Association, an international non-profit organization.",
            "It\u2019s difficult to understand a person\u2019s expertise by looking only at quantitative metrics, says YAE chair Katalin Solymosi, a plant biologist at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in Budapest.",
            "\u201cIf you want to change the research culture, and also build a more inclusive scientific landscape with equity, diversity and inclusion of all talents, there should be greater awareness among funders of more qualitative indicators,\u201d Solymosi says.",
            "Narrative CVs can help funders to see the human being behind a funding application. They can capture periods of parental leave, for example, which are harder to account for in conventional CV formats, she adds.",
            "\u201cBut many researchers have no experience with how to write narrative CVs, what to include, and how to avoid it becoming a very lengthy text that nobody will really read,\u201d Solymosi concludes. This is why mentoring support is needed, she says.",
            "h2A sea change for CVs",
            "Individual researchers can register on PEP-CV as mentors or people seeking advice. Those seeking a mentor can then search for one who best fits their needs. If that person accepts the request, the two are connected through e-mail. Since its launch in March, the platform has garnered around 500 users, 153 mentors and 348 seeking guidance.",
            "Tanita Casci, who directs the research strategy and policy unit at the University of Oxford, UK, says that a mentoring platform such as PEP-CV can help researchers who do not have much local support to find guidance on how to craft their CV.",
            "Because knowledge of this CV format is not yet widespread, she adds, it means that \u201crather than the narrative CV achieving its intended aims of allowing for greater diversity in applicant pools and awardee pools, it\u2019s actually favouring those who are in institutions that have the appropriate support\u201d.",
            "Future plans include incentivizing mentors to offer their time for free by allowing them to claim recognition using ORCID, a tool that assigns unique identifiers to authors to capture bibliometric outputs. This will enable them to earn credit for their work.",
            "Kelly Cobey, who leads the metascience and open-science programme at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, says a change in behaviour is needed to shift in how research is assessed, and narrative CVs are part of that process.",
            "Currently, grant applicants don\u2019t always know what funders are looking for in narrative CVs, which is why more mentoring support is a positive step, Cobey adds.",
            "In addition to guidance on crafting CVs, Casci thinks institutions should support researchers by making sure they are participating in relevant activities to gain knowledge and experiences that they can eventually write about.",
