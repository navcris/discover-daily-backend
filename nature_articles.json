            "One woman and two men with severe autoimmune conditions have gone into remission after being treated with bioengineered and CRISPR-modified immune cells1. The three individuals from China are the first people with autoimmune disorders to be treated with engineered immune cells created from donor cells, rather than ones collected from their own bodies. This advance is the first step towards mass production of such therapies.",
            "One of the recipients, Mr Gong, a 57-year-old man from Shanghai, has systemic sclerosis, which affects connective tissue and can result in skin stiffening and organ damage. He says that three days after receiving the therapy, he felt his skin loosen and he could start moving his fingers and opening his mouth again. Two weeks later, he returned to his office job. \u201cI feel very good,\u201d he says, more than a year after receiving the treatment.",
            "Engineered immune cells, called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, have shown great promise in treating blood cancers \u2014 half a dozen products are approved in the United States \u2014 and potential for treating autoimmune conditions such as lupus and multiple sclerosis, in which rogue immune cells release autoantibodies that attack the body\u2019s own tissue. But the therapy typically relies on a person\u2019s own immune cells, and this personalization makes it expensive and time consuming.",
            "That\u2019s why researchers have started creating CAR T therapies from donated immune cells. If successful, they would allow pharmaceutical companies to scale up manufacturing, potentially slashing costs and production times. Instead of making one treatment for one person, therapies for more than a hundred people could be made from one donor\u2019s cells, says Lin Xin, an immunologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Donor-derived CAR T cells have been used to treat people with cancers, but with limited success so far2.",
            "h2Autoimmune diseases",
            "The trial, led by Xu Huji, a rheumatologist at Naval Medical University in Shanghai, is the first to report results for autoimmune diseases. They were published in Cell last month. More than six months after receiving the treatment, the recipients remained in remission. Another two dozen individuals have received the donor-derived treatment and a slightly modified product, says Xu. The results have been largely positive, he says.",
            "\u201cThe clinical outcomes are phenomenal,\u201d says Lin, who is leading a separate trial using donor-derived CAR T cells to treat lupus.",
            "The success and safety of the therapy look promising but still need to be demonstrated in many more people before researchers can draw conclusions about its broad application, says Christina Bergmann, a rheumatologist at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany.",
            "But if it does succeed in more people over a longer time frame, it \u201ccould prove paradigm shifting\u201d, says Daniel Baker, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. More than 80 autoimmune diseases are linked to malfunctioning immune cells.",
            "h2Healthy donor",
            "CAR-T-cell therapy typically involves extracting immune cells known as T cells from the person being treated. The cells are embellished with CAR proteins that target B cells and are then re-infused into the person\u2019s body.",
            "The process for creating CAR T cells from donated immune cells is similar. Xu and his colleagues extracted T cells from a 21-year-old woman and studded them with CARs that recognize CD19, a receptor found on the surface of B cells. They used the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene-editing tool to knock out five genes in the T cells, to prevent both the grafted cells from attacking the host\u2019s body and the host\u2019s immune system from attacking the donor cells.",
            "The first person to receive the treatment, in May 2023, was a 42-year-old woman with a type of autoimmune myopathy, which targets skeletal muscle tissue, resulting in weakness and fatigue. Mr Gong, and another man aged 45, had an aggressive form of sclerosis. They started their treatments in June and August 2023.",
            "Once injected into the hosts, the CAR T cells got to work. They multiplied and targeted and destroyed all the B cells \u2014 including pathogenic cells linked to the autoimmune conditions. The bioengineered T cells survived for weeks in the recipients before largely vanishing. Eventually, new healthy B cells returned, but no pathogenic ones did. A similar response has been observed in people with autoimmune conditions who received CAR T cells derived from their own cells3.",
            "h2\u2018Complete remission\u2019",
            "Two months after the treatment, the researchers say the woman achieved complete remission, and maintained that status at her six-month follow-up. Baker says that although the woman showed clear clinical improvements, he would be more cautious about calling it complete remission, given the short assessment time. The woman\u2019s autoantibodies had dropped to undetectable levels, and her muscle strength and mobility had improved dramatically.",
            "The two men also saw significant improvements in their symptoms \u2014 including the reversal of scar-tissue formation \u2014 and declines in autoantibody levels.",
            "None of the individuals experienced an extreme inflammatory reaction known as cytokine-release syndrome, which has been observed in some people with cancer who have received CAR-T therapy, and they didn\u2019t show evidence of the graft attacking the host. But the researchers are still trying to determine whether the host\u2019s body rejects the graft over time.",
            "One key safety concern observed in some people who have received CAR-T-cell therapy to treat cancer is the emergence of new tumours, although researchers are still investigating whether they are linked to the therapy. Baker says it\u2019s too early to know whether people with autoimmune conditions who are treated with donor-derived CAR T cells will face this risk. \u201cOnly time will tell.\u201c",
            "The big question now, Baker says, is whether the same approach will work in more people, and how durable the effects will be. \u201cWill these patients stay symptom-free for years?\u201d",

            "Mpox has spread to 15 African countries in 2024, six of which had never seen a single case of the disease, leaving health officials scrambling to contain the continent\u2019s deadliest mpox surge to date. But they finally have a new tool to help \u2014 vaccines \u2014 which have not previously been available in Africa despite mpox being detected on the continent decades ago.",
            "Mpox vaccines used in wealthy nations such as Germany and the United States did not materialize in Africa, even during a global outbreak of the disease in 2022, says Nicaise Ndembi, a virologist at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa. This year, however, doses have begun to arrive, after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public-health emergency for the second time in history.",
            "On 17 September, Rwandan health officials began administering jabs to those at high risk of infection; the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has been the African country hardest hit by the disease, will follow suit on 5 October; and Nigeria is set to start its own vaccinations in the next two weeks.",

            "These developments come as African countries report more than 31,400 suspected mpox infections and 844 deaths in 2024. They also come as a new strain of the virus that causes mpox, called clade Ib, has spread in densely-populated regions and partly through sexual contact, meaning that it can transmit from person to person efficiently.",
            "It isn\u2019t yet known how effective the vaccines being handed out will be against clade I virus \u2014 they helped during the global outbreak two years ago, but that crisis was driven by a different strain called clade IIb. Still, many scientists emphasize that they are safe and expect them to work.",
            "Here, Ndembi, who is coordinating Africa CDC\u2019s mpox response, talks about how health officials plan to distribute the new doses and the challenges they will face.",
            "h2Are the doses you\u2019re receiving what you would have expected as part of an equitable global response during the 2022 global outbreak?",
            "We are doing much better. There are about 275,000 doses that we currently have on hand, and they have already been dispatched to countries for administering. In the 2022 pandemic, we didn\u2019t get a single dose of vaccine.",
            "If you put together the pledges and what\u2019s already been delivered, there are about 6.1 million doses coming. But you can\u2019t vaccinate with pledges: the 10,000 doses that Nigeria received in 2024 were actually pledged in 2022. So you can see the disparities. But to now have 6.1 million doses pledged is incredible. Now, we need to see them materialize.",
            "We\u2019re looking at vaccinating 10 million people [in Africa], but that number might need to be as high as 14 or 15 million.",
            "h2Until more doses arrive, how will countries prioritize who gets shots first?",
            "This is not a vaccination campaign. The messaging around the word, \u2018campaign\u2019, connotes that everyone can get a shot. But we\u2019re going to be very targeted. We\u2019re hoping to reach specific groups, and we are envisaging that this approach could create problems within the community if we don\u2019t communicate properly who is most at risk of infection and why we\u2019re prioritizing certain groups. We see that many people are waiting for the vaccine \u2014 it\u2019s a silver bullet to many. The stigma coming with mpox [which causes visible, fluid-filled lesions among other symptoms] means everyone wants to get vaccinated.",
            "As an example of prioritizing specific groups, Rwanda has started vaccination, and it\u2019s very targeted among female sex workers and among cross-border traders, truck drivers and healthcare workers \u2014 those at high risk [of infection]. We will also use a \u2018ring vaccination\u2019 approach: we will identify close contacts of infected people, and those are who you\u2019d want to be sure to vaccinate first.",
            "h2The DRC is contending with outbreaks of multiple strains of virus \u2014 clade Ib, as well as clade Ia, which typically has spread to people through infected animals. Will that affect how vaccines are distributed?",
            "We will start with the hotspots: the provinces that are most affected are going to be selected in the first bloc, and then subsequently we will move on to other areas.",
            "For the different subtypes of the virus, I want to be very clear: viruses don\u2019t have boundaries. We have to move away from the idea that we could confine an [mpox] subtype in a geographic area. [DRC\u2019s capital city] Kinshasa has both clade Ia and Ib.",
            "We\u2019re not going to say \u2018let\u2019s start vaccinating the clade Ib areas and then go to the Ia areas\u2019. That would be too complex.",
            "h2You mentioned Kinshasa, where both clade I strains are spreading. How concerning is this?",
            "Kinshasa is the entry and exit point for almost all travellers [coming through the region]. There\u2019s definitely worry, because infections there can easily be transported anywhere in the world.",
            "h2How will you monitor the effectiveness of the vaccines as people receive them?",
            "We have a team already in Rwanda that is working to ensure that we monitor for adverse events and that over time those vaccines are effective. They will study the immunogenicity, safety and effectiveness, as well as durability [how long the vaccine\u2019s effects last].",
            "[Editor\u2019s note: one clinical trial will aim to recruit more than 1,500 people over the age of 10 in the DRC, Uganda and Nigeria with confirmed mpox infections to understand if the vaccines can reduce the risk of their contacts developing the disease or lessen the severity of their illness.]",
            "h2What would success look like?",
            "In the DRC, we\u2019re dealing with a country of 100 million people. We\u2019re talking about over 30,000 suspected cases \u2014 and consider, how many people are even able to get tested? Currently, about 40% of suspected cases get tested, and about 60% of those are positive. That means we\u2019re not testing a lot, and we still have people out there that are moving with the virus who don\u2019t even know they\u2019re infected.",
            "You are controlling an epidemic when new cases stop coming from the contacts of those who you know are infected. Vaccines are meant to help break those chains of transmission \u2014 so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be looking for.",
            "But vaccination is just one of the tools in the response: risk communication, community engagement, laboratory [infrastructure] are equally important.",
            "h2What has been most difficult about controlling this outbreak?",
            "First, mpox is endemic in some parts of Africa. Within the DRC, there are provinces that have been reporting cases for decades. We don\u2019t have enough tools to rapidly detect the virus. For HIV, you have five minutes, you get the test done, and the result is 99% accurate. If we had a test [like we do with HIV], that would be fantastic.",
            "The other challenge is drugs. Tecovirimat [an antiviral against mpox] worked for clade II during the 2022 pandemic, but it has been shown to be less effective on the African population in the DRC. And lastly, we haven\u2019t had enough vaccines. This is a very strong case for local manufacturing across the continent: we need to start making the diagnostic kits, the drugs and even the vaccines here.",

            "To assess how much of the land was covered with vegetation, the researchers took advantage of the properties of growing plants: healthy plants absorb a lot of red light and reflect a lot of near-infrared light. Scientists can use satellite measurements of light at these wavelengths to determine whether a piece of land is covered by thriving plants.",
            "The team found that the area of the peninsula swathed in plants grew from less than one square kilometre in 1986 to nearly 12 square kilometres in 2021 (see \u2018An icy land goes green\u2019). The rate of expansion was roughly 33% higher between 2016 and 2021 compared with the four-decade study period as a whole.",

As mosses spread to previously ice-covered landscapes, they will build up a layer of soil, offering a habitat for other plant life, Roland says. \u201cThere's a huge potential here to see a further increase in the amount of non-native, potentially invasive species,\u201d he says.",

And, although research from the MIT team and others continues to build a solid scientific foundation for this unconventional strategy, some groups have not managed to replicate their findings in mice.",

In individuals with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, these gamma waves, which are crucial for processes such as attention and memory, were weaker than those of cognitively healthy individuals2.",

But Olshansky and others have long argued that this rate of improvement is not sustainable, despite more-optimistic forecasts that predict most children born in the twenty-first century would live for a 100 years or more2. But this is difficult to confirm, because the only way to be sure is to wait for enough people to die, or not.",
            "With his colleagues, Olshansky first published the idea3 that human life expectancy has a finite limit in 1990. \u201cWe have waited 30 years to test this,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we now have definitive evidence that the limited lifespan hypothesis is correct.\u201d",

The decline in the United States is driven by increasing numbers of deaths because of conditions such as diabetes and heart disease in people aged roughly 40 to 60.",

Many of the countries\u2019 birds are endemic and do not migrate to regions where the virus is spreading.",
            "But the virus\u2019s arrival in Australia is \u201ca matter of when, not if\u201d, says Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne, Australia.",

            "Wille thinks that long-distance migratory shorebirds and seabirds that come from Siberia and Alaska through southeast Asia to Australia are most likely to carry the virus into the country.",
            "This week, Australian scientists, including Wille, started swabbing the first of nearly 1,000 migratory birds for the virus. Over the coming weeks, the team will capture wedge-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica) and short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) as they migrate from the northern autumn to the southern spring. At night, shearwaters sleep in burrows and are relatively easy to grab. The researchers will swab the birds for the virus, and take blood to test for antibodies that will reveal previous exposure. They will be testing for the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in particular, which has caused mass mortality in birds and some mammals.",

            "h2Deadly ducks?",
            "Wille says another possible route for the virus is through ducks. Scientists think migrating ducks and geese in other parts of the world can spread the disease without succumbing to it.",
            "That\u2019s because ducks\u2019 epithelial cells have a sensor, known as RIG-I, that detects an invading influenza virus and triggers an immune response that usually fends it off. Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, says ducks might have evolved such defences in Asia from repeated infections with many less-pathogenic forms of the virus, giving them pre-existing immunity. Although they don\u2019t get sick from H5N1, they can still pass it on, and ducks congregate in lakes and ponds with other birds, increasing the chances of disease spread.",
            "h2Isolated ecosystems",
            "Another reason that Oceania is currently free of the virus is that the region\u2019s ducks are endemic and they don\u2019t tend to migrate overseas.",
            "This isolation is partly explained by a biogeographical division called the Wallace Line, first described by naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859, which runs through Indonesia. Many animal species tend to stay on one side of the line or the other, and because of this isolation, the fauna on each side are distinct. Michael Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, describes this phenomenon as \u201cone of the great mysteries\u201d of the world.",
            "The sharp division might also mean that the virus is not adapted to animals east of the Wallace Line, says Wong. \u201cAvian influenza viruses, including this high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus, are particularly well-adapted to certain species,\u201d he says. Birds in Australia could have a genetic make-up that circumvents the usual infection route for the virus, but no one has yet tested this hypothesis.",
            "Although many duck species are short-distance migratory birds and tend not to cross the Wallace Line, some species \u2014 including Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa) and spotted whistling duck (Dendrocygna guttata) \u2014 do, and Wille thinks they could introduce H5N1 to the region.",
            "If the virus is detected, government veterinarians will immediately move in to cull the affected population, which happened when H7N3 and H7N9 strains of the flu were detected in Victoria in May.",
            "Short says that, when it happens, the effect on Australia\u2019s birds, mammals and ecosystems is unknown, but many species are probably susceptible. \u201cIt\u2019s a big research gap,\u201d she says.",

            "The \u20ac363-million (US$398-million) mission is a follow-up to NASA\u2019s DART, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test. In September 2022, the similarly sized DART spacecraft slammed into Dimorphos, the smaller of the two asteroids at 160 metres across. That impact shortened the period of the asteroid\u2019s nearly 12-hour orbit around Didymos by 33 minutes (see \u2018Impact assessment\u2019). That\u2019s strong evidence that space agencies could, in future, use a similar approach to deflect an asteroid on course with Earth, say researchers. No such asteroid is currently known.",

That means comparisons of Dimorphos\u2019s form before and after impact are more difficult.",

About 15% of asteroids are thought to be binaries. \u201cOne of the mysteries about binary asteroids is they\u2019re predicted to fall apart really quickly,\u201d she says, because of radiation pressure from the Sun.

Previously, it had been tidally locked, with the same face always pointing towards its larger companion, as the Moon does Earth.

If the mass is low, \u201cthen maybe we deflected it so easily because it was light\u201d, says Michel. But if the mass is high, it suggests that DART\u2019s approach was even more effective at pushing the asteroid off course.",

The results in mice fit well with an emerging picture from studies of postmortem human brains. These efforts, too, have found that age affects metabolism in the brain, says Maura Boldrini, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City who was not involved in the latest research. \u201cProbably their metabolism is less efficient than it used to be,\u201d she says, adding that both the human results and the mouse study, published today in Nature, \u201copen new avenues for potential therapeutics.\u201d",

Her team is now looking to see whether production of new neurons is altered in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or psychiatric illnesses. But some researchers have reported that they could not find evidence that adults make new neurons in the hippocampus. \u201cThis controversy is still continuing,\u201d Boldrini says.",

            "In mice, the picture is clearer. Neural stem cells in a region of the brain called the subventricular zone can give rise to neurons and other types of cells. These young cells then migrate to the olfactory bulb, which controls the sense of smell. A steady supply of fresh neurons to the olfactory bulb makes sense in mice, because they rely heavily on smell to perceive changes in their environment, says Anne Brunet, a geneticist who studies ageing at Stanford University in California and who is an author of the new study.",
            "As mice age, however, those stem cells become less active. Brunet and her colleagues decided to find out why.

            "In the past few years, funders have increasingly favoured the narrative style over typical formats, which usually emphasize quantitative indicators. These include the titles of journals that papers are published in, and the amount of grant money received. Narrative CVs describe a person\u2019s contributions and achievements, and reflect a broader range of skills and experiences than do conventional formats.",

If that person accepts the request, the two are connected through e-mail. Since its launch in March, the platform has garnered around 500 users, 153 mentors and 348 seeking guidance.",
            "Tanita Casci, who directs the research strategy and policy unit at the University of Oxford, UK, says that a mentoring platform such as PEP-CV can help researchers who do not have much local support to find guidance on how to craft their CV.",
            "Because knowledge of this CV format is not yet widespread, she adds, it means that \u201crather than the narrative CV achieving its intended aims of allowing for greater diversity in applicant pools and awardee pools, it\u2019s actually favouring those who are in institutions that have the appropriate support\u201d.",
            "Future plans include incentivizing mentors to offer their time for free by allowing them to claim recognition using ORCID, a tool that assigns unique identifiers to authors to capture bibliometric outputs. This will enable them to earn credit for their work.",

            "In addition to guidance on crafting CVs, Casci thinks institutions should support researchers by making sure they are participating in relevant activities to gain knowledge and experiences that they can eventually write about.",
