            "The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought to the fore ethical questions that were once confined to the realms of science fiction: if AI systems could one day \u2018think\u2019 like humans, for example, would they also be able to have subjective experiences like humans? Would they experience suffering, and, if so, will humanity be equipped to properly care for them? ",
            "A group of philosophers and computer scientists are arguing that AI welfare should be taken seriously. In a report posted last month on the preprint server arXiv1, ahead of peer review, they call for AI companies to not only assess their systems for evidence of consciousness and the capacity to make autonomous decisions, but also to put in place policies for how to treat the systems if these scenarios become reality.",
            "If AI becomes conscious: here\u2019s how researchers will know",
            "They point out that failing to recognize that an AI system has become conscious could lead people to neglect it, harming it or causing it to suffer.",
            "Some think that, at this stage, the idea that there is a need for AI welfare is laughable. Others are sceptical, but say it doesn\u2019t hurt to start planning. Among them is Anil Seth, a consciousness researcher at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. \u201cThese scenarios might seem outlandish, and it is true that conscious AI may be very far away and might not even be possible. But the implications of its emergence are sufficiently tectonic that we mustn\u2019t ignore the possibility,\u201d he wrote last year in the science magazine Nautilus. \u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t that Frankenstein\u2019s creature came to life; it was that it was conscious and could feel.\u201d",
            "The stakes are getting higher as we become increasingly dependent on these technologies, says Jonathan Mason, a mathematician based in Oxford, UK, who was not involved in producing the report. Mason argues that developing methods for assessing AI systems for consciousness should be a priority. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be sensible to get society to invest so much in something and become so reliant on something that we knew so little about \u2014 that we didn\u2019t even realize that it had perception,\u201d he says.",
            "People might also be harmed if AI systems aren\u2019t tested properly for consciousness, says Jeff Sebo, a philosopher at New York University in New York City and a co-author of the report. If we wrongly assume a system is conscious, he says, welfare funding might be funnelled towards its care, and therefore taken away from people or animals that need it, or \u201cit could lead you to constrain efforts to make AI safe or beneficial for humans\u201d.",
            "h2A turning point?",
            "The report contends that AI welfare is at a \u201ctransitional moment\u201d. One of its authors, Kyle Fish, was recently hired as an AI welfare researcher by the AI firm Anthropic, based in San Francisco, California. This is the first such position of its kind designated at a top AI firm, according to authors of the report. Anthropic also helped to fund initial research that led to the report. \u201cThere is a shift happening because there are now people at leading AI companies who take AI consciousness and agency and moral significance seriously,\u201d Sebo says.",

            "A year from now, children under the age of 16 in Australia will be barred from many social-media platforms \u2014 the highest minimum-age limit in the world. Other countries or regions have introduced similar bans and more say they\u2019re considering them, owing to parents\u2019 concerns that children are exposed to cyber-bullying, scams and adult content on these platforms. But researchers say there is minimal evidence to suggest such bans will keep children safe from online harm.",
            "The Australian government says that social media is impacting children\u2019s wellbeing. It hasn\u2019t said which platforms will be off-limits under the new law, but the legislation will include those that allow users to post content and interact with two or more users on a platform, such as Snapchat, TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). Social-media companies could face fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$32 million) if they don\u2019t take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to prevent children younger than the minimum age from signing up for accounts.",
            "Many parents have applauded the tough approach, but researchers aren\u2019t convinced banning access to social media will solve the problems it is intended to address. In October, dozens of researchers penned a letter to the Australian government arguing that a blanket ban was too blunt and that addressing online risks requires a nuanced, evidence-based approach.",
            "There is a lack of evidence to suggest that a ban will be effective, says Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who focuses on how social media influences mental health. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the scientific consensus,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Evidence so far",
            "So what does the research show? A 2023 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that social media has the potential to be harmful to adolescent health, but that there is not enough evidence to suggest that it causes negative effects at the population level. Rather than bringing in blanket bans and age restrictions, the report recommends that social-media companies adopt new standards to improve the platforms\u2019 transparency, as well as better reporting systems to tackle online abuse.",
            "Australia is one of several countries or regions to attempt to impose social-media restrictions on children. In 2023, France introduced a law that prohibits children under the age of 15 from signing up for social-media accounts without parental consent, although it is yet to be enforced. The US state of Florida signed a bill in March that seeks to ban social-media accounts for children younger than 14 years old, but the move is being challenged in the district court over concerns about free speech. And in October, Norway announced plans to increase the minimum age for social-media use from 13 to 15 years old.",
            "Studies suggest that children are already finding ways around existing age limits. A 2022 report by the UK government\u2019s Office of Communications found that 60% of children aged between 8 and 11 who use these platforms have their own profiles, despite most platforms having an age limit of 13 years old. Furthermore, young users do not need an account to browse some social-media sites, such as TikTok, and can use their parents\u2019 logins to access content on more restrictive sites, says Stephanie Wescott, a researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on gender-based violence in schools. \u201cThere are huge enforceability issues,\u201d she says.",
            "h2Online community",
            "Because few jurisdictions have banned social media for children, few studies have explored whether such restrictions protect children against online harassment, bullying and harmful content. There is, however, evidence that social media offers adolescents some benefits.",
            "In a 2022 survey conducted in the United States by the Pew Research Center, based in Washington DC, roughly 80% of 13\u201317-year-olds surveyed said that social media made them feel more connected to what\u2019s happening in their friends\u2019 lives. Among the 32% of respondents who reported that social media has a mostly positive impact on them, almost half cited connections and socializing as the main reasons. Almost 60% said that social media had a neutral effect on them, whereas only 9% found it mostly negative.",
            "For some children, particularly those in minority groups and those living in remote areas, social media is a \u201clifeline\u201d, because it gives them access to communities and support systems they might not have at home or at school, says Lisa Given, an information scientist at RMIT University in Melbourne who specializes in human behaviour. Australia\u2019s tough social-media restrictions could isolate these children. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need many more interventions in terms of support and care for those kids who are now banned from these platforms,\u201d she says.",
            "Przybylski worries that the country\u2019s blunt approach will only push vulnerable children to corners of the Internet where they are more likely to be exposed to harm, such as unmoderated chat rooms.",
            "Westcott says governments should focus on educating children from an early age about the pitfalls of social media and how to navigate the online world more critically.",

However, these quantum-information states are notoriously delicate, explains Julian Kelly, a physicist at Google who leads the company\u2019s quantum-hardware division. To get a quantum computer to perform useful calculations, \u201cyou need quantum information, and you need to protect it from the environment \u2014 and from ourselves, as we do manipulations on it\u201d, he says.",
            "Aiming for such protection \u2014 without which quantum computing would be a non-starter \u2014 theoreticians began in 1995 to develop ingenious schemes for spreading one qubit of information across multiple \u2018physical\u2019 qubits. The resulting \u2018logical qubit\u2019 is resilient to noise \u2014 at least on paper. For this technique, called quantum error correction, to work in practice, it would be necessary to show that this spreading of information over multiple qubits robustly lowered error rates. ",
            "Over the past few years, several companies \u2014 including IBM and Amazon\u2019s AWS \u2014 and academic groups have shown that error correction can produce small improvements in accuracy2,3,4.

Milei\u2019s agenda to reduce the country\u2019s deficit and lower inflation \u2014 which had topped 211% last year \u2014 has meant that, as his administration\u2019s slogan says, \u201cthere is no money\u201d for science or anything else.",

He adds that the Innovation, Science and Technology Secretariat, once the country\u2019s main science ministry but downgraded by Milei to a secretariat with less power, is working with a budget that is one-third lower than last year.",
            "Argentinian scientists who are paid by the government have lost up to 30% of their income, Geffner says. (As of 2022, the government funded about 60% of research and development in Argentina, and the rest came from the private sector and international contributions.) As a result, the country is facing massive brain drain. At INBIRS, about half of its staff members are either considering finding jobs in other countries or already doing the paperwork, Geffner adds.",
            "\u201cWith six more months like this, there will be nothing left\u201d of the scientific community, says Mariano Cantero, director of the Balseiro Institute in Bariloche, Argentina, which trains physicists and engineers.",

Argentina\u2019s gross domestic product is expected to shrink by 3.5% by the end of 2024, but recover by 5% in 2025.",
            "The slashing of budgets has hit science particularly hard. The National Agency for the Promotion of Research, Technological Development and Innovation, which is the main funder of research projects in Argentina, has nearly halted work under Milei, despite 85% of its money coming from international agencies such as the Inter-American Development Bank. Alicia Caballero, who was president of the agency, resigned in September because the government did not authorize her to use the agency\u2019s budget.",

In a letter and in public interviews, Garc\u00eda Sol\u00e1 said that Milei\u2019s government was reviewing research projects on an ideological basis \u2014 for instance evaluating them for signs of communism and other \u2018deviations\u2019 \u2014 and rejecting them if they didn\u2019t align with the government\u2019s political agenda.",

            "Since Milei took office, CONICET has lost at least 140 full-time workers, mainly administrative personnel, and has awarded only about half of the research grants that it did in previous years. A recent estimate from a group of university-based researchers in Argentina suggests that the agency has overall lost about 1,000 workers, including interns and contractors such as scientists and technicians.",
            "Officials at CONICET did not answer Nature\u2019s queries by the time this story was published.",
            "Another way that some scientists say they feel belittled by Milei is the President\u2019s stance on climate change. Milei has repeatedly said that he doesn\u2019t think that humans are causing global warming and that what the world is experiencing is instead part of a natural cycle, despite an abundance of scientific evidence to the contrary. On government websites and in official documents, the situation is labelled \u201cclimate variation\u201d rather than climate change.",

The move came hours after he spoke with US president-elect Donald Trump, who has signalled that he will remove the United States from such negotiations when he takes office next month. Trump and Milei have expressed mutual admiration for each other.",

            "It was, perhaps, an unusual source of excitement for a PhD student. But Kharas had waited a long time to see the contents of those stuffy, bureaucratic pages: the biggest pay rise in 20 years for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers across Canada. The budget included huge boosts to both the number and value of government scholarships. \u201cThere was absolute excitement and giddiness when I saw those numbers,\u201d she says.",
            "",
            "It was the culmination of a years-long campaign; Kharas had been leading the project for the past six months.",
            "The Support Our Science (SOS) campaign began in 2022. From the start, organizers knew it needed to be led by graduate students speaking in their own voice, says Marc Johnson, a biologist at the University of Toronto Mississauga who helped to launch the campaign.",
            "SOS\u2019s first executive director was Sarah Laframboise, a PhD student at the University of Ottawa. When she stepped down in November 2023, Johnson and the board chose Kharas, who was doing a PhD in paediatric brain cancer at the University of Toronto, as her replacement. \u201cKaitlin had distinguished herself as professional, well spoken and up to date on the issues,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cShe and Sarah have been our face and voice, and the people who put our vision into action.\u201d",
            "The campaign involved rallies, meetings with cabinet ministers and e-mail campaigns. In the months leading up to the budget, the campaign held a press conference and encouraged supporters to write to the prime minister and finance minister. But Kharas says one of the most effective events was the nationwide walkout in May 2023. After the government failed to increase scholarship amounts in the 2023 budget, some 10,000 researchers at 46 institutions across the country stopped working in protest.",
            "Kharas helped to organize the walkouts at local institutions, and met with finance minister Chrystia Freeland, outside whose office the Toronto protest had gathered. \u201cIt was my favourite moment of the campaign,\u201d says Kharas.",
            "Stagnating investment in basic research and increases in the cost of living have provoked a crisis for early-career researchers, who are finding their work perilous for both their finances and their mental health.",
            "The nationwide salary boost that Kharas and SOS achieved is rare, but other actions by researchers have been successful at local levels. In the United States, for instance, union action helped postdoc researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City to get a pay rise this year. Widespread strikes helped to bring about a pay increase for researchers at the University of California in 2022. At the national level, the US National Institutes of Health raised salaries for graduate students and postdocs across the board in April, following recommendations from a working group.",
            "Kharas thinks the SOS campaign succeeded because it aligned its arguments with the priorities of Canada\u2019s present government \u2014 highlighting the economic contributions of research and the diversity of the graduate-student community.",

            "R\u00e9mi Lam had heard about San Francisco\u2019s microclimates, but he didn\u2019t realize how idiosyncratic they could be until he moved there this year. \u201cThe street I live in can be foggy, and it\u2019s sunny two blocks down,\u201d he says. Weather forecasts for the city can be wildly incorrect depending on the location. Even state-of-the-art weather forecasts can\u2019t predict the city\u2019s microclimates and how they will vary.",
            "Lam has spent a lot of time thinking about weather and how to forecast it. As a researcher at Google DeepMind, the artificial intelligence (AI) firm based in London, Lam has been pioneering the use of machine learning to improve weather prediction. This field has made rapid advances in the past few years, and Lam and his colleagues have been at the forefront of these efforts.",
            "",
            "They\u2019re not alone. A number of groups are racing to develop AI-aided weather forecasts, including those at Microsoft, Nvidia, Huawei and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in Reading, UK. But for much of this year, the leading AI in terms of accuracy was a project called GraphCast, led by Lam (R. Lam et al. Science 382, 1416\u20131421; 2023).",
            "\u201cGraphCast raised the bar up in terms of skill of forecasting,\u201d says Matthew Chantry, who leads research on AI-based weather prediction at the ECMWF.",
            "Conventional weather forecasts are sophisticated programs that simulate the evolution of Earth\u2019s atmosphere on the basis of known physics of how air, heat and water vapour move around the planet. GraphCast is an artificial neural network that is shaped like a grid covering the globe. Lam and his collaborators \u2018trained\u2019 it with data based on real atmospheric measurements, but without giving it any explicit knowledge of physical laws. Still, the AI forecasts were by many measures better than the conventional ones. \u201cI was surprised it outperformed the physics-based forecasts so quickly \u2014 I thought it would take longer,\u201d says Lam.",

            "Early this year, cases of mpox erupted across Central Africa, killing hundreds. Seeing the events unfold so soon after the still-simmering outbreak of 2022 \u201cfelt like scientific amnesia\u201d, says Placide Mbala, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).",
            "Mbala led a team of researchers who sounded the alarm about the latest outbreak when they spotted a suspicious cluster of mpox cases among young adults and sex workers in an eastern region of the DRC. The team predicted that the disease would move quickly and urged health officials both in the DRC and in neighbouring countries to devise plans to contain the monkeypox virus\u2019s spread.",
            "",
            "He and his colleagues analysed the genome of the virus (E. H. Vakaniaki et al. Nature Med. 30, 2791\u20132795; 2024), revealing that it was a new strain, capable of passing from human to human and distinct from the virus that caused the 2022 outbreak and other previous outbreaks in the DRC. It has since been detected in Sweden, Thailand, India, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and six African countries that had never before reported mpox infections.",
            "Mbala has been instrumental in leading these research projects, says Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, who collaborates with Mbala. Furthermore, Mbala has \u201cbeen coordinating response and community-engagement activities across the country, and doing all this in the least selfish, most diplomatic and democratic ways\u201d, Kindrachuk adds.",
            "It\u2019s a role that Mbala has long trained for. After finishing medical school in 2006 and spending a year as a clinician in Kinshasa, he met Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, a microbiologist who directs the centre where Mbala works. Mbala was impressed by Muyembe-Tamfum\u2019s work \u2014 in particular his dogged efforts to find the animal reservoir of Ebola, having co-discovered the Ebola virus in 1976. Muyembe-Tamfum took Mbala under his wing, and in 2008 they worked to improve the country\u2019s capacity for mpox testing and treatment. Later, Mbala helped to diagnose and confirm, through genetic sequencing, the first infections with the Ebola virus during the DRC\u2019s 2014 outbreak.",
            "\u201cHe\u2019s leaving quite the legacy, and he\u2019s really fitting the shoes of his mentor,\u201d says Nicaise Ndembi, a virologist at the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Addis Ababa, who is coordinating the agency\u2019s 2024 mpox response.",
            "For Mbala, it is his personal mission to put an end to the scientific amnesia that allowed conditions such as mpox to linger and re-emerge. He says that the world knew what the monkeypox virus was capable of, and yet, once infections outside Africa dropped below a certain level, the disease became neglected once again. Vaccines and therapeutics that many high-income countries deployed to control the 2022 outbreaks remained out of reach of African nations until last September \u2014 when the strain had already spread aggressively throughout the continent.",
            "Mbala aims to better understand how the disease spreads in the DRC and neighbouring countries. His team has found that the virus can spread rampantly in displacement camps and through non-sexual contact; previously, mpox in Central Africa caused small, localized outbreaks and was known to spread to people only through contact with infected animals (D. Mukadi-Bamuleka et al. Preprint at medRxiv https://doi.org/g8dxrz; 2024).",

            "Ekkehard Peik thought it would take only a few months to create the basic ingredients of a radical new clock. That was back in 2001, when he and his colleague Christian Tamm proposed a device with the potential to be even more precise and portable than the world\u2019s best atomic clocks.",
            "Peik\u2019s estimate was off by more than two decades. But this year, his team and two other groups managed to finally achieve what he and Tamm had proposed, generating the first tick of a clock based on tiny energy shifts inside an atomic nucleus.",
            "",
            "The world\u2019s best atomic clocks rely on the energy transitions of electrons that orbit an atomic nucleus. These clocks are so accurate that they gain or lose only a second every 40 billion years.",
            "Peik and Tamm, both physicists at the PTB, Germany\u2019s national metrology institute in Braunschweig, came up with the idea of a nuclear approach. \u201cWe thought we could very quickly do a kind of demonstration experiment,\u201d says Peik. For more than a year, they tried different ways to nudge nuclei of radioactive thorium-229 into an excited state. Then they would need to tune a laser to the energy of the nuclei\u2019s transition and eventually use its frequency to mark time. \u201cBut the experiments all failed,\u201d he says. The pair published their unproven proposal in 2003 (E. Peik and C. Tamm Europhys. Lett. 61, 181; 2003).",
            "Tamm later retired but Peik kept at the problem. His perseverance paid off this year when his was the first of three groups to excite the nucleus to make it \u2018tick\u2019. There is still a way to go before this kind of system can replace the most precise clocks. But a starting gun has been fired. \u201cNow everybody wants a piece,\u201d says Thorsten Schumm, an atomic physicist and Peik\u2019s collaborator at the Vienna University of Technology.",
            "Peik always found precision clocks fascinating. He was thrilled by their fusion of fundamental physics and practical applications. The idea of creating an entirely new kind of clock came when his PTB colleague, metrologist Uwe Sterr, noted a quirk in the nuclear physics literature. Studies showed that the thorium-229 nucleus must have a strangely low-energy excited state \u2014 one so low that it would be possible to induce that transition with a precision laser. For nuclear physicists, this transition was a curiosity. But Peik and Tamm saw that they could use it to make a clock. \u201cIt was quite logical for us to follow up,\u201d says Peik. \u201cNobody had done this.\u201d",
            "Immersing himself in nuclear physics, Peik soon realized that a thorium-229 clock would have a raft of advantages. Not only could a nuclear clock be more precise than atomic clocks, it would also be more robust, because the nucleus is less sensitive to electromagnetic fields than electrons are.",
            "To make it work, they had to find the transition energy. They got creative, zapping thorium with lamps, lasers and high-powered radiation to jolt its nuclei into a higher energy state. But each method failed. Even so, they learnt something with every attempt. That was enough to keep them going, says Peik.",
            "Schumm, who joined the effort in 2010, credits Peik for trusting his own ideas. \u201cA different character would not have come so far.\u201d",
            "Triumph came thanks to the pair expanding the project into a Europe-wide consortium involving a range of approaches. Still trying ideas from the 2003 paper, Schumm\u2019s lab set about embedding trillions of atoms of thorium-229 in a crystal, to boost the transition signal so that it would be easier to detect. Meanwhile, Peik\u2019s lab built an ultraviolet laser that could excite the nucleus.",
