            "Scientists in Boston, Massachusetts have made reprogrammed stem cells from the blood of centenarians. They plan to share the cells with other researchers to better understand the factors that contribute to a long and healthy life. Early experiments are already providing insights on brain ageing.",
            "Centenarians offer an opportunity to study longevity. People who\u2019ve lived to 100 have an amazing ability to bounce back from insult and injury, says George Murphy, a stem-cell biologist at the Boston University Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine. One centenarian he knows recovered from the 1912 Spanish flu and COVID-19, twice. One theory that explains centenarians\u2019 robust age is that they possess a genetic makeup that protects them from diseases. ",
            "But testing that idea is a challenge. People of that age are rare, which makes blood and skin samples from them a precious resource for research. That gave Murphy and his colleagues the idea to create a bank of centenarian cells that could be shared among scientists.",
            "\u201cThis bank is really exciting,\u201d says Chiara Herzog, who studies epigenetics and ageing at Kings College London.",
            "\u201cIt will be a very useful resource for the field,\u201d says Vadim Gladyshev, an ageing researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston.",
            "h2Finding centenarians",
            "Murphy collaborated with Tom Perls, a physician specializing in geriatrics, also at the Chobanian & Avedisian School of Medicine, who runs the largest study of people 100 years and older, the New England Centenarian Study. They searched for centenarians in US voter-registration lists, news articles and long-term-care facilities. Many were happy to participate \u201cbecause they know how special they are\u201d, says Perls.",
            "Participants were assessed for their cognitive and physical abilities, and had samples of their blood collected. Many were cognitively healthy and cared for themselves.",
            "For about 30 centenarians, the researchers isolated blood cells and reverted them to a pluripotent state, from which they could be turned into any cell type in the body. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells lose many aspects of their \u2018age\u2019 through the reversion process without altering their genetic code. This allows researchers to use the cells to study the genetic determinants of ageing, says Herzog.",
            "h2Emerging insights",
            "Experiments using the cells are already underway. For instance, Murphy\u2019s group has grown neurons from the centenarian iPS cells. One hallmark of ageing is that cells lose some of the quality-control mechanisms involved in protein production, which can contribute to disease. The as-yet unpublished results suggest that neurons derived from centenarians were quieter, not engaging this quality control under normal conditions compared with neurons derived from non-centenarians. But when a stressor was introduced, the centenarian-derived neurons efficiently and robustly switched those processes on, swiftly separating the bad proteins from the good ones at a more intense rate. ",
            "Another group has created 3D brain models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease using centenarian-derived brain cells and compared them with models made from cells derived from individuals in their 60s. In preliminary studies, the researchers found that centenarian-derived brain cells express high levels of genes associated with protection from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, says Doo Yeon Kim, a neurology researcher at Harvard Medical School.",
            "Eventually, researchers hope to use the cells to develop other cell types relevant to ageing, such as liver, muscle and gut cells, or even mini organs.",

The surface dates to 1.52 million years ago, and impressions of rippled sand, reed beds and fish nests suggest that the area was a lake shore with shallow water.",

The study, which was published in Nature on 27 November, analysed hundreds of pieces of fossilized digestive material, called bromalites, to reconstruct what dinosaurs ate and how this changed1. The fossils reveal that the rise of the dinosaurs, over millions of years during the Triassic period, was influenced by factors including climate change and other species\u2019 extinction.",
            "\u201cOur study shows that you can use pretty seemingly unremarkable fossils to get pretty remarkable results,\u201d says co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m, who studies early dinosaur evolution at Uppsala University in Sweden.",
            "Palaeontologists have come up with differing theories for how dinosaurs became the dominant species on Earth. Dinosaurs might have overtaken their rivals because they were particularly able to adapt to a changing ecosystem, for instance, or because random environmental changes favoured them over other species. But there isn\u2019t a single hypothesis that fully explains their rise to dominance.",

            "To better understand dinosaurs\u2019 early evolution, Qvarnstr\u00f6m and his colleagues cut open and examined more than 500 bromalites from the Polish Basin in Central Europe. The fossils are estimated to be around 200 million years old. ",
            "The team used several methods to analyse the bromalites and their contents, including different types of microscope and a technique known as synchrotron microtomography, which uses a particle accelerator to see inside the fossils in detail. The researchers also used chemical solutions to inspect the exact contents of the remains, which included fish, plants and insects.",
            "Despite the age and acidity of many of the fossils, the team found many of the insects the dinosaurs ate to be well preserved. \u201cSome of them were so beautifully preserved in three dimensions and with all the antennae and legs,\u201d says Qvarnstr\u00f6m.",
            "Analysis of the digestive materials allowed the researchers to \u201creconstruct these food webs, so who was eating whom in all these assemblages and see this trend over such a long period of time\u201d, Qvarnstr\u00f6m says.",
            "h2Adapt or die",
            "The team found that the number and variety of the contents of the fossils increased over time, suggesting that larger dinosaurs with more diverse feeding habits began to gain prominence in the late Triassic period (between 237 million and 201 million years ago). By comparing the fossils with plant data from the period, the researchers found that dinosaurs\u2019 rise was shaped by chance and by adaptations. For example, climate change led to increased humidity, which changed the vegetation available. Dinosaurs were able to better adapt to this shifting climate and change in diet than were other land animals.",

            "Singh says dinosaurs are an important source of data for understanding of how life responds to different pressures, for example climate change.",
            "He suggests that future research could use bromalites to understand how dinosaurs evolved in different parts of the world. \u201cCurrent studies suggest that dinosaurs evolved first in the Southern Hemisphere, and so maybe you have a different pattern happening down there,\u201d he says.",
