            "Clay cylinders unearthed from a tomb in Syria and dated to 4,400 years ago are inscribed with traces of the earliest known alphabetic writing system, an analysis suggests.",
            "The tomb was discovered in Umm el-Marra near Aleppo in 2004 and contained human remains and other objects from the Early Bronze Age (2600\u20132150 bc). The items included four clay cylinders, each about the size of a finger, engraved with eight distinct symbols.",

            "Archaeologist Glenn Schwartz at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who co-led the excavation and analysed the inscriptions, now suggests that the symbols represent sounds that correspond to a, i, k, l, n, s and y.",
            "The characters do not correspond to a known language, but Schwartz compared them with characters used in West Semitic languages \u2014 including ancient and modern forms of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic \u2014 to decode them. The inscriptions might record people\u2019s names or label objects in the tomb, said Schwartz, who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the American Society of Overseas Research in Boston, Massachusetts, on 21 November.",

The burial areas also contained gold jewellery, silver vessels, an ivory comb and pottery. \u201cJudging from their contents, these tombs belonged to people of the highest social rank,\u201d Schwartz said at the meeting.",
            "The cylinders are each one centimetre thick and 4.7 centimetres long, pierced with a small lengthwise hole. In 2021, using radiocarbon dating, Schwartz and his team determined1 that the tubes originate from around 2400 bc. \u201cIt\u2019s 500 years earlier than any other early alphabetic inscription we have. So that\u2019s surprising,\u201d says Dobbs-Allsopp.",

Bluesky has broad appeal in large part because it looks and feels a lot like X (formerly known as Twitter), which became hugely popular with scientists, who used it to share research findings, collaborate and network. One estimate suggests that at least half a million researchers had Twitter profiles in 2022.",
            "That was the year that billionaire Elon Musk bought the platform. He renamed it X and reduced content moderation, among other changes, prompting some researchers to leave. Since then, pornography, spam, bots and abusive content have increased on X, and community protections have decreased, say researchers.",

            "Since a schizophrenia drug, the first in decades with an innovative mechanism of action, gained US regulatory approval in September, some researchers have proclaimed a new era for psychiatric medicine. About half a dozen similar drugs \u2014 for schizophrenia, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other conditions involving the brain \u2014 are in various stages of development, most in early-stage clinical trials. But the success of these medicines is not a given. Last week, a trial of a highly anticipated schizophrenia drug reported disappointing results.",
            "For decades, schizophrenia drugs worked in essentially the same way. They blunted the activity of dopamine, a chemical involved in the disorder\u2019s hallmark symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. The new kid on the block is KarXT, sold as Cobenfy. It targets muscarinic receptors and leads to antipsychotic and cognitive benefits. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen this much buzz and excitement over a new approach in psychiatry in my career,\u201d says Jeffrey Conn, a pharmacologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.",
            "KarXT\u2019s success in winning US regulatory approval has revived interest in muscarinic drugs. \u201cDrug discovery is coming back to psychiatry,\u201d says Arthur Christopoulos, a molecular pharmacologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who was involved in the development of KarXT.",
            "But developing new medicines is a hard, long road. On 11 November, Abbvie, a pharmaceutical company in North Chicago, Illinois, announced that its muscarinic drug for schizophrenia, called emraclidine, had failed to outperform a placebo. What this means for other muscarinic drugs in development remains to be seen, Christopoulos says. \u201cIt is still early days.\u201d",
            "h2New psychiatric drugs",
            "KarXT\u2019s road to development wasn\u2019t smooth, either. Xanomeline, one of the active components of the drug, was developed in the 1990s and shown to reduce psychotic symptoms in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But, in a clinical trial1, many participants who received the drug stopped taking it owing to nausea, vomiting and other side effects. Muscarinic receptors are present throughout the brain and body so drugs that target them can have broad effects. The drug was shelved, along with others under development at the time. \u201cAlmost everyone decided that muscarinic agonists were probably an impossible feat to accomplish,\u201d says Conn, who was one of the scientific co-founders of the company behind KarXT.",
            "In 2009, Karuna Therapeutics, based in Boston, Massachusetts, combined xanomeline with another compound, trospium, which blocks muscarinic receptors but cannot cross into the brain, preventing unwanted side effects in the body. The combination became known as KarXT. In clinical trials, people with schizophrenia taking the combined drug experienced antipsychotic and cognitive benefits, with milder side effects than for xanomeline on its own.",
            "h2Mode of action",
            "Xanomeline acts mostly on two of the five muscarinic receptors: the M1 and M4 receptors. Animal studies suggest that the M4 receptor is most strongly associated with antipsychotic effects, whereas the M1 receptor is linked to cognition.",
            "Many of the schizophrenia drugs under investigation are aimed at just one of those receptors \u2014 a strategy that researchers hope will lead to bigger benefits with fewer side effects, says Andrew Tobin, a neuroscientist at the University of Glasgow, UK. (Tobin is the co-founder and chief executive of Keltic Pharma Therapeutics, a Dublin-based company that is working on developing muscarinic drugs.)",
            "Because of similarities in the binding sites of all five muscarinic receptors, selectively targeting one type is a challenge, Tobin says. To get around this, researchers are investigating \u2018allosteric modulators\u2019 of muscarinic receptors, which act on their targets through regions outside the binding site that are more distinct than the sites of the five muscarinic receptors.",
            "Emraclidine, an allosteric modulator targeting the M4 receptor, was one of the muscarinic drugs furthest along the development pipeline. But its failure in the Abbvie phase II trial raises questions, such as whether drugs need to target both the M1 and M4 receptors as KarXT does, says Brian Dean, a biochemist at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health in Parkville, Australia.",
            "h2Alzheimer\u2019s, addiction and beyond",
            "Pharmaceutical giant Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) in Princeton, New Jersey, which acquired Karuna in March, is running a trial in people to test whether KarXT can also help to treat psychosis associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as well as investigating whether the drug might benefit people with bipolar disorder.",
            "Given the role of M1 receptors in cognition, researchers are also designing drugs that target that receptor to reduce cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Tobin says researchers are hopeful that muscarinic drugs might also slow its progression. In 2016, he and his colleagues reported that an M1-specific drug slowed neurodegeneration in mice with a disease resembling Alzheimer\u2019s in humans2.",
            "Muscarinic receptors are found in the reward circuits in the brain, and studies have shown that blocking these pathways can protect animals from becoming addicted to opioids. The receptors are also involved in movement, leading some scientists to examine whether blocking them might help people with Parkinson\u2019s disease3.",
            "h2Real-world test",
            "Although excitement swirls around KarXT, how it fares in the real world remains to be seen. During the clinical trials, participants remained in hospital, where there were few opportunities for environmental influences to affect treatment, says Carol Tamminga, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. (Tamminga is a scientific adviser for Karuna and was involved in the clinical trials of KarXT.)",
            "Last month, BMS released data from two, year-long follow-up studies on KarXT treatment in people with schizophrenia who were treated as outpatients. Although they continued to improve over that time, 11\u201318% of the participants stopped taking the drug because of side effects. Ceasing to take a drug is a problem with other available schizophrenia therapeutics. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot to learn about these drugs,\u201d Tamminga says. ",

            "In a children\u2019s hospital in Vancouver, Canada, a teenager is in critical condition after being infected with an avian influenza virus that has researchers on high alert.",
            "Viral genome sequences released last week suggest that the teenager is infected with an H5N1 avian influenza virus bearing mutations that might improve its ability to infect the human airway. If true, it could mean that the virus can rapidly evolve to make the jump from birds to humans.",
            "It\u2019s a worrying development but it doesn\u2019t mean that a new pandemic is imminent, says immunologist Scott Hensley at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. At present, there is no sign that the virus \u2014 which is related but not identical to the H5N1 virus infecting US dairy cattle \u2014 has been transmitted from the sick adolescent to other people.",
            "\u201cThere is reason to be concerned,\u201d he says. \u201cBut not reason to totally freak out.\u201d",
            "h2How did the teenager get infected?",
            "That is unclear. The adolescent did not work or live on a poultry farm, and researchers have found no signs of H5N1 infection in household pets, said Bonnie Henry, a public health officer for the province of British Columbia in Victoria, Canada, during a press conference. \u201cThere is a very real possibility that we may not ever determine the source,\u201d Henry said.",
            "h2Why is this virus so concerning?",
            "The sequencing data suggest that the teenager is infected with a mixture of viruses, all of which are similar to a lineage of H5N1 viruses that is currently infecting poultry and waterfowl in the region. But researchers have homed in on three key differences between those viruses and the teenager\u2019s: two possible mutations that could enhance the virus\u2019s ability to infect human cells, and another that could allow it to replicate more easily in human cells, not just in the cells of its usual avian host.",
            "Could bird flu in cows lead to a human outbreak? Slow response worries scientists",
            "One interpretation of the sequencing data is that some of the viruses infecting the teenager contain the new mutations, and some do not. Such a result could also indicate an error in the sequencing process, but the rest of the sequences look clean and this particular constellation of mutations is unlikely to occur by chance, says Jesse Bloom, who studies viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. \u201cIt pops out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt suggests that there is some evolution going on in this virus right at these important positions.\u201d",
            "Furthermore, the teenager initially had an eye infection, which later developed into a severe lung infection. This could suggest that the virus became better able to enter airway cells after it had infected the adolescent. \u201cIt\u2019s consistent with the idea that the virus might have evolved within that individual,\u201d says Hensley.",
            "That could be good news of a sort: it implies that the mutated form of the virus was not the form that originally infected the teenager, and therefore that it might not be circulating widely.",
            "h2Are we on the cusp of another pandemic?",
            "Public-health authorities in Canada have tested about three-dozen close contacts of the infected teenager, none of whom seem to have had H5N1 infections. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear that there is any indication that this individual transmitted this virus on to others,\u201d says Bloom.",
            "And just because a virus has evolved to better infect and replicate in human cells, that does not mean that it has also gained the ability to spread to other people, says Hensley. \u201cBeing able to bind to human cell is a prerequisite to cause a pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s often not sufficient.\u201d",
            "Even so, governments and researchers have been preparing in case H5N1 does become transmissible between people. Scientists are developing and testing vaccines against the currently circulating H5N1 viruses, and research1 has shown that stockpiles of H5N1 vaccines designed in the mid-2000s might still be effective against more recent H5N1 viruses. Hensley says that these vaccines are also likely to be effective against viruses such as those found in the teenager.",

He went outside and saw a live duck mounting the dead one that had just hit the window. It was the first documented case of homosexual necrophilia in ducks, says Moeliker, who reported his findings six years later2. He expected that only a handful of people would read the paper, but then he received a phone call in 2003 offering him an Ig Nobel Prize.",

He shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for the discovery of graphene, but the Ig Nobel came a decade earlier for a very different kind of work: using a magnet to levitate a frog. One Friday night at Radboud University in the Netherlands, Geim poured water into a powerful 16-tesla magnet and found that it levitated. The floating drop shocked his colleagues because it seemed to violate ideas about magnetism.",
            "Success with water led to a series of other experiments with levitating objects \u2014 and eventually with a small frog that survived its wild ride unharmed.",
            "You must be joking: funny paper titles might lead to more citations",

So he reached out to Michael Berry, a theoretical physicist at the University of Bristol, UK, and Geim\u2019s co-author on a paper describing the levitating frog3. As a tenured academic, Berry provided the cover of being associated with a highly respected scientist.",
            "Geim talks often about his frog experiment and the value of the curiosity-led science that led to his Ig Nobel Prize. It was on another Friday night, several years after the levitation experiments, that Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who is now at the National University of Singapore, stuck a piece of tape to graphite, leading to their discovery of graphene4 \u2014 and their shared Nobel prize.",

Abrahams also arranges for them to be handed out by Nobel prize-winners at the annual ceremony. \u201cTo have these credible people be a part of it makes it much harder for anyone to jump to the conclusion that we are out to do damage,\u201d he says.",

Eric Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California, was part of a group of nearly 1,000 people who won the 1993 Ig Nobel Literature prize for \u201cpublishing a medical research paper which has one hundred times as many authors as pages\u201d. He says that the study should not have been made light of; at the time, it was the largest heart-attack study in history, with more than 40,000 participants5, he adds.",
            "Topol says that he thinks the name Ig Nobel \u201cis out of alignment with the more recent ones. They\u2019re more for humour\u2019s sake.\u201d",
            "Abrahams agrees, saying, \u201cIn retrospect, I kind of wish we\u2019d chosen a different name.\u201d",
            "h2Running on water",
            "In the past two decades, most of the awards have gone to lighter research \u2014 sometimes quite literally. So it was for a 2013 prize for Alberto Minetti at the University of Milan in Italy.",
            "Minetti studies the biomechanics of locomotion and has long had an interest in the forces involved in running. When he learnt that spacecraft orbiting the Moon had detected evidence of water in 2008, he wondered whether a person could run on water on the Moon, which has a gravitational force only about 16% as strong as that of Earth.",
            "Using mathematical models from the basilisk lizard (Basiliscus basiliscus) and the western grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), two vertebrates that can run on the surface of water, Minetti calculated that it was theoretically possible. Then, he and his colleagues tested their calculations by attaching a person to a harness to simulate weaker gravity. With the aid of small fins on his feet, a participant was able to stay afloat while running in place in a wading pool, the researchers reported6 in 2012.",
            "The following year, Minetti received a phone call from Abrahams, who offered him an Ig Nobel. At the time, he wasn\u2019t sure of the prize\u2019s standing or what it would do to his reputation, so he conducted a survey among his colleagues. \u201cMost of the people I spoke to were very positive about it,\u201d says Minetti.",

The lead author of the study7, Ryo Okabe at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, has been treating patients as a clinician for more than 15 years, while also carrying out research projects. The research behind the Ig Nobel was a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers wanted to see whether they could develop an alternative breathing method in the event of respiratory failure.",
            "He was honoured to win the prize and thinks that the award will be a driving force to conduct future research. \u201cI learnt that [the other laureates] are all engaged in their respective research with humour and passion.\u201d",

            "The Ig Nobel has come a long way since it was launched more than three decades ago. What started as a prize that scientists were wary of has been embraced by many.",
            "Minna Lyons, who won the prize in 2014 along with her colleagues, still cherishes her Ig Nobel. \u201cIt has been one of the best surprises in my academic career, by far.\u201d She won for \u201camassing evidence that people who habitually stay up late are, on average, more self-admiring, more manipulative, and more psychopathic than people who wake up early in the morning\u201d.",
            "Lyons, who is a psychologist at Liverpool John Moores University, UK, says that the prize is excellent for public engagement because it makes science popular, and for this reason, the Ig Nobel is one of the most respected academic awards in her field, she says.",

In a trial, the approach reduced participants\u2019 susceptibility to malaria, potentially paving the way for more effective ways to stop the disease, which infects some 250 million people a year.",
            "\u201cThese findings represent a significant step forward in malaria vaccine development,\u201d says Julius Hafalla, an immunologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \u201cThe ongoing global malaria burden makes the development of more effective vaccines a critical priority.\u201d",
            "The study, which was published1 in The New England Journal of Medicine on 20 November, exposed participants to bites from mosquitoes that had a modified version of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite, which causes malaria. In humans, the parasites travel to the liver and then infect red blood cells. The parasites were engineered to stop developing shortly after delivery into a human. Nearly 90% of participants exposed to the modified parasites avoided contracting the disease after being bitten by malaria mosquitoes.",
            "There are two approved malaria vaccines. Both aim to provide long-term immunity by producing antibodies that block malaria parasites from infecting liver cells, as well as targeting breakthrough infections.",

            "Gabryele Moreira first became interested in physics during a pre-university course she took in the outskirts of Salvador in northeastern Brazil in 2011. Two years later, she was admitted to the Federal University of Sergipe in S\u00e3o Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o through an ethnic\u2013racial minority quota system and began her undergraduate studies in medical physics. She was supported by housing and meal scholarships, which were \u201cboth essential for me to stay in university and keep up with my studies\u201d, she says.",
            "But her path to graduate education was more challenging, because there was no similar affirmative-action policy when she was applying for a master\u2019s degree in nuclear technology at the Institute for Energy and Nuclear Research in S\u00e3o Paulo, in 2018. \u201cI remember turning to YouTube videos to try to learn English in order to prepare for the foreign language-proficiency test in the master\u2019s selection process,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the opportunity to take courses during my undergraduate studies.\u201d",
            "She was accepted, becoming at that time the only Black person in the programme. \u201cI could see myself in others when I was in Sergipe, but in S\u00e3o Paulo, I realized that people like me were a minority in graduate programmes, especially in areas such as nuclear energy,\u201d Moreira says.",
            "h2Slow to adapt",
            "Stories such as Moreira\u2019s \u2014 and studies released in the past several years \u2014 indicate that affirmative-action policies have not yet become mainstream in graduate science education in Brazil. \u201cThere\u2019s still much ground to be gained,\u201d says Anna Venturini, a political-science researcher at the Brazilian Center of Analysis and Planning in S\u00e3o Paulo who has been studying affirmative-action policies in graduate programmes since 2014.",

            "More than half of Brazil\u2019s 203 million inhabitants identify as Black, mixed-race or Indigenous. Still, white individuals currently represent 90% of Brazilian scientists \u2014 a proportion 12 times higher than that of Black, mixed-heritage and Indigenous individuals combined, according to a study by researchers at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cThese groups are minorities in almost all fields of the hard sciences,\u201d says co-author Marcia Rangel Candido.",
            "To try to correct these inequalities and promote equity in historically marginalized minority groups, graduate programmes first began to implement affirmative-action policies in the 2000s, some on their own initiative and others as a requirement under state laws and university resolutions. The movement gained traction in 2016, when the government started to require federal higher-education institutions to submit proposed measures for including Black, mixed-race, Indigenous and disabled people in their graduate programmes.",
            "As a result, the percentage of graduate programmes in Brazil with affirmative action rose from 26% in 2018 to 54% in 2021, according to a 2022 analysis by Venturini and her colleague. Yet such initiatives have been unevenly distributed across academic fields.",
            "h2Field-specific",
            "The voluntary expansion of affirmative action in recent years has been driven mostly by the humanities and social sciences, in which 36\u201344% of graduate programmes have adopted these policies on their own initiative. \u201cResearchers in the humanities historically tend to be more likely to think of strategies to mitigate inequalities in access to higher education, because they have a long tradition of research on this issue,\u201d says Jaqueline Gomes de Jesus, a Black transgender psychologist at the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro, and the first manager of the affirmative-action system for Black undergraduate students at the University of Bras\u00edlia.",
            "Universities axe diversity statements in wake of US Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action",
            "Conversely, graduate programmes in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) are the least likely to create affirmative-action initiatives, according to the survey by Venturini and her colleague. Only 9.5% of Brazil\u2019s engineering graduate programmes and 5.6% of its agricultural-sciences graduate programmes have voluntarily adopted affirmative action over the past few decades.",
            "Venturini says that \u201ca culture of conservative meritocracy\u201d could be contributing to the resistance to implementing affirmative action in STEM programmes. \u201cThe admissions processes for these programmes attach less value to candidates\u2019 backgrounds and assume that the best-qualified are simply those with the highest test scores,\u201d she says. \u201cThe belief that affirmative-action policies are harmful to \u2018the more capable candidates\u2019 is highly prevalent in hard-science programmes.\u201d",
