            "A fruit fly might not be the smartest organism, but scientists can still learn a lot from its brain. Researchers are hoping to do that now that they have a new map \u2014 the most complete for any organism so far \u2014 of the brain of a single fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). The wiring diagram, or \u2018connectome\u2019, includes nearly 140,000 neurons and captures more than 54.5 million synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells.",
            "\u201cThis is a huge deal,\u201d says Clay Reid, a neurobiologist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington, who was not involved in the project but has worked with one of the team members who was. \u201cIt\u2019s something that the world has been anxiously waiting for, for a long time.\u201d",
            "The map1 is described in a package of nine papers about the data published in Nature today. Its creators are part of a consortium known as FlyWire, co-led by neuroscientists Mala Murthy and Sebastian Seung at Princeton University in New Jersey.",
            "h2A long road",
            "Seung and Murthy say that they\u2019ve been developing the FlyWire map for more than four years, using electron microscopy images of slices of the fly\u2019s brain. The researchers and their colleagues stitched the data together to form a full map of the brain with the help of artificial-intelligence (AI) tools.",
            "But these tools aren\u2019t perfect, and the wiring diagram needed to be checked for errors. The scientists spent a great deal of time manually proofreading the data \u2014 so much time that they invited volunteers to help. In all, the consortium members and the volunteers made more than three million manual edits, according to co-author Gregory Jefferis, a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. (He notes that much of this work took place in 2020, when fly researchers were at loose ends and working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.)",
            "\n",
            "But the work wasn\u2019t finished: the map still had to be annotated, a process in which the researchers and volunteers labelled each neuron as a particular cell type. Jefferis compares the task to assessing satellite images: AI software might be trained to recognize lakes or roads in such images, but humans would have to check the results and name the specific lakes or roads themselves. All told, the researchers identified 8,453 types of neuron \u2014 much more than anyone had expected. Of these, 4,581 were newly discovered, which will create new research directions, Seung says. \u201cEvery one of those cell types is a question,\u201d he adds.",
            "The team was surprised by some of the ways in which the various cells connect to one another, too. For instance, neurons that were thought to be involved in just one sensory wiring circuit, such as a visual pathway, tended to receive cues from multiple senses, including hearing and touch1. \u201cIt\u2019s astounding how interconnected the brain is,\u201d Murthy says.",
            "h2Exploring the map",
            "The FlyWire map data have been available for the past few years for researchers to explore. This has enabled scientists to learn more about the brain and about fruit flies \u2014 findings that are captured in some of the papers published in Nature today.",
            "\n\nCubic millimetre of brain mapped in spectacular detail\n",
            "In one paper2, for example, researchers used the connectome to create a computer model of the entire fruit-fly brain, including all the connections between neurons. They tested it by activating neurons that they knew either sense sweet or bitter tastes. These neurons then launched a cascade of signals through the virtual fly\u2019s brain, ultimately triggering motor neurons tied to the fly\u2019s proboscis \u2014 the equivalent of the mammalian tongue. When the sweet circuit was activated, a signal for extending the proboscis was transmitted, as if the insect was preparing to feed; when the bitter circuit was activated, this signal was inhibited. To validate these findings, the team activated the same neurons in a real fruit fly. The researchers learnt that the simulation was more than 90% accurate at predicting which neurons would respond and therefore how the fly would behave.",
            "In another study3, researchers describe two wiring circuits that signal a fly to stop walking. One of these contains two neurons that are responsible for halting \u2018walk\u2019 signals sent from the brain when the fly wants to stop and feed. The other circuit includes neurons in the nerve cord, which receives and processes signals from the brain. These cells create resistance in the fly\u2019s leg joints, allowing the insect to stop while it grooms itself.",
            "One limitation of the new connectome is that it was created from a single female fruit fly. Although fruit-fly brains are similar to each other, they are not identical. Until now, the most complete connectome for a fruit-fly brain was a map of a \u2018hemibrain\u2019 \u2014 a portion of a fly\u2019s brain containing around 25,000 neurons. In one of the Nature papers out today4, Jefferis, Davi Bock, a neurobiologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington, and their colleagues compared the FlyWire brain with the hemibrain.",
            "Some of the differences were striking. The FlyWire fly had almost twice as many neurons in a brain structure called the mushroom body, which is involved in smell, compared with the fly used in the hemibrain-mapping project. Bock thinks the discrepancy could be because the hemibrain fly might have starved while it was still growing, which harmed its brain development.",
            "The FlyWire researchers say that much work remains to be done to fully understand the fruit-fly brain. For instance, the latest connectome shows only how neurons connect through chemical synapses, across which molecules called neurotransmitters send information. It doesn\u2019t offer any information about electrical connectivity between neurons or about how neurons chemically communicate outside synapses. And Murthy hopes to eventually have a male fly connectome, too, which would allow researchers to study male-specific behaviours such as singing. \u201cWe\u2019re not done, but it\u2019s a big step,\u201d Bock says.",

            "Age impedes the ability of the brain\u2019s stem cells to churn out new cells, but the study\u2019s authors found that reducing the activity of a particular gene rejuvenated these stem cells, allowing them to proliferate and provide the brain with a supply of fresh neurons.",
            "That gene regulates stem cells\u2019 consumption of glucose, a sugar that is key to cellular metabolism. The results in mice fit well with an emerging picture from studies of postmortem human brains. These efforts, too, have found that age affects metabolism in the brain, says Maura Boldrini, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City who was not involved in the latest research. \u201cProbably their metabolism is less efficient than it used to be,\u201d she says, adding that both the human results and the mouse study, published today in Nature, \u201copen new avenues for potential therapeutics.\u201d",
            "h2A youthful brain",
            "The role of neural stem cells in the adult human brain has been controversial. Boldrini and others have published evidence that new neurons are made in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is important for learning and memory, at least until the age of 792. Her team is now looking to see whether production of new neurons is altered in people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease or psychiatric illnesses. But some researchers have reported that they could not find evidence that adults make new neurons in the hippocampus. \u201cThis controversy is still continuing,\u201d Boldrini says.",
            "\n\nHuman brain cells implanted in rats prompt excitement \u2014 and concern\n",
            "In mice, the picture is clearer. Neural stem cells in a region of the brain called the subventricular zone can give rise to neurons and other types of cells. These young cells then migrate to the olfactory bulb, which controls the sense of smell. A steady supply of fresh neurons to the olfactory bulb makes sense in mice, because they rely heavily on smell to perceive changes in their environment, says Anne Brunet, a geneticist who studies ageing at Stanford University in California and who is an author of the new study.",
            "As mice age, however, those stem cells become less active. Brunet and her colleagues decided to find out why. The team used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to systematically disrupt 23,000 genes, and then tested the effect of each disrupted gene on neural stem cells that had been taken from young and old mice and grown in the laboratory.",
            "h2Neuronal boost",
            "The screen yielded 300 genes that might play a part in neural stem-cell ageing. The researchers further narrowed the pool by using CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt some of these genes in cells in the subventricular zone of living young and old mice. The authors then checked the animals\u2019 olfactory bulbs and identified a select group of key genes. Disruption of these genes boosted stem cells\u2019 production of neurons in the old animals \u2014 but did not affect stem cells in young animals.",
            "\n\nFive ways the brain can age: 50,000 scans reveal possible patterns of damage\n",
            "One such gene, called Slc2a4, codes for a protein that imports glucose into cells. Disrupting it reduced cells\u2019 glucose intake and increased their power to proliferate.",
            "That result meshes with previous studies that have found a link between sugar metabolism and ageing, says Saul Villeda, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. For example, researchers recently reported that a diabetes drug can stave off age-related cognitive decline in monkeys. But the latest finding is particularly important, he says, because it points to a specific protein that has a key role and could be targeted in future studies.",
            "Even if the role of neural stem cells in adult humans is in question, the results provide crucial information for the design of cell therapies that might one day treat neurodegenerative conditions, Villeda says.",

Instead, o1 provides a reconstructed summary of its logic for the user, alongside its answers. It\u2019s unclear, White says, whether the full chain of thought, if revealed, would look similar to human reasoning.",

It happens when electric fields of around 100 million volts develop inside churning clouds, creating a natural particle accelerator. When cascades of electrons, zooming at close to light speed, collide with air molecules, they release \u03b3-ray radiation. But where so many of these electrons come from remains uncertain.",

These would zoom in the opposite direction to electrons, in a cycle that creates fresh particle avalanches, which might explain the quantity of \u03b3-rays and the flicker, says Dwyer.",

Why animals in the southern region have so far escaped infection is a mystery, but scientists have several theories.",
            "For one, Australia is geographically isolated and doesn\u2019t import live poultry, says Frank Wong, a virologist at the CSIRO Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong. Many of the countries\u2019 birds are endemic and do not migrate to regions where the virus is spreading.",
            "But the virus\u2019s arrival in Australia is \u201ca matter of when, not if\u201d, says Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne, Australia.",
            "h2Bird survey",
            "Wille thinks that long-distance migratory shorebirds and seabirds that come from Siberia and Alaska through southeast Asia to Australia are most likely to carry the virus into the country.",
            "This week, Australian scientists, including Wille, started swabbing the first of nearly 1,000 migratory birds for the virus. Over the coming weeks, the team will capture wedge-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica) and short-tailed shearwaters (Ardenna tenuirostris) as they migrate from the northern autumn to the southern spring. At night, shearwaters sleep in burrows and are relatively easy to grab. The researchers will swab the birds for the virus, and take blood to test for antibodies that will reveal previous exposure. They will be testing for the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in particular, which has caused mass mortality in birds and some mammals.",
            "To swab the birds, the researchers will travel to seven locations across Australia, as far apart as Broome in the northwest, Lord Howe Island in the east and Phillip Island in the south.",
            "h2Deadly ducks?",
            "Wille says another possible route for the virus is through ducks. Scientists think migrating ducks and geese in other parts of the world can spread the disease without succumbing to it.",
            "That\u2019s because ducks\u2019 epithelial cells have a sensor, known as RIG-I, that detects an invading influenza virus and triggers an immune response that usually fends it off. Kirsty Short, a virologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, says ducks might have evolved such defences in Asia from repeated infections with many less-pathogenic forms of the virus, giving them pre-existing immunity. Although they don\u2019t get sick from H5N1, they can still pass it on, and ducks congregate in lakes and ponds with other birds, increasing the chances of disease spread.",
            "h2Isolated ecosystems",
            "Another reason that Oceania is currently free of the virus is that the region\u2019s ducks are endemic and they don\u2019t tend to migrate overseas.",
            "This isolation is partly explained by a biogeographical division called the Wallace Line, first described by naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1859, which runs through Indonesia. Many animal species tend to stay on one side of the line or the other, and because of this isolation, the fauna on each side are distinct. Michael Andersen, an evolutionary biologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, describes this phenomenon as \u201cone of the great mysteries\u201d of the world.",
            "The sharp division might also mean that the virus is not adapted to animals east of the Wallace Line, says Wong. \u201cAvian influenza viruses, including this high-pathogenicity avian influenza virus, are particularly well-adapted to certain species,\u201d he says. Birds in Australia could have a genetic make-up that circumvents the usual infection route for the virus, but no one has yet tested this hypothesis.",
            "Although many duck species are short-distance migratory birds and tend not to cross the Wallace Line, some species \u2014 including Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa) and spotted whistling duck (Dendrocygna guttata) \u2014 do, and Wille thinks they could introduce H5N1 to the region.",
            "If the virus is detected, government veterinarians will immediately move in to cull the affected population, which happened when H7N3 and H7N9 strains of the flu were detected in Victoria in May.",
            "Short says that, when it happens, the effect on Australia\u2019s birds, mammals and ecosystems is unknown, but many species are probably susceptible. \u201cIt\u2019s a big research gap,\u201d she says.",

This advance is the first step towards mass production of such therapies.",

He says that three days after receiving the therapy, he felt his skin loosen and he could start moving his fingers and opening his mouth again. Two weeks later, he returned to his office job. \u201cI feel very good,\u201d he says, more than a year after receiving the treatment.",

But the therapy typically relies on a person\u2019s own immune cells, and this personalization makes it expensive and time consuming.",

If successful, they would allow pharmaceutical companies to scale up manufacturing, potentially slashing costs and production times. Instead of making one treatment for one person, therapies for more than a hundred people could be made from one donor\u2019s cells, says Lin Xin, an immunologist at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Xu and his colleagues extracted T cells from a 21-year-old woman and studded them with CARs that recognize CD19, a receptor found on the surface of B cells. They used the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene-editing tool to knock out five genes in the T cells, to prevent both the grafted cells from attacking the host\u2019s body and the host\u2019s immune system from attacking the donor cells.",

They multiplied and targeted and destroyed all the B cells \u2014 including pathogenic cells linked to the autoimmune conditions. The bioengineered T cells survived for weeks in the recipients before largely vanishing. Eventually, new healthy B cells returned, but no pathogenic ones did. A similar response has been observed in people with autoimmune conditions who received CAR T cells derived from their own cells3.",

The woman\u2019s autoantibodies had dropped to undetectable levels, and her muscle strength and mobility had improved dramatically.",

            "Narrative CVs can help funders to see the human being behind a funding application. They can capture periods of parental leave, for example, which are harder to account for in conventional CV formats, she adds.",
            "\u201cBut many researchers have no experience with how to write narrative CVs, what to include, and how to avoid it becoming a very lengthy text that nobody will really read,\u201d Solymosi concludes. This is why mentoring support is needed, she says.",
            "h2A sea change for CVs",
            "Individual researchers can register on PEP-CV as mentors or people seeking advice. Those seeking a mentor can then search for one who best fits their needs. If that person accepts the request, the two are connected through e-mail. Since its launch in March, the platform has garnered around 500 users, 153 mentors and 348 seeking guidance.",
            "Tanita Casci, who directs the research strategy and policy unit at the University of Oxford, UK, says that a mentoring platform such as PEP-CV can help researchers who do not have much local support to find guidance on how to craft their CV.",
            "Because knowledge of this CV format is not yet widespread, she adds, it means that \u201crather than the narrative CV achieving its intended aims of allowing for greater diversity in applicant pools and awardee pools, it\u2019s actually favouring those who are in institutions that have the appropriate support\u201d.",
            "Future plans include incentivizing mentors to offer their time for free by allowing them to claim recognition using ORCID, a tool that assigns unique identifiers to authors to capture bibliometric outputs. This will enable them to earn credit for their work.",
            "Kelly Cobey, who leads the metascience and open-science programme at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, says a change in behaviour is needed to shift in how research is assessed, and narrative CVs are part of that process.",
            "Currently, grant applicants don\u2019t always know what funders are looking for in narrative CVs, which is why more mentoring support is a positive step, Cobey adds.",
            "In addition to guidance on crafting CVs, Casci thinks institutions should support researchers by making sure they are participating in relevant activities to gain knowledge and experiences that they can eventually write about.",
