            "Physicists in Italy and China have for the first time observed glimmers of the \u2018neutrino fog\u2019, signals from neutrinos that mimic those expected to be produced by dark matter.",
            "The observations are a double-edged sword, says Nicole Bell, a theoretical physicist at the University of Melbourne, Australia. On the one hand, it means that detectors have become sensitive enough to pick up signals of dark matter \u2014 the mysterious substance thought to make up the bulk of matter in the Universe. On the other, it means that the neutrino signals could obscure the dark-matter signals that scientists are so eager to observe. The findings were published in two papers in Physical Review Letters last month1,2.",
            "Every second, trillions of neutrinos stream through Earth \u2014 unnoticed, because they barely interact with ordinary matter. Most of these almost massless particles are produced by fusion reactions in the Sun, such as those that trigger the radioactive \u03b2-decay of the isotope boron-8.",

            "A popular weight-loss regimen stunts hair growth, data collected from mice and humans suggest1. The study\u2019s findings show that intermittent fasting, which involves short bouts of food deprivation, triggers a stress response that can inhibit or even kill hair-follicle stem cells, which give rise to hair.",
            "The results, published in today in Cell, suggest that although short-term fasting can provide health benefits, such as increased lifespan in mice, not all tissue and cell types benefit.",
            "\u201cI was shocked to hear these results,\u201d says \u00d6mer Yilmaz, a stem-cell biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge who was not involved in the study. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to expect that fasting is going to be beneficial for most, if not all cell types and good for stem cells. This is the inverse of what we expected, and the finding seems to hold true in humans.\u201d",
            "h2Deliberate deprivation",
            "During the past decade, intermittent fasting has become one of the most popular dieting regimens; by one count, about 12% of adults in the United States practised it in 2023. One of the most common forms is time-restricted eating, which involves eating only within a limited time frame each day.",
            "Stem cells seem to be particularly vulnerable to changes in diet. For example, Yilmaz and his colleagues reported2 in August that stem cells in the guts of mice showed a burst of activity during post-fast feasting. This activity helped to repair damage in the animals\u2019 intestines.",
            "To learn whether dieting affects hair regrowth, which can be affected by stress, Bing Zhang, a regenerative biologist at Westlake University in Zhejiang, China, and his colleagues shaved mice and subjected them to one of two intermittent-fasting regimens: time-restricted eating and alternate-day fasting, in which animals fasted for 24 hours and then ate their normal diet for the following 24 hours. By the end of the three-month study, the dieting mice had not regrown as much hair as control animals that ate a similar number of calories, the authors found.",

            "The researchers traced this effect to the death of hair-follicle stem cells. Further experiments showed that intermittent fasting kick-started communication between the adrenal glands, organs that produce stress hormones, and fat cells in the skin. This crosstalk caused skin fat cells to release molecules called fatty acids. The fatty acids disrupted the stem cells\u2019 metabolism and caused damage that, in some cases, led to the stem cells\u2019 death. Application of an antioxidant cream before and during the diet prevented stunting of hair growth, suggesting that this effect is not inevitable.",
            "To learn whether this effect extends to humans, the researchers randomly assigned 49 people to either an intermittent-fasting regimen or a control group, whose members ate without time restrictions. Hair growth in the fasting group was 18% slower than in the control group. Molecular tests found evidence that a mechanism similar to that observed in the mice could be responsible for this effect.",
            "Reduced-\ufeffcalorie diet shows signs of slowing ageing in people",
            "It is \u201cintriguing\u201d that these effects did not extend to the related stem cells that make and repair the outer layer of the skin, but those cells form an essential immune barrier, says Elaine Fuchs, a stem-cell researcher at the Rockefeller University in New York City who was not involved in the study. \u201cAt least some of us would agree that unless you are a musk ox on an Alaskan tundra, hair is dispensable,\u201d Fuchs says. \u201cIn intermittent fasting, the body doesn\u2019t know when it will next receive a meal, and the need becomes protecting the main core organs while dispensing with those that aren\u2019t essential.\u201d",
            "Yilmaz and his colleagues also found a downside to intermittent fasting: the diet could prompt the development of precancerous intestinal growths if mice incurred a cancer-causing genetic change during the post-fasting period2. These findings should prompt further investigations of fasting\u2019s effects on cells in the brain and the liver, Yilmaz says.",

            "The original pact was forged in 1979 to thaw diplomatic relations between China and the United States. It is normally renewed every five years, but it expired on 27 August last year amid rising tensions. Although the two nations recognized that new terms were needed in the agreement, they were unable to finalize the details before the deadline. Instead, they extended the old pact and kept negotiating.",
            "US and China inch towards renewing science-cooperation pact \u2014 despite tensions",
            "Researchers and other specialists warned that without the agreement, which is symbolic and doesn\u2019t provide any funding, research cooperation and programmes between the two governments could flounder.",
            "A US Department of State official said at a briefing on 12 December that the government recognized that failure to have an agreement would have a chilling effect on areas of science and technology that are important to the United States. The new agreement is \u201cmodernized, with built-in protections\u201d, the official said.",
            "The state department will now vet all research projects to ensure that they don\u2019t pose national security concerns before they are approved. Proposals will also be reviewed by other US agencies led by the White House.",
            "Aside from specifying that critical and emerging technologies are off the table for collaboration, the pact does not further limit which scientific areas are fair game. But a US state department official suggested permissible projects might include research on the weather, oceanography and geology, as well as collecting influenza and air-quality data.",
            "China Initiative\u2019s shadow looms large for US scientists",
            "The revamped pact addresses concerns from the United States that China did not always meet its obligation to share data under the previous agreement. The United States has been frustrated, for instance, that China has not been more transparent about data collected by a virology laboratory in Wuhan, where the first COVID-19 cases were detected. Some think that a virus could have leaked from that lab to trigger the pandemic.",
            "The agreement now includes wording that commits both the United States and China to sharing data, and being open and transparent. It also lays out a dispute-resolution mechanism by which both nations can iron out difficulties encountered in projects. If either side does not uphold its commitments, a termination clause allows the nations to end the agreement.",
            "Many of the concerns about the old pact came from the United States, given China\u2019s rise in power. So in these negotiations, China has been \u201cthe passive side\u201d, Duan says.",

            "Because of the timing of the new pact\u2019s signing, one uncertainty hanging over it is whether the incoming administration of president-elect Donald Trump, who will take office in about a month, will uphold it. Researchers who spoke to Nature say they don\u2019t expect the Trump administration to declare the agreement weak and reverse it, given that it already represents a compromise. Also, the agreement was last renewed in 2018 during Trump\u2019s first presidency, Duan points out. Still, he adds, \u201cwe have to see what he will do\u201d.",

            "Although scientists have previously seen immune responses in the skin during infections, finding similar reactions in healthy skin is \u201ca surprise\u201d, says Daniel Kaplan, a dermatologist and immunologist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. \u201cThe idea of a semi-autonomous immune system in a peripheral tissue is very exciting,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Dual role",
            "The immune system has to fight off harmful pathogens without attacking the helpful microorganisms that inhabit the body. Previous research showed3 that the skin of adult mice that had been raised without microbes could be colonized by Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common and harmless bacterium found on human skin. This long-term colonization triggered the production of specific immune cells, called T cells, which helped to strengthen local immunity.",
            "\u201cThe next and maybe main chapter in this saga is that the response to this ubiquitous skin colonist is much more potent than we had realized,\u201d says Michael Fischbach, a microbiologist at Stanford University in California, who co-authored both of the latest studies. ",
            "\u201cWhen the immune system sees a friendly bacterium, you would think that it would just give a friendly wave and walk in the other direction, but that\u2019s not at all what happens,\u201d he says.",
            "In experiments with mice, Fischbach and his colleagues discovered that S. epidermidis triggers the activation of B cells, the immune cells necessary to produce antibodies1. The skin then made antibodies against S. epidermidis; these persisted for at least 200 days and could form without previous exposure to other microbes.",
            "The skin was able to generate this immune response even when lymph nodes \u2014 the immune hubs that help to activate immune cells \u2014 were disabled. The presence of S. epidermidis also induced the formation of specialized immune structures in the skin that attract T and B cells, boosting the production of antibodies.",
            "h2Immune memory",
            "Vaccines work by teaching the immune system \u2014 which includes T and B cells, along with antibodies \u2014 to recognize and remember a pathogen, so the body can respond quickly if exposed again.",
            "Building on this idea, Fischbach and his team explored whether they could redirect the immune response triggered by the harmless S. epidermidis to target pathogens, to develop a new type of vaccine.",
            "In a second study2, the researchers showed that S. epidermidis triggers an antibody response resembling that seen in conventional vaccines.",
            "By modifying S. epidermidis to display foreign proteins \u2014 such as part of the tetanus toxin \u2014 on its surface, the researchers were able to induce immune responses in the mice\u2019s bloodstream and in mucous membranes such as the lining of the nose. These responses protected the animals when they were given a lethal dose of the toxin.",
            "h2Mucosal vaccines",
            "Fischbach\u2019s work is part of a growing interest in developing vaccines that induce antibodies in mucosal areas. This type of protection could help to stop respiratory or other infections before they start and reduce the spread of disease.",
            "Another advantage over conventional vaccines is that engineered S. epidermidis could be added to a cream and simply applied to the skin. Such a vaccine, Fischbach says, would be cheap to produce and easy to distribute. Furthermore, it would not have to be administered by health-care worker, making it especially useful in under-served regions of the world.",
            "The idea of using the immune response from S. epidermidis in the skin to develop therapies \u201cis really out there\u201d, says Thomas Kupper, a skin immunologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cIt is a super-creative application of these findings.\u201d",
            "But Kupper adds that it\u2019s still unclear whether the skin\u2019s response to S. epidermidis is as strong in people as it is in mice. Fischbach notes that early data suggest healthy people have high levels of antibodies against S. epidermidis. But before this approach can be used in people, it must first be proved safe and effective in non-human primates and in humans, following the usual process for developing medicines, he says. \u201cIf this is going to be deployed in the real world, we have to show that it works.\u201d",

            "Researchers hope that the rocks outside of Jezero Crater hold signs of whether Mars might have once sustained extraterrestrial life, when it was warmer and wetter than today. The rover landed in Jezero nearly four years ago and has been exploring the crater\u2019s floor and a fossilized river delta for such signs ever since. Over the course of its 32-kilometre journey, it has drilled rock samples and stored 15 of them in its belly; there are 11 empty tubes remaining that could be filled with additional intriguing rocks from the fresh Martian terrain it now faces.",
            "Perseverance has already placed 10 tubes on the crater floor in a \u2018sample depot\u2019 where a future mission could pick them up. NASA is trying to figure out how to bring any of the samples back to Earth for analysis \u2014 the only way that researchers can study them thoroughly to confirm signs of life. The original plan for bringing them back was estimated to cost up to US$11 billion, and the agency\u2019s budget won\u2019t support such a mission.",

Reaching the crater rim on 11 December meant that the rover climbed more than 500 metres in elevation \u2014 by far its steepest climb since it landed in February 2021. The crater\u2019s edge is a geologically interesting region because Jezero was once filled with an ancient lake, making the rim a shoreline at one time.",
            "Once Perseverance reached the rim this week, at a place dubbed Lookout Hill, mission scientists celebrated by having it take a photo looking both back into the crater and out into the plains beyond. \u201cTo take in the view of where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re going is really very cool,\u201d Farley says.",

Its layers might hold clues to the area\u2019s geological history, says Candice Bedford, a geochemist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. From there, Perseverance will explore rock ridges that could represent an ancient hydrothermal system, where hot water oozed around rocks fractured when a big meteorite hit Mars.",
            "The region might have hosted life at some point, or been conducive to it. It will take some time for researchers to interpret the new rocks and whether they might be promising for signs of life, however, because they are so different than those inside Jezero, Farley says.",

            "The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought to the fore ethical questions that were once confined to the realms of science fiction: if AI systems could one day \u2018think\u2019 like humans, for example, would they also be able to have subjective experiences like humans? Would they experience suffering, and, if so, would humanity be equipped to properly care for them? ",
            "A group of philosophers and computer scientists are arguing that AI welfare should be taken seriously. In a report posted last month on the preprint server arXiv1, ahead of peer review, they call for AI companies not only to assess their systems for evidence of consciousness and the capacity to make autonomous decisions, but also to put in place policies for how to treat the systems if these scenarios become reality.",

            "Some think that, at this stage, the idea that there is a need for AI welfare is laughable. Others are sceptical, but say it doesn\u2019t hurt to start planning. Among them is Anil Seth, a consciousness researcher at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. \u201cThese scenarios might seem outlandish, and it is true that conscious AI may be very far away and might not even be possible. But the implications of its emergence are sufficiently tectonic that we mustn\u2019t ignore the possibility,\u201d he wrote last year in the science magazine Nautilus. \u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t that Frankenstein\u2019s creature came to life; it was that it was conscious and could feel.\u201d",
            "The stakes are getting higher as we become increasingly dependent on these technologies, says Jonathan Mason, a mathematician based in Oxford, UK, who was not involved in producing the report. Mason argues that developing methods for assessing AI systems for consciousness should be a priority. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be sensible to get society to invest so much in something and become so reliant on something that we knew so little about \u2014 that we didn\u2019t even realize that it had perception,\u201d he says.",
            "People might also be harmed if AI systems aren\u2019t tested properly for consciousness, says Jeff Sebo, a philosopher at New York University in New York City and a co-author of the report. If we wrongly assume a system is conscious, he says, welfare funding might be funnelled towards its care, and therefore taken away from people or animals that need it, or \u201cit could lead you to constrain efforts to make AI safe or beneficial for humans\u201d.",

Other countries or regions have introduced similar bans and more say they\u2019re considering them, owing to parents\u2019 concerns that children are being exposed to cyberbullying, scams and adult content on these platforms. But researchers say there is minimal evidence to suggest such bans will keep children safe from online harm.",
            "The Australian government says that social media is impacting children\u2019s well-being. It hasn\u2019t said which platforms will be off-limits under the new law, but the legislation will include those that allow users to post content and interact with two or more users, such as Snapchat, TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). Social-media companies could face fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$32 million) if they don\u2019t take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to prevent children younger than the minimum age from signing up for accounts.",
            "Many parents have applauded the tough approach, but researchers aren\u2019t convinced banning access to social media will solve the problems it is intended to address. In October, dozens of researchers penned a letter to the Australian government arguing that a blanket ban was too blunt and that addressing online risks requires a nuanced, evidence-based approach.",
            "There is a lack of evidence to suggest that a ban will be effective, says Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who focuses on how social media influences mental health. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the scientific consensus,\u201d he says.",

A 2023 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that social media has the potential to be harmful to adolescent health, but that there is not enough evidence to suggest that it causes negative effects at the population level. Rather than bringing in blanket bans and age restrictions, the report recommends that social-media companies adopt new standards to improve the platforms\u2019 transparency, as well as better reporting systems to tackle online abuse.",
            "Australia is one of several countries or regions to attempt to impose social-media restrictions on children. In 2023, France introduced a law that prohibits children under the age of 15 from signing up for social-media accounts without parental consent, although it is yet to be enforced. The US state of Florida signed a bill in March that seeks to ban social-media accounts for children younger than 14 years old, but the move is being challenged in the district court over concerns about free speech. And in October, Norway announced plans to increase the minimum age for social-media use from 13 to 15 years old.",
            "Studies suggest that children are already finding ways around existing age limits. A 2022 report by the UK government\u2019s Office of Communications found that 60% of children aged between 8 and 11 who use these platforms have their own profiles, despite most platforms having an age limit of 13 years old. Furthermore, young users do not need an account to browse some social-media sites, such as TikTok, and can use their parents\u2019 logins to access content on more restrictive sites, says Stephanie Wescott, a researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on gender-based violence in schools. \u201cThere are huge enforceability issues,\u201d she says.",

The changes made to hiring processes are described in a preprint posted to the bioRxiv server last month1. It has not been peer reviewed. ",
            "Christian\u2019s department is not alone in taking action to boost gender diversity among their staff. In 2022, leaders of several departments at the University of Melbourne, Australia, reported the details of affirmative-action recruitment initiatives that led to more female hires.",

            "Committee members were given copies of application documents in which candidates\u2019 names and contact information were redacted, as were references to their institution, country and leaves of absence. Gender, religion, ethnicity, race, age and nationality were also removed. This task was done by the head of the department, Mark Berry, who was not involved in evaluating candidates. His work took, on average, 90 minutes per application. ",
            "The degree type and year of completion remained, as did the location and title of any national or international conference presentations. Publication titles, including the year of publication and journal, also remained. Berry also added candidates\u2019 authorship position in the publications and presentations. ",
            "The redacted versions were then used to draw up a shortlist of around ten candidates for each of the five roles being filled during the study period. ",
            " At that point, the full, unredacted applications, as well as reference letters, were supplied to the search committee, enabling members to check that no candidate had been unfairly disadvantaged by any redactions.",

            "Three or four candidates were then invited to interview. The number of group and one-to-one meetings over the typically two-day process was reduced to decrease applicants\u2019 stress and fatigue. Interviewees were invited to meet with a realtor to discuss housing and living costs.",

All five went to women during the study, compared with just one during the earlier period. The move achieved gender parity in the department. ",
            "Berry says that the search committee\u2019s members responded positively to the redacted documentation, which enabled them to focus on the application. \u201cThey weren\u2019t constantly having to tell themselves not to be biased, they could just relax and turn the brain off and focus on the important stuff,\u201d he adds. ",
            "To rule out the possibility that the selection committee was favouring women over others who were the best person for the job, the team also looked at the success rates of the employed candidates in competitive national funding calls. These matched or exceeded expectations. \u201cThus, our intervention was very successful,\u201d Christian and her colleagues write. ",

Last year, Kewley and colleagues announced that the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions, an Australian astronomy research centre that she had co-founded, had achieved gender parity after a five-year programme of education and affirmative action. In early 2018, 38% of the centre\u2019s roughly 150 personnel were women. But by 2023, half of its more than 300 personnel were women. ",
            "She says there is more evidence that suggests anonymizing applications for processes such as music auditions and telescope time proposals leads to the selection of candidates that are representative of the applicant pool. \u201cThis study shows that these types of anonymization can be applied to academia, something that is often stated is going to be impossible,\u201d she adds. ",
            "But she stresses the sample size is small, and a larger study is required to better evaluate the procedure fully. \u201cIf other departments followed a similar process, then data from each of those could be collected,\u201d she adds. ",
