            "Which scientific publishers and journals are worst affected by fraudulent or dubious research papers \u2014 and which have done least to clean up their portfolio? A technology start-up founded to help publishers spot potentially problematic papers says that it has some answers, and has shared its early findings with Nature. ",
            "The science-integrity website Argos, which was launched in September by Scitility, a technology firm headquartered in Sparks, Nevada, gives papers a risk score on the basis of their authors\u2019 publication records, and on whether the paper heavily cites already-retracted research. A paper categorized as \u2018high risk\u2019 might have multiple authors whose other studies have been retracted for reasons related to misconduct, for example. Having a high score doesn\u2019t prove that a paper is low quality, but suggests that it is worth investigating.",
            "The papers that most heavily cite retracted studies",
            "Argos is one of a growing number of research-integrity tools that look for red flags in papers. These include the Papermill Alarm, made by Clear Skies, and Signals, by Research Signals, both London-based firms. Because creators of such software sell their manuscript-screening tools to publishers, they are generally reluctant to name affected journals. But Argos, which is offering free accounts to individuals and fuller access to science-integrity sleuths and journalists, is the first to show public insights.",
            "\u201cWe wanted to build a piece of technology that was able to see hidden patterns and bring transparency to the industry,\u201d says Scitility co-founder Erik de Boer, who is based in Roosendaal, the Netherlands.",

            "Argos\u2019s analysis shows that the publisher Hindawi \u2014 a now-shuttered subsidiary of the London-based publisher Wiley \u2014 has the highest volume and proportion of already-retracted papers (see \u2018Publishers at risk\u2019). That\u2019s not surprising, because Wiley has retracted more than 10,000 Hindawi-published papers over the past two years in response to concerns raised by editors and sleuths; this amounts to more than 4% of the brand\u2019s total portfolio over the past decade. One of its journals, Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, has retracted 741 papers, more than 7% of its output.",

            "Springer Nature says that it rolled out two tools in June that have since helped to spot hundreds of fake submitted manuscripts; several publishers noted their work with a joint integrity hub that offers software which can flag suspicious papers. Jisuk Kang, a publishing manager at MDPI in Basel, Switzerland, says that products such as Argos can give broad indications of potential issues, but noted that the publisher couldn\u2019t check the accuracy or reliability of the figures on the site. She adds that the largest publishers and journals would inevitably have higher numbers of high-risk papers, so that the share of output is a better metric.",
            "The publishing brands with the greatest proportions of high-risk papers in their portfolios are Impact Journals (0.82%), Spandidos (0.77%) and Ivyspring (0.67%), the Argos figures suggest. Impact Journals tells Nature that, although its journals have experienced problems in the past, they have now improved their integrity. The publisher says that there were \u201c0% irregularities\u201d in its journal Oncotarget over the past two years, owing to the adoption of image-checking tools such as Image Twin, which have become available only in the past few years.

Unsurprisingly, Hindawi titles stand out for both the number and proportion of papers that have been retracted, whereas other journals have a lot of what Argos identified as high-risk work remaining (see \u2018Journals at risk\u2019). By volume, Springer Nature\u2019s mega-journal Scientific Reports leads, with 450 high-risk papers and 231 retractions, together around 0.3% of its output.

Its sources include the website Retraction Watch, which maintains a database of retracted papers \u2014 made free through a deal with the non-profit organization CrossRef \u2014 that includes the reasons for a retraction, so that tools examining author records can focus on retractions that mention misconduct. The analysis also relies on records of articles that heavily cite retracted papers, collated by Guillaume Cabanac, a computer scientist at the University of Toulouse, France. ",
            "Although Argos also follows analysts that focus on networks of authors with a history of misconduct, other research-integrity tools also flag papers on the basis of suspicious content, such as close textual similarity to bogus work, or \u2018tortured phrases\u2019, a term coined by Cabanac, when authors make strange wording choices to avoid triggering plagiarism detectors.",

That is because AI-assisted writing tools might be used to help fraudsters to avoid obvious textual tells, he says. Butcher adds that many major publishers have built or acquired their own integrity tools to screen for various red flags in manuscripts. ",
            "One of the trickiest issues for integrity tools that rely mostly on author retraction records is correctly distinguishing between authors with similar names \u2014 an issue that might skew Argos\u2019s figures. \u201cThe author disambiguation problem is the single biggest problem the industry has,\u201d says Adam Day, founder of Clear Skies.",
            "De Boer, who formerly worked at Springer Nature, says that anyone can create an account to access Argos for free, but Scitility aims to sell a version of the tool to big publishers and institutions, who could plug it directly into their manuscript-screening workflows.",

            "But researchers might have vastly underestimated the energy it takes to reproduce, according to Dustin Marshall, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist at Monash University in Melbourne. Australia.",
            "The extra energy it takes a human to produce a baby could be as much as 24 times more than some influential mathematical models had estimated, suggest Marshall and his colleagues in a study published in May1. For animals that rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature, called ectotherms, the difference is smaller. For the pampas snake (Tomodon dorsatus), for example, the value is around four times more. And for a species of seawater fish called the capelin (Mallotus villosus), it is twice more.",

            "These findings are not merely a curiosity. Researchers use mathematical models to examine how energy needs change during animal lifespans \u2014 during growth, feeding and reproduction, for instance. And these, in turn, feed into explanations of why species evolve in the way that they do, such as the number of offspring that they have, or the benefits of live births over laying eggs.",
            "The work by Marshall\u2019s team suggests that these models\u2019 estimates of the energy requirements of reproduction have often overlooked or underestimated the energy spent by mothers in making and carrying their young \u2014 sometimes referred to as the \u2018indirect\u2019 costs of reproduction, as opposed to the direct cost, the energy invested and stored in the offspring. It is akin to assuming that the energy needed to make a doughnut is equal to the calories in the doughnut itself, and ignoring the fuel required to cook it.",

            "In 2020, Marshall\u2019s team decided to comb the literature for dozens of studies from the 1930s to the 2000s, that had measured either the rate of energy use in pregnant and non-pregnant females or the energy stored directly in the offspring. Overall, the team collated enough data to calculate the indirect and direct costs of reproduction for 81 species, ranging from microscopic animals called rotifers to fishes, snakes and humans.",
            "For the human data, for instance, the researchers drew on a 2004 paper that measured the metabolic rate of humans before and during pregnancy2. They used this to estimate the extra energy required during nine months of pregnancy \u2014 the indirect costs \u2014 and combined that with estimated direct costs, such as the total energy content of a newborn baby.",

            "Besides the night shifts, other issues make it hard to track energy use during pregnancy for periods much longer than one day. \u201cIf it was longer than that, you\u2019d have to figure out a way to remove the poo and waste from the pigs without breaking the seal of the chamber,\u201d he says. It\u2019s not surprising that such measurements are rare in the literature, says Marshall.",
            "Instead, modellers have found it easier to calculate the energy stored in offspring \u2014 by simply estimating the amount of bone, fat and protein in the bodies of offspring and combining that with the known energy content of those components. Modellers assumed that this equalled the energy cost of reproduction. Some models have included estimates of indirect costs, but these costs were assumed to range from just 5% to 25% of the total energy spent on reproduction, depending on the model.",

            "In mammals, which often grow placentas to provide oxygen and nutrients and to remove waste, and which maintain a stable internal body temperature, the researchers found that the indirect costs made up roughly 90% of the total energy costs of reproduction. Just 10% of the total energy is contained in the offspring. In humans, 96% of the 208,000 kilojoules (or nearly 50,000 kilocalories) required for reproduction is taken up by indirect costs.",
            "By contrast, ectotherms invest less of their total reproductive energy budget in indirect costs, the researchers found. In ectotherms that give birth to live young, the indirect costs made up roughly 55% on average of their reproductive energy.",

Including weaning for babies after birth \u2014 such as the extra energy needed to produce milk \u2014 would add even more costs.",

Still others, he says, are surprised that mathematical treatments of life had assumed such costs to be zero or low.",

            "The larger energy estimates should be plugged into models of how animals live, says Asta Audzijonyte at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, who models how fish are faring amid climate change. It will take time to make these revisions, says Marshall, because rewriting the models is not straightforward. But, in turn, this could shift the weight of evidence behind some theories as to why animals live the way they do, such as whether fish hit a maximum body size to conserve energy for reproduction, he says.",
            "Fresh estimates for reproductive energy use could also improve predictions of how species will evolve amid climate change, says Audzijonyte. This is because predictive models take into account factors such as the energy demands of reproduction, how heat alters the speed of reactions inside animals\u2019 bodies and how big animals grow.",
            "The study by Marshall and his team is just the first step towards quantifying the costs of reproduction across the animal kingdom, he says. Owing to scant data, the researchers often had to extrapolate the costs of pregnancy from measurements taken at just a few points during gestation, which limits the accuracy of their estimates, says Marshall. In future, studies that measure the indirect costs of reproduction throughout the entire gestation period will be needed, he says.",

Today, more than 150 million people of reproductive age globally take oral contraceptives, placing them among the most-used medications in the world. Many take the pill for reasons unrelated to conception, such as managing acne, regulating menstrual cycles or helping to relieve menstrual symptoms and migraines.",
            "Decades of data on these medicines suggest that they are generally safe, but their effects on the brain remain understudied. For example, although some people report that they experience decreased depression and anxiety, others find that these symptoms worsen \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear why.",
            "Many people begin taking the pill during puberty, which is a crucial time for brain maturation, so it\u2019s important to understand how it affects neurodevelopment, says Kathryn Lenz, a behavioural neuroscientist at The Ohio State University in Columbus.",
            "h2The adaptable brain",
            "Most neuroimaging experiments use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology to scan the brains of 10\u201330 participants only once or twice, which is costly to perform. This approach fails to account for daily variation in brain morphology and connectivity.",
            "A growing number of neuroimaging studies instead use a technique called \u2018dense sampling\u2019, in which researchers scan a single or handful of participants repeatedly to build a high-resolution data set. Dense sampling captures observations that might otherwise be overlooked, but the small sample size results in limited generalizability of findings to larger populations.",
            "Even so, by comparing data sets between participants \u2014 especially those who have different reactions to the pill \u2014 researchers might be able to pinpoint what drives different side effects.",

            "Using this approach, Heller scanned herself 25 times over 5 weeks, capturing images at different stages of her natural menstrual cycle. A few months later, she began taking oral contraceptives and then waited 3 months before scanning herself another 25 times in 5 weeks. At that point, Heller ceased taking the pill, waited another 3 months and scanned herself a final 25 times over 5 weeks. She also had blood drawn and completed a survey about her mood after each scan.",
            "Heller found a rhythmic pattern of change in brain volume and connectivity between brain regions over the course of her menstrual cycle, with volume and connectivity dipping slightly while she was taking oral contraceptives. (Higher brain volume or connectivity does not imply improved brain function, and vice versa.)",
            "This pattern largely returned to its former state after she stopped taking the medication, showing that the brain is \u201cquite adaptable\u201d, says Laura Pritschet, who conducted her graduate work with Jacobs and is now a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.",
            "h2An expanding network",
            "Heller drew inspiration from a study in which Pritschet scanned her own brain for 30 consecutive days during her natural menstrual cycle and for 30 more days while taking oral contraceptives. This was part of a project that Pritschet calls 28andMe: the name is a nod to the consumer-genetics firm 23andMe in South San Francisco, California, and the 28 days in a canonical menstrual cycle.",
            "Data from Pritschet\u2019s project showed that higher levels of oestrogen drive certain important brain networks to become more functionally connected1. One of these was the \u2018default mode network\u2019, which is active during daydreaming and is involved in memory. Progesterone had the opposite effect. Pritschet also scanned her husband over 30 consecutive days in a spin-off project called 28andHe, to understand the effects of hormone fluctuations in the male brain2.",
            "Next, Heller plans to compare her data with those from a woman with endometriosis, a painful condition that affects up to 10% of women at reproductive age, to understand whether hormone fluctuations in the brain could be driving the condition.",

Since 1994, the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) has been challenging scientists to predict the 3D shape of proteins from their amino-acid sequences. Winners of the competition \u2014 founded by computational biologist John Moult at the University of Maryland in Rockville and Krzysztof Fidelis, a computational biologist at the University of California, Davis \u2014 are determined by comparing the computational predictions with unpublished structural models.",

For example, fasting has been shown to reduce the number of circulating monocytes, cells that defend the body against foreign invaders but that can be a hallmark of several autoimmune conditions3.",
            "Some researchers think that they can use such evidence to treat people with these conditions without them needing to eat less. For instance, Cheng Zhan, a neuroscientist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei, wanted to investigate a group of neurons in the brainstem that helps to regulate the immune system, to see whether manipulating them could elicit the desired effect.",
            "Yo-yo dieting accelerates cardiovascular disease by reprogramming the immune system",
            "In a paper published in January, Zhan and his team demonstrated that these neurons were activated in mice in response to fasting, and that they caused T cells to retreat from the blood, spleen and lymph nodes to their central reservoir, the bone marrow4. Zhan also used a mouse model of the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis to show that the continuous activation of these neurons significantly alleviated paralysis, prevented disease-related weight loss and increased survival.",

For example, it could blunt immune responses. In a study published last year, Filip Swirski, an immunologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and his colleagues recorded a 90% reduction in monocytes circulating in the blood of fasting mice, and an increase in these cells in the bone marrow, where they are produced5.",
            "When the mice were fed after fasting for 24 hours, the monocytes flooded back into the blood in unusually large numbers, causing monocytosis, a condition usually associated with infectious and autoimmune disease. These post-fasting monocytes also lived longer than normal and had a lower-than-usual threshold for triggering inflammation. When the researchers infected the mice that had fasted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, the animals died sooner and in larger numbers than did non-fasted controls.",

The switch to the high-fat diet suppressed immunity and made mice more susceptible to bacterial infection6. It reduced the number and undermined the function of certain T cells that help the body to detect and memorize pathogens; further tests showed that the lack of fibre impaired the gut microbiome, which usually supports these T cells. \u201cI was surprised that changing the diet for just three days was enough time to see these dramatic effects on adaptive immune-system cells,\u201d adds Siracusa.",
            "When Siracusa asked six human volunteers to switch from a high-fibre to low-fibre diet, he saw similar effects on their T cells. The effects \u2014 as with any holiday feast \u2014 were transient, but Siracusa thinks that looking at these early immune events relating to changes in diet could reveal insights into the causes of chronic immune conditions. However, he emphasizes that he would not make dietary recommendations on the basis of this small proof-of-principle experiment. Furthermore, work in mice can provide only clues as to what happens in humans.",

Over the past decade, they have done a number of trials in which volunteers agreed to be confined to a ward at a US National Institutes of Health research hospital, in which their diets could be strictly controlled and their responses measured.",
            "Although Hall\u2019s main interests revolve around the effects of different diets on metabolism and body composition \u2014 his group has studied the effects of ultraprocessed foods on weight gain, for example \u2014 for a 2024 study, he worked with immunologist Yasmine Belkaid, then at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in Bethesda, to investigate immune-system changes prompted by different diets.",

            "Hall and Belkaid, who is now president of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, enlisted 20 adults for a four-week hospital stay and randomized them to follow either a ketogenic diet (one based on animal products and with low levels of carbohydrate) or a vegan, low-fat diet for the first two weeks, then the alternate diet for the final two weeks. Blood samples showed that shifting to either diet was linked to clear changes in both the numbers of different immune cells and which genes were being activated in them7.",
            "While on the ketogenic diet, participants had enhanced levels and activity of T and B cells that form part of the adaptive immune system, which mounts a \u2018precision\u2019 response that recognizes specific foes. Those on the vegan diet saw enhanced innate immune responses, which are quicker and less specific than adaptive responses. Belkaid was delighted to see such clear results and is excited at their clinical potential, but refuses to offer dietary advice on the basis of them at this stage. Yet, despite differences in age, genetics and body weight, she says, \u201cit was surprising to see how convergent the immune-system effects were\u201d in just two weeks. \u201cThe next step is to test dietary interventions for specific conditions in clinical trials that are as rigorous as those we do for drugs,\u201d she says.",
            "Hall\u2019s group is considering including people with lupus in a study, to compare the effects of different diets. Others have done preliminary studies on the use of ketogenic diets as add-on therapies for psoriasis8 and type 1 diabetes9. There has also been a substantial increase in research into the use of diet and nutrition to boost the effects of therapies that co-opt the immune system to target cancer10. One study, published in 2021, found that higher dietary-fibre consumption was associated with improved survival in people receiving an immunotherapy for melanoma, and that mice with melanomas and that were fed a low-fibre diet had fewer killer T cells \u2014 which attack cancer cells \u2014 near their tumours11.",
            "Belkaid acknowledges there is still much more work to do to unpick the effects of specific diets on the immune systems of those with different health conditions. However, she and Siracusa are among a growing group of immunologists who are optimistic that the mechanistic insights they and others are uncovering are the first steps towards personalized diets for a range of medical conditions. \u201cI can imagine a world, in the next 10 years, in which we have access to rigorous dietary advice that can be applied in a range of clinical settings,\u201d she says. \u201cI think highly informed nutrition has enormous clinical potential.\u201d",

            "China is now home to the world\u2019s most powerful resistive magnet, which produced a magnetic field that was more than 800,000 times stronger than Earth\u2019s.",
            "On 22 September, the magnet, at the Steady High Magnetic Field Facility (SHMFF) at the Chinese Academy of Science\u2019s Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, sustained a steady magnetic field of 42.02 tesla. This milestone narrowly surpasses the 41.4-tesla record set in 2017 by a resistive magnet at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida. Resistive magnets are made of coiled metal wires and are widely used in magnet facilities across the world.",
            "China\u2019s record-breaker lays the groundwork for building reliable magnets that can sustain ever-stronger magnetic fields, which would help researchers to discover surprising new physics, says Joachim Wosnitza, a physicist at the Dresden High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Germany.",
            "The resistive magnet \u2014 which is open to international users \u2014 is the country\u2019s second major contribution to the global quest to produce ever-higher magnetic fields. In 2022, the SHMFF\u2019s hybrid magnet, which combines a resistive magnet with a superconducting one, produced a field of 45.22 tesla, making it the most powerful working steady-state magnet in the world.",
            "h2Research tool",
            "High-field magnets are handy tools for uncovering hidden properties of advanced materials, such as superconductors \u2014 materials that, under very low temperatures, carry electric current without producing waste heat. High fields also offer the chance to glimpse entirely new physical phenomena, says Marc-Henri Julien, a condensed-matter physicist at the National Laboratory for Intense Magnetic Fields in Grenoble, France. \u201cYou can create or manipulate new states of matter,\u201d says Julien.",
            "High fields are also useful for experiments that rely on very sensitive measurements, because they boost the resolution and make it easier to see faint phenomena, says Alexander Eaton, a condensed-matter physicist at the University of Cambridge, UK. \u201cEvery extra tesla is exponentially better than the last,\u201d he says.",
            "Guangli Kuang, a physicist who specializes in high magnetic fields at the SHMFF, says the team spent years modifying the magnet to hit the latest record. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to achieve,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Reliable but costly",
            "Resistive magnets are an older technology, but they can sustain high magnetic fields for longer periods than can their newer hybrid and fully superconducting counterparts, says Wosnitza. Their magnetic fields can also be ramped up much quicker, making them versatile experimental tools. \u201cYou can just twist a knob and go from zero tesla to high fields within minutes,\u201d he says.",
            "The big drawback of resistive magnets is the amount of power they consume, making them costly, says Eaton. For instance, the SHMFF\u2019s resistive magnet drew 32.3 megawatts of electricity to produce its record-breaking field. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a very good science case to justify that resource,\u201d says Eaton.",
            "That challenge is driving the race to develop hybrid and fully superconducting magnets that can generate high fields using less power. In 2019, NHMFL researchers built a miniature, proof-of-concept superconducting magnet that briefly sustained a 45.5-tesla field, and are currently developing a larger 40-tesla superconducting magnet that can be used for experiments. The team at the SHMFF is building a 55-tesla hybrid one. Although these newer magnets are expected to be cheaper to run than their resistive counterparts, they come with their own hurdles: they are more expensive to build and require complicated cooling systems, says engineer Mark Bird, a co-leader of the NHMFL\u2019s magnet science and technology division. \u201cThe technology is still being developed, and the costs are not clear yet,\u201d says Bird.",
