            "The observations are a double-edged sword, says Nicole Bell, a theoretical physicist at the University of Melbourne, Australia. On the one hand, it means that detectors have become sensitive enough to pick up signals of dark matter \u2014 the mysterious substance thought to make up the bulk of matter in the Universe. On the other, it means that the neutrino signals could obscure the dark-matter signals that scientists are so eager to observe. The findings were published in two papers in Physical Review Letters last month1,2.",
            "Every second, trillions of neutrinos stream through Earth \u2014 unnoticed, because they barely interact with ordinary matter. Most of these almost massless particles are produced by fusion reactions in the Sun, such as those that trigger the radioactive \u03b2-decay of the isotope boron-8.",
            "Physicists have long predicted that dark-matter experiments will eventually catch a glimpse of this neutrino fog, formerly known as the neutrino floor, says Fei Gao, an experimental particle physicist at Tsinghua University in Beijing. He works on the XENONnt dark-matter experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory just outside L\u2019Aquila, Italy.",
            "The neutrino fog is also exciting because measuring it confirms that dark-matter experiments are capable of observing all \u2018flavours\u2019 of neutrinos flying in from the Sun and even from exploding stars in nearby galaxies, says Kate Scholberg, an experimental particle physicist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cYou could learn something about the total spectrum of all neutrinos,\u201d she says.",

They focused on detecting neutrinos that slammed into xenon atoms\u2019 whole nuclei rather than their individual parts, a process known as coherent elastic neutrino\u2013nucleus scattering. These events produce signals that are remarkably similar to those that will be produced if certain types of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) \u2014 the leading candidate group for dark matter \u2014 hit a xenon nucleus.",
            "The XENONnT researchers analysed their data set using an array of machine-learning techniques and concluded that the detector had captured 11 instances of solar neutrinos crashing into xenon nuclei1. Meanwhile, the PandaX-4T team detected 75 of these events2 by reducing the experiment\u2019s detection threshold to 0.33 kiloelectronvolts \u2014 an order of magnitude lower than most WIMP searches, says team member Qing Lin, an experimental particle physicist at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. This made the experiment more sensitive to the faintest neutrino signals, but meant that the data set was noisier than XENONnT\u2019s because it included more signals from radiation and electrons.",

On Earth, rocks that have such patterns can host microbes: chemical reactions causing the dark rims to form serve as an energy source for the microorganisms.",

Organic compounds can be made by living organisms or through non-living processes, but researchers are optimistic about this sample hinting at ancient life because of the combination of the spotting pattern, the detection of the organic compounds, and evidence that water flowed through the site. \u201cThis is something we will be looking at very, very carefully for years to come,\u201d says Meenakshi Wadhwa, a planetary scientist at Arizona State University in Tempe who is NASA\u2019s principal scientist for Mars sample return.",

It hasn\u2019t said which platforms will be off-limits under the new law, but the legislation will include those that allow users to post content and interact with two or more users, such as Snapchat, TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). Social-media companies could face fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$32 million) if they don\u2019t take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to prevent children younger than the minimum age from signing up for accounts.",
            "Many parents have applauded the tough approach, but researchers aren\u2019t convinced banning access to social media will solve the problems it is intended to address. In October, dozens of researchers penned a letter to the Australian government arguing that a blanket ban was too blunt and that addressing online risks requires a nuanced, evidence-based approach.",
            "There is a lack of evidence to suggest that a ban will be effective, says Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who focuses on how social media influences mental health. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the scientific consensus,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Evidence so far",
            "So what does the research show? A 2023 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that social media has the potential to be harmful to adolescent health, but that there is not enough evidence to suggest that it causes negative effects at the population level. Rather than bringing in blanket bans and age restrictions, the report recommends that social-media companies adopt new standards to improve the platforms\u2019 transparency, as well as better reporting systems to tackle online abuse.",
            "Australia is one of several countries or regions to attempt to impose social-media restrictions on children. In 2023, France introduced a law that prohibits children under the age of 15 from signing up for social-media accounts without parental consent, although it is yet to be enforced. The US state of Florida signed a bill in March that seeks to ban social-media accounts for children younger than 14 years old, but the move is being challenged in the district court over concerns about free speech. And in October, Norway announced plans to increase the minimum age for social-media use from 13 to 15 years old.",

            "Around three out of every four PDF versions of scholarly papers are largely inaccessible to low-vision and blind readers, a study has found1.",
            "Researchers looked at how often around 20,000 studies published between 2014 and 2023 were compliant with 6 accessibility criteria. That includes providing alternative text for figures and headers for tables, as well as adding the tags necessary to make PDF files accessible to low-vision and blind readers, who typically access these files using assistive reading devices.",
            "Only around 3% of the analysed studies met all six criteria, the analysis found, and just under 75% met none of the criteria at all. ",
            "\u201cAfter 2019, there was a very sharp decline across almost all of the criteria that we measured,\u201d says study co-author Anukriti Kumar, an information scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors attribute that trend to the move towards rapid-publishing methods such as preprints and online-first publishing, and say that it was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded quick communication of research findings.",
            "The analysis was presented in October at the 26th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility in St. John\u2019s, Canada.",
            "Lucy Lu Wang, also an information scientist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study, published2 a similar analysis of accessibility of more than 11,000 PDFs in 2021. \u201cThings were mostly improving,\u201d she recalls. But with new global open-access policies and changes with how publishers are producing PDFs, accessibility overall has decreased since then,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cAccessibility often falls to the wayside, because it disproportionately affects a smaller group of people,\u201d Wang says, \u201cor the kind of people who don\u2019t have as much clout.\u201d",
            "h2Systemic changes required",
            "For the 2021 analysis, the authors interviewed several low-vision and blind scientists, some of whom said that they chose their fields of study in part because of how easily accessible the associated literature was. \u201cPeople were drawn to fields that had more accessible papers,\u201d Wang says. \u201cThe barriers to working in those fields were lower.\u201d",
            "Sheri Wells-Jensen, a linguistics researcher at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who is fully blind, tells Nature that the hassle of finding accessible papers is such that she sometimes doesn\u2019t even try. \u201cI never expect to be able to go to an open-access journal and just get the PDF and read it with the same level of ease and convenience as other scientists do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got different software that could do some scanning, but you have to be a little bit of a wizard sometimes.\u201d",
            "Wells-Jensen notes that academic journals rarely provide information about accessibility for scientists with visual impairment in the \u2018information for authors\u2019 sections of their websites, making it unclear how researchers should prepare their manuscripts for optimal accessibility. Manuscript-submission systems themselves are also often inaccessible, she adds.",
            "Addressing such accessibility shortfalls will require \u201csystemic changes\u201d from authors, publishers and others, Kumar says.",

            "Concealing some of the information on job applications led to more women being hired.Credit: Christopher Ames/Getty",
            "In 2017, when Sherri Christian returned to her institution after a year-long sabbatical, she looked around the biochemistry department and realized that she was the last female hire, seven years earlier. At the time, there were 19 members, just 6 of them women, including her. ",
            "During her sabbatical, Christian attended a talk about diversity and inclusion at a Canadian Society for Immunology meeting at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Inspired by what she learnt, Christian and her colleagues set about making hiring diversity a priority. ",
            "By this year, her department at the Memorial University of Newfoundland Faculty of Medicine in St John\u2019s, Canada, had managed to achieve gender parity. The changes made to hiring processes are described in a preprint posted to the bioRxiv server last month1. It has not been peer reviewed. ",
            "Christian\u2019s department is not alone in taking action to boost gender diversity among their staff. In 2022, leaders of several departments at the University of Melbourne, Australia, reported the details of affirmative-action recruitment initiatives that led to more female hires.",
            "And this year, the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands revealed the results of a five-year policy stating that only female applicants would be considered for permanent academic roles during the first six months of recruitment. The controversial policy led to 50% of all new hires being women, up from 30% previously. ",
            "h2Loneliness ",
            "When the Newfoundland project started in 2020, Christian was the only woman to have been hired in ten years. \u201cIt was a bit lonely,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d look around and there\u2019d be no women on the committee you are sitting in, or it would be the same other person over and over again because there are only so many people to choose from.\u201d ",
            "Between 2020 and 2024, the department\u2019s job postings emphasized the equity, diversity and inclusion aspects of the application process for entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. ",
            "But the main change was anonymizing job applications in an attempt to stamp out implicit bias on search committees. ",
            "Committee members were given copies of application documents in which candidates\u2019 names and contact information were redacted, as were references to their institution, country and leaves of absence. Gender, religion, ethnicity, race, age and nationality were also removed. This task was done by the head of the department, Mark Berry, who was not involved in evaluating candidates. His work took, on average, 90 minutes per application. ",
            "The degree type and year of completion remained, as did the location and title of any national or international conference presentations. Publication titles, including the year of publication and journal, also remained. Berry also added candidates\u2019 authorship position in the publications and presentations. ",
            "The redacted versions were then used to draw up a shortlist of around ten candidates for each of the five roles being filled during the study period. ",
            " At that point, the full, unredacted applications, as well as reference letters, were supplied to the search committee, enabling members to check that no candidate had been unfairly disadvantaged by any redactions.",
            "One member, for example, said the unredacted version enabled them to see the full extent of one candidate\u2019s outreach activity, which had been redacted because much of it was focused on women in science. ",
            "Three or four candidates were then invited to interview. The number of group and one-to-one meetings over the typically two-day process was reduced to decrease applicants\u2019 stress and fatigue. Interviewees were invited to meet with a realtor to discuss housing and living costs.",
            "h2Biased ",
            "The authors found the redactions led to a \u201csubstantial difference\u201d in the number of female candidates offered positions. They compared the genders of candidates interviewed and hired for five jobs between 2010 and 2020, and between 2021 and 2024. All five went to women during the study, compared with just one during the earlier period. The move achieved gender parity in the department. ",
            "Berry says that the search committee\u2019s members responded positively to the redacted documentation, which enabled them to focus on the application. \u201cThey weren\u2019t constantly having to tell themselves not to be biased, they could just relax and turn the brain off and focus on the important stuff,\u201d he adds. ",
            "To rule out the possibility that the selection committee was favouring women over others who were the best person for the job, the team also looked at the success rates of the employed candidates in competitive national funding calls. These matched or exceeded expectations. \u201cThus, our intervention was very successful,\u201d Christian and her colleagues write. ",
            "\u201cThis is an important and promising study,\u201d says Lisa Kewley, an astronomer at the Harvard and Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. Last year, Kewley and colleagues announced that the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions, an Australian astronomy research centre that she had co-founded, had achieved gender parity after a five-year programme of education and affirmative action. In early 2018, 38% of the centre\u2019s roughly 150 personnel were women. But by 2023, half of its more than 300 personnel were women. ",
            "She says there is more evidence that suggests anonymizing applications for processes such as music auditions and telescope time proposals leads to the selection of candidates that are representative of the applicant pool. \u201cThis study shows that these types of anonymization can be applied to academia, something that is often stated is going to be impossible,\u201d she adds. ",
            "But she stresses the sample size is small, and a larger study is required to better evaluate the procedure fully. \u201cIf other departments followed a similar process, then data from each of those could be collected,\u201d she adds. ",
            "Aikaterini Fotopoulou, a neuropsychologist at University College London, says that the small scale of the project works in its favour. Fotopoulou, who runs an institute designed to enshrine inclusivity in all aspects of neuroscience and psychology research, says that often the best way to achieve change is not by big projects, but by \u201csmall, specific, localized but impactful action\u201d. ",
            "Sarah Laframboise, who heads up Evidence for Democracy, a grass-roots organization in Ottawa that advocates for the use of science in policy decisions, adds that small projects also create the momentum needed for broader institutional changes. \u201cIt sets a valuable example that can inspire other departments and institutions to take similar steps,\u201d she adds.",
