            "The observations are a double-edged sword, says Nicole Bell, a theoretical physicist at the University of Melbourne, Australia. On the one hand, it means that detectors have become sensitive enough to pick up signals of dark matter \u2014 the mysterious substance thought to make up the bulk of matter in the Universe. On the other, it means that the neutrino signals could obscure the dark-matter signals that scientists are so eager to observe. The findings were published in two papers in Physical Review Letters last month1,2.",
            "Every second, trillions of neutrinos stream through Earth \u2014 unnoticed, because they barely interact with ordinary matter. Most of these almost massless particles are produced by fusion reactions in the Sun, such as those that trigger the radioactive \u03b2-decay of the isotope boron-8.",

This is the inverse of what we expected, and the finding seems to hold true in humans.\u201d",

One of the most common forms is time-restricted eating, which involves eating only within a limited time frame each day.",

This activity helped to repair damage in the animals\u2019 intestines.",
            "To learn whether dieting affects hair regrowth, which can be affected by stress, Bing Zhang, a regenerative biologist at Westlake University in Zhejiang, China, and his colleagues shaved mice and subjected them to one of two intermittent-fasting regimens: time-restricted eating and alternate-day fasting, in which animals fasted for 24 hours and then ate their normal diet for the following 24 hours. By the end of the three-month study, the dieting mice had not regrown as much hair as control animals that ate a similar number of calories, the authors found.",

            "The researchers traced this effect to the death of hair-follicle stem cells. Further experiments showed that intermittent fasting kick-started communication between the adrenal glands, organs that produce stress hormones, and fat cells in the skin. This crosstalk caused skin fat cells to release molecules called fatty acids. The fatty acids disrupted the stem cells\u2019 metabolism and caused damage that, in some cases, led to the stem cells\u2019 death. Application of an antioxidant cream before and during the diet prevented stunting of hair growth, suggesting that this effect is not inevitable.",

            "Nature contacted four leading AI firms to ask about their plans for AI welfare. Three \u2014 Anthropic, Google and Microsoft \u2014 declined to comment, and OpenAI, based in San Francisco, did not respond.",
            "Some are yet to be convinced that AI consciousness should be a priority. In September, the United Nations High-level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence issued a report on how the world should govern AI technology. The document did not address the subject of AI consciousness, despite a call from a group of scientists for the body to support research assessing consciousness in machines.",
            "\u201cThis speaks to a deeper challenge or difficulty with communicating this issue to the wider community,\u201d Mason says.",
            "h2Operating under uncertainty",
            "Although it remains unclear whether AI systems will ever achieve consciousness \u2014 a state that\u2019s difficult to assess even in humans and animals \u2014 uncertainty shouldn\u2019t discourage efforts to develop protocols for evaluating the situation, Sebo says. As a preliminary step, a group of scientists last year published a checklist of criteria that could help to identify systems with a high chance of being conscious. \u201cEven an imperfect initial framework can still be better than the status quo,\u201d Sebo says.",
            "Nevertheless, the authors of the latest report say that the discussion about AI welfare should not come at the expense of other important issues, such as making AI development safe for people. \u201cYou can commit to working to make AI systems safe and beneficial for all,\u201d the authors say in the report. \u201cIncluding humans, animals, and \u2014 if and when the time comes \u2014 AI systems.\u201d",

            "A year from now, children under the age of 16 in Australia will be barred from many social-media platforms \u2014 the highest minimum-age limit in the world. Other countries or regions have introduced similar bans and more say they\u2019re considering them, owing to parents\u2019 concerns that children are being exposed to cyberbullying, scams and adult content on these platforms. But researchers say there is minimal evidence to suggest such bans will keep children safe from online harm.",
            "The Australian government says that social media is impacting children\u2019s well-being. It hasn\u2019t said which platforms will be off-limits under the new law, but the legislation will include those that allow users to post content and interact with two or more users, such as Snapchat, TikTok and X (formerly known as Twitter). Social-media companies could face fines of up to Aus$49.5 million (US$32 million) if they don\u2019t take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to prevent children younger than the minimum age from signing up for accounts.",
            "Many parents have applauded the tough approach, but researchers aren\u2019t convinced banning access to social media will solve the problems it is intended to address. In October, dozens of researchers penned a letter to the Australian government arguing that a blanket ban was too blunt and that addressing online risks requires a nuanced, evidence-based approach.",
            "There is a lack of evidence to suggest that a ban will be effective, says Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, UK, who focuses on how social media influences mental health. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the scientific consensus,\u201d he says.",
            "h2Evidence so far",
            "So what does the research show? A 2023 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine found that social media has the potential to be harmful to adolescent health, but that there is not enough evidence to suggest that it causes negative effects at the population level. Rather than bringing in blanket bans and age restrictions, the report recommends that social-media companies adopt new standards to improve the platforms\u2019 transparency, as well as better reporting systems to tackle online abuse.",
            "Australia is one of several countries or regions to attempt to impose social-media restrictions on children. In 2023, France introduced a law that prohibits children under the age of 15 from signing up for social-media accounts without parental consent, although it is yet to be enforced. The US state of Florida signed a bill in March that seeks to ban social-media accounts for children younger than 14 years old, but the move is being challenged in the district court over concerns about free speech. And in October, Norway announced plans to increase the minimum age for social-media use from 13 to 15 years old.",
            "Studies suggest that children are already finding ways around existing age limits. A 2022 report by the UK government\u2019s Office of Communications found that 60% of children aged between 8 and 11 who use these platforms have their own profiles, despite most platforms having an age limit of 13 years old. Furthermore, young users do not need an account to browse some social-media sites, such as TikTok, and can use their parents\u2019 logins to access content on more restrictive sites, says Stephanie Wescott, a researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on gender-based violence in schools. \u201cThere are huge enforceability issues,\u201d she says.",
            "h2Online community",
            "Because few jurisdictions have banned social media for children, few studies have explored whether such restrictions protect children against online harassment, bullying and harmful content. There is, however, evidence that social media offers adolescents some benefits.",
            "In a 2022 survey conducted in the United States by the Pew Research Center, based in Washington DC, roughly 80% of 13\u201317-year-olds surveyed said that social media made them feel more connected to what\u2019s happening in their friends\u2019 lives. Among the 32% of respondents who reported that social media has a mostly positive impact on them, almost half cited connections and socializing as the main reasons. Almost 60% said that social media had a neutral effect on them, whereas only 9% found it mostly negative.",
            "For some children, particularly those in minority groups and those living in remote areas, social media is a \u201clifeline\u201d, because it gives them access to communities and support systems they might not have at home or at school, says Lisa Given, an information scientist at RMIT University in Melbourne who specializes in human behaviour. Australia\u2019s tough social-media restrictions could isolate these children. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need many more interventions in terms of support and care for those kids who are now banned from these platforms,\u201d she says.",
            "Przybylski worries that the country\u2019s blunt approach will only push vulnerable children to corners of the Internet where they are more likely to be exposed to harm, such as unmoderated chat rooms.",
            "Westcott says governments should focus on educating children from an early age about the pitfalls of social media and how to navigate the online world more critically.",

            "Around three out of every four PDF versions of scholarly papers are largely inaccessible to low-vision and blind readers, a study has found1.",
            "Researchers looked at how often around 20,000 studies published between 2014 and 2023 were compliant with 6 accessibility criteria. That includes providing alternative text for figures and headers for tables, as well as adding the tags necessary to make PDF files accessible to low-vision and blind readers, who typically access these files using assistive reading devices.",
            "Only around 3% of the analysed studies met all six criteria, the analysis found, and just under 75% met none of the criteria at all. ",
            "\u201cAfter 2019, there was a very sharp decline across almost all of the criteria that we measured,\u201d says study co-author Anukriti Kumar, an information scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. The authors attribute that trend to the move towards rapid-publishing methods such as preprints and online-first publishing, and say that it was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded quick communication of research findings.",
            "The analysis was presented in October at the 26th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility in St. John\u2019s, Canada.",
            "Lucy Lu Wang, also an information scientist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study, published2 a similar analysis of accessibility of more than 11,000 PDFs in 2021. \u201cThings were mostly improving,\u201d she recalls. But with new global open-access policies and changes with how publishers are producing PDFs, accessibility overall has decreased since then,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cAccessibility often falls to the wayside, because it disproportionately affects a smaller group of people,\u201d Wang says, \u201cor the kind of people who don\u2019t have as much clout.\u201d",
            "h2Systemic changes required",
            "For the 2021 analysis, the authors interviewed several low-vision and blind scientists, some of whom said that they chose their fields of study in part because of how easily accessible the associated literature was. \u201cPeople were drawn to fields that had more accessible papers,\u201d Wang says. \u201cThe barriers to working in those fields were lower.\u201d",
            "Sheri Wells-Jensen, a linguistics researcher at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, who is fully blind, tells Nature that the hassle of finding accessible papers is such that she sometimes doesn\u2019t even try. \u201cI never expect to be able to go to an open-access journal and just get the PDF and read it with the same level of ease and convenience as other scientists do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got different software that could do some scanning, but you have to be a little bit of a wizard sometimes.\u201d",
            "Wells-Jensen notes that academic journals rarely provide information about accessibility for scientists with visual impairment in the \u2018information for authors\u2019 sections of their websites, making it unclear how researchers should prepare their manuscripts for optimal accessibility. Manuscript-submission systems themselves are also often inaccessible, she adds.",
            "Addressing such accessibility shortfalls will require \u201csystemic changes\u201d from authors, publishers and others, Kumar says.",
            "Todd Carpenter, executive director of the National Information Standards Organization, a non-profit group based in Baltimore, Maryland, which develops technical standards for publishers and libraries, suggests that an audit of publishers\u2019 production processes would be useful. \u201cWhile author guidance is important,\u201d he notes, \u201cthis is primarily a publisher production process, more so than it is an authoring process.\u201d As publishers strive to boost efficiency and cut costs, \u201csometimes the critical components, such as accessibility support, end up on the cutting-room floor\u201d.",
            "\u201cImproving PDF accessibility requires changes to culture, systems and processes that can be challenging for publishers and authors to achieve,\u201d says a spokesperson for Springer Nature, which publishes Nature. (Nature is independent of its publisher.) \u201cWe provide support to staff and editors around ways in which to achieve this, which can include \u2014 improving contrast between text and background, optimizing colour, making links more descriptive, increasing font size, and ensuring that content such as rich media and tables have alternative text provided.\u201d",
            "A spokesperson for scientific publisher Wiley adds: \u201cWe are engaged in several ongoing projects to improve the accessibility of our platforms and our content, including those that deliver PDF accessibility, with the aim of ensuring that customers have equal access to research regardless of age, ability or situation.\u201d",
            "With all the challenges the world is facing, equal access is more important than ever, Wells-Jensen says: \u201cWe really can\u2019t afford to give disincentives to any kind of scientist who is working hard to solve any kind of problem.\u201d",
