            "Plenty of species have gone to space. Monkeys and dogs were among the first astronauts and cosmonauts. Those animals were sent on missions to see how space travel might affect people. (Spoiler: They didn\u2019t always survive.) Then humans took to space. And they have since ferried everything from frogs and butterflies to lettuce and flowers to the International Space Station, or ISS. There, astronauts run experiments to test how life fares beyond our home planet.",
            "But most organisms have spent their out-of-this-world journeys onboard spacecraft. Inside those vehicles, living things have air to breathe. They\u2019re shielded against the extreme temperature swings of outer space. And they\u2019re somewhat sheltered from the radiation that fills the cosmos.",
            "Few life forms have ever been sent into the void of outer space and lived for scientists to tell their tales. Among that elite club of survivors are moss spores, bacteria, plant seeds and tardigrades.",
            "Moss only earned its survived-in-space badge a few months ago. Spores of the species Physcomitrium patens lived nine months outside the ISS. Hunkering down in a dormant state helped the spores withstand being dried out and exposed to extreme temps. The spores were also enclosed in a natural casing called sporangium, which guarded them against space radiation.",
            "Scientists have likewise placed clumps of Deinococcus bacteria outside the space station. These microbes, which live in Earth\u2019s stratosphere, are known for standing up well to radiation. Some of them lived through a three-year stint in outer space.",
            "In another experiment, researchers left seeds from mustard and tobacco plants in space for more than a year and a half. Some of those seeds survived and sprouted plants. Tardigrades and lichens \u2014 both famous for withstanding harsh conditions on Earth \u2014 have done tours in space as well.",
            "These experiments are useful for a few reasons. They help scientists figure out which plants could be taken to the moon or Mars. Such hardy plants could supply astronauts with food and oxygen. Testing life\u2019s limits also reveals the risk of astronauts contaminating other planets with Earth microbes. And it offers clues about whether organisms could drift on space rocks from one planet to another. If so, life might be able to start in one place and spread across the universe \u2014 a concept known as panspermia.\u00a0",

            "Scientists spotted this aquatic architecture in the Weddell Sea. Those waters, off the coast of Antarctica, are some of the coldest on Earth. The discovery shows that fish there plan where they group their nests. This helps them protect their eggs from predators.",
            "Researchers described the neatly arranged nests October 29 in Frontiers in Marine Science. The new findings add evidence that the Weddell Sea is home to complex ecosystems worth preserving.",
            "Many countries want to use natural resources in the Antarctic, notes Thomas Desvignes. He\u2019s a fish biologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who did not take part in the new work. An international treaty currently protects Antarctica\u2019s resources. Still, some nations want to begin seabed mining or fishing in the Antarctic.",
            "Such actions would put local wildlife at risk. The new research, Desvignes says, offers \u201cone more reason why we should protect the Weddell Sea.\u201d",
            "In 2019, researchers set out to explore a patch of open water near a sheet of ice called the Larsen Ice Shelf. Those waters had recently been exposed after a huge chunk of ice broke off from the shelf. The team dropped an underwater robot into the ocean to survey and film the seafloor more than 350 meters (about 1,150 feet) below.",
            "After the journey, Russ Connelly looked through the videos hoping to find something interesting. A marine biologist, he works at the University of Essex in Colchester, England. The footage revealed bowl-shaped dimples pressed into the soft seafloor. \u00a0As he looked closer, Connelly noticed those imprints formed perfect ovals and curves.",

Or that it was pockmarks from stones dropping from the ice and making craters.\u201d",
            "But the marks seemed just too evenly spread out to be either of those.",
            "The team then used its knowledge of creatures living nearby to figure out the true imprint artists. Those odd divots, they realized, must be fish nests made by yellowfin rockcod.",
            "The videos turned up more than 1,000 yellowfin rockcod nests. They were arranged in five repeating patterns: clusters, crescents, U-shapes, lines and ovals. A few nests stood alone.",
            "Most nests grouped into clusters, with several nests bunched closely.\u00a0Connelly suspects this layout offers smaller fish better protection against predators. Larger fish that fend for themselves might live in those bigger, solo nests.",
            "Other reasons may explain the nests\u2019 odd ordering, too, Connelly says. It\u2019s possible that many fish couples grouped their nests together for protection. But a single pair might have made the clustered ones. These fish might be building extra nests as decoys. More trips to the region are needed to confirm how many fish are using the nests, Connelly says.",
            "These are hardly the only fish nests to have grabbed attention recently in the Weddell Sea. Almost four years ago, researchers discovered its Antarctic seafloor was home to the world\u2019s largest known colony of breeding fish. This one community of icefish was nesting across a 92-square-mile area of the seabed.",
            "\u201cIn general, we need to explore more of the oceans, because \u2026 we\u2019re so surprised at every single time that we see life exists at these depths,\u201d Connelly says. \u201cWe need to see what\u2019s out there before species that we didn\u2019t even know existed have been lost.\u201d"

They trained this form of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify which aspects of the survey data seemed to have the strongest link to eye health.

            "This slow fade sets tenebrescence apart from fluorescence. That\u2019s another light-related mineral property. Fluorescent minerals also color shift. But the effect ends when the light exposure does.",
            "Hackmanite shows tenebrescence. This milky white or light pink mineral is often mined in Greenland or Afghanistan. Exposure to UV light typically turns this mineral vivid purple or pink. Sulfur particles play a role in this effect. However, the color and light response can differ slightly from one hackmanite sample to another. That\u2019s because different rocks have slightly different chemical makeups. Other examples of minerals with this property include tugtupite and certain zircon minerals.",
            "Here\u2019s how it works. First, light energizes electrons in these minerals. That means the electrons absorb some of the energy from light. Then, the electrons re-emit this energy as light. That\u2019s where the new color comes from. Importantly, the electrons do not lose their energy immediately. As electrons slowly return to their resting state, the stone retains its new color.",
            "Fluorescent minerals work in a similar way. But there\u2019s a difference. These minerals re-emit their energy almost immediately. That\u2019s why the effect ends when the lights go out.",
            "Tenebrescence can be recreated in the lab. In the 1960s, it inspired scientists to develop sunglass lenses that darken in sunlight.",

            "It\u2019s not impossible for an asteroid to strike Earth during a person\u2019s lifetime. In fact, it\u2019s more likely than getting struck by lightning.",
            "Our solar system is peppered with large rocks, called asteroids. If a big asteroid plummets to Earth, there are many possible outcomes. The space rock could splash into the ocean and not harm anyone, for instance. Or it could wipe out a city. People have a hard time understanding the chances of an asteroid strike. So a team calculated the likelihood and compared it with other events \u2014 with some surprising results.",
            "\u201cIf a large or a medium asteroid were to hit the Earth, it would be something that almost everybody on the planet would be aware of,\u201d says Carrie Nugent. She\u2019s a planetary scientist at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass. While killer asteroids have hit before, such as the one that finished off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, Nugent says not to worry. \u201cWe try to put this event, which is actually a preventable event, in context with other preventable events.\u201d",
            "Nugent worked with six undergraduate students from Aalborg University in Denmark. Using a computer program, they simulated a group of asteroids similar to real near-Earth objects. They fed these modeled asteroids into a program called JPL Horizons. Anyone can use that program to look up predicted locations for objects in the solar system. For this project, the students determined whether each simulated asteroid would cross paths with Earth.",
            "That allowed the team to estimate the frequency of asteroids bigger than 140 meters (460 feet) across. That\u2019s around the size of a small cruise ship, Nugent says. An asteroid of this size would hit Earth roughly every 11,000 years. The researchers shared their findings August 12 in the Planetary Science Journal.",
            "That number is still pretty hard to understand. So Nugent compared the chances of an asteroid hitting Earth with other events that people may experience. The chances of being alive during an asteroid strike, she found, are higher than that of being struck by lightning. But a person is more likely to die in a car crash.",
            "Some events were rare but deadly. People \u2014 kids in particular \u2014 can die in dry sand hole collapses. This can happen when someone digs a large hole in sand, often at the beach. That hole can fall in on itself and take its digger down with it. \u201cIt is an extremely rare cause of death that most people don\u2019t even know about,\u201d Nugent says.",
            "Books and movies often portray asteroid run-ins as unstoppable events. \u201cThe truth is actually entirely the opposite,\u201d she says. NASA\u2019s DART Mission in 2022, for instance, bopped an asteroid that wasn\u2019t in danger of hitting Earth. The test changed the asteroid\u2019s path. This showed that people might be able to do this one day with a rock headed for our planet and avert a collision. So, Nugent says, it\u2019s important to do research, such as sky surveys, that locate these objects. \u201cThis is the one natural disaster we can totally prevent,\u201d she says.",
            "Nugent\u2019s team calculated the chances of near-Earth object (NEO), such as asteroids, hitting Earth in a person\u2019s lifetime. They compared this with the likelihood of other preventable events. The chance of an asteroid hitting the Earth is shown by the blue marker. The chance of such an asteroid killing a person is shown by the vertical blue bar.",
            "The graph is presented on a logarithmic scale. That means each grid line differs by a factor of ten from the one next to it. The x-axis gives the one-in-X chance that an event happens to an individual or the planet. For instance, the chance of being hit by lightning is 1-in-11,000. The y-axis gives the one-in-Y chance that a person dies if the event happens. So someone hit by lightning has a 1-in-10 chance of dying.",
            "Unlike most graphs, the label numbers on the x-axis get smaller moving to the right. And on the y-axis, they get smaller going up. This is because a one-in-X number is like a fraction with \u201c1\u201d on top and the \u201cX\u201d number on the bottom. The bigger the label number on these axes, the smaller the likelihood of that event happening.",

            "It\u2019s the first time that AI has created an entire genome, says Brian Hie. And even though scientists debate whether viruses are alive or not, the work is a step toward using AI to design living things.",
            "Hie is a computational biologist at Stanford University in California. He\u2019s part of a team that shared its new findings September 17 on bioRxiv.org. (Studies posted to that site have not yet been vetted by other scientists.)",
            "In the past, AI models have been used to design individual genes and proteins. Creating an entire genome from scratch, however, adds a new layer of complexity. It requires many genes and proteins to team up.",
            "To try to create genomes for bacteria-killing viruses, Hie\u2019s team turned to two of its own AI models. These models had trained on billions of pairs of DNA\u2019s basic units \u2014 abbreviated A, C, G and T \u2014 from existing phage genomes. (This is similar to the way\u00a0ChatGPT has trained on the billions of letters in books and internet posts.)",

Scientists first read out the complete set of genetic instructions for \u03a6X174 in 1977. Its DNA is now very well known and studied. This meant the scientists could easily compare how phage genomes designed by AI differed from that of \u03a6X174, Hie explains.",
            "One reason his team decided to test their genome-designing AI on phages: They don\u2019t infect people. That means it was safe to work with them in the lab. The researchers also did not train their models on viruses known to cause disease. In this way, they made sure their AI wouldn\u2019t design viruses that might harm people.",
            "The two AI models came up with roughly 300 potential phage genomes. Of those, 16 produced viruses that could infect\u00a0E. coli. Some of them even killed\u00a0E. coli\u00a0faster than \u03a6X174 did.",
            "What\u2019s more, \u03a6X174 failed to kill three strains of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0on its own. But mixtures of AI-generated phages quickly evolved to take out even those bacteria.\u00a0",
            "The new findings suggest AI could help develop new\u00a0viruses for use in medicine. Indeed, such phages might offer a way to treat bacterial infections that no longer respond to antibiotics.",
            "\u201cThe need to find a phage that targets [such a \u2018superbug\u2019] strain would be very urgent,\u201d says Kimberly Davis. \u201cAI could be a powerful way of rapidly generating a phage match to treat patients.\u201d Davis is a microbiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md.

            "Ideally, AI-made phages would not just kill one harmful type of bacteria, Hie says. They might also evolve to keep up with virus-resistant bacteria. Using AI to design entire organisms also could make microbes that speed up antibiotic production, Hie notes. Or they might allow the design of microbes to break down plastics.\u00a0",

Now researchers in Germany offer a new explanation. They show ice can melt slightly with no heat added. It\u2019s due to molecular-level changes that disrupt the crystal structure of ice.\u00a0",
            "For hundreds of years, people have tried to understand why ice is slippery. In the 1850s, Michael Faraday performed a now-famous experiment. This chemist and physicist showed that if you placed two ice cubes atop one another, eventually they\u2019d lock together. Each had been coated in a thin layer of water, he explained. And that water froze when the cubes touched.",
            "This didn\u2019t show, however, why ice was covered in that thin layer of water.",
            "A few years later, an engineer named James Thomson offered an explanation. Pressure, like heat, can melt ice. Using math, he showed that the pressure from a boot, say, or skate blade could melt a small amount of the ice. That could form the thin layer of water.",
            "But there was a problem with this explanation.",
            "The pressure from a boot wouldn\u2019t melt enough water for the ice to turn slippery. You\u2019d need to concentrate all of someone\u2019s weight on a very small area to do that. How small? About the size of a poppy seed.",
            "Almost a century later, in 1939, a pair of physical chemists came up with another idea. Pressure and heat together could melt ice to create a slippery layer of water, they suggested. This heat could develop from the friction of a boot or other object\u00a0traveling over the ice.",
            "But even this explanation fell short. Why? Ice remains slippery even at sub-freezing temps. And so the slick mystery persisted.",
            "In 2024, researchers at Peking University in Beijing, China, explained why some of the water layer forms. Tiny defects in the surface of ice, they found, can create a thin layer of water on top of it. In fact, notes Martin M\u00fcser, that team showed that \u201ceven at an extremely cold temperature, there is some initial water on the surface.\u201d However, M\u00fcser argues, that water layer is not thick enough to make ice truly slippery.",

That \u201cis why [this new model\u2019s] results should be taken seriously.\u201d A mechanical engineer, Carpick works at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.",
            "Pastewka\u2019s group has shown similar crystal defects in silicon and diamond. This can turn their surfaces slippery, too. Diamond has one critical difference, though. With water ice, \u201cthe harder you push, the easier it gets to turn it into a liquid-like goo,\u201d Pastewka says. In diamond, you get the opposite effect \u2014 which actually protects the surface.",
            "In theory, you could skate on diamond for the same reason you can on water ice. But you wouldn\u2019t leave as many marks on the surface of a diamond rink.",
            "So what\u2019s the solution to keep you from slipping on ice in winter? \u201cI would say, put on cleats,\u201d says M\u00fcser. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only way.\u201d",

            "A polar bear in Norway picks at its prey. Gulls nearby and other animals will eat the leftovers. Polar bears typically leave about 30 percent of edible animal\u2019s remains.",
            "Polar bears are picky eaters. And that\u2019s great news for other hungry Arctic critters.",
            "In one year, a polar bear can leave roughly 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of scraps behind on which other animals can dine. Altogether, that comes to an estimated 7.6 million kilograms (8,375 U.S. tons) of bear leftovers, researchers now estimate.",
            "This leftover meat, called carrion, points to the crucial role these bears \u2014 top predators \u2014 play in feeding other species.",
            "The research also sounds a warning. As climate change warms the Arctic, polar bears are at risk. A decline in their numbers could greatly threaten other species that are part of the Arctic food web.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Polar bears eat mainly seals, especially ringed seals. Scientists have long known these bears mostly eat the blubber of their prey. These diners often leave much of the rest behind. Until now, scientists have overlooked the size of those leftovers and their importance, says Nicholas Pilfold, A large-carnivore biologist, Pilfold works at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in California. He has done research in the Arctic for 15 years.",
            "As part of a team, Pilfold pored over studies, observations and anecdotes about scavenging activity around carcasses. These data went back as far as the 1930s. The researchers also analyzed studies on how many calories seals can provide. Then they also looked at studies that had tallied how many seals a polar bear consumes each year.",
            "During its hunting season peak, they found, a bear kills roughly one seal every three to five days. That comes to some 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of prey each year. A bear eats about 70 percent of that mass. The remaining 30 percent is up for grabs.",
            "Today\u2019s Arctic hosts an estimated 26,000 polar bears. So all those leftovers add up to millions of kilograms \u2014 thousands of tons \u2014 of food for scavengers.",

            "Those who benefit from the leftovers include Arctic foxes, gulls, ravens and other polar bears. Occasionally even snowy owls, wolves and grizzly bears will feast on the remains.",
            "Pilfold has seen that \u201cfoxes will follow in the tracks of where the polar bears have gone,\u201d waiting for the bears to abandon their meal. Birds also fly overhead, waiting their turn, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s just this cacophony of sound of gulls,\u201d he notes. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to get some of that seal.\u201d",
            "Other species couldn\u2019t access this type of food if the polar bears hadn\u2019t left it behind, says study coauthor Holly Gamblin. She is a wildlife biologist in Canada at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.",
            "The new findings don\u2019t surprise Jon Aars. A polar bear expert, he works at the Norwegian Polar Institute in Troms\u00f8. Bear leftovers are probably a \u201crather important\u201d food source for other species, he says \u2014 \u201cparticularly at a time of the year when alternative food is not so easy to get.\u201d",
            "Polar bears often swim to find seals at sea or on ice floes. As the Arctic has been warming, the ice has been melting, too. This gives bears fewer rest stops to catch their meals, dine and rest. Earlier work by Pilfold\u2019s team showed that the bears often have to swim exhaustingly long distances between meals. They tracked one female who swam 400 kilometers (249 miles) nonstop over a period of nine days.",
            "Such long treks are weakening bears and have led some to starve. This can reduce polar bear populations. If this happens, the carrion they provide will likely decrease as well, Pilfold now says.",
            "His team looked at two regions where polar bears have been declining. Here, they calculate, about 323,000 kilograms (710,000 pounds) of carrion are likely being lost each year. Melting ice might also make it harder for some scavengers to reach bear leftovers.",
            "It\u2019s hard to predict how reduced leftovers might affect other species, Aars says. But \u201cit will have [an] impact one way or another.\u201d And how big an impact, he says, will depend on the species and which \u201cpart of the Arctic we look at.\u201d"

            "Fictional heroes require magic or superpowers to lift objects without touching them. In the real world, you need physics. Sound, magnets and electricity, it turns out, can all create upward forces strong enough to cancel out the downward pull of gravity.",
            "This ability to suspend objects in midair could transform lab experiments, transportation and more. Just don\u2019t expect any real levitation technique to toss boulders or bad guys through the sky. At least, not without some outrageous \u2014 and dangerous \u2014 upgrades.",

            "If you\u2019ve ever been to a concert where the music was so loud you felt it thumping in your chest, then you know firsthand how strong sound waves can be. Acoustic levitation devices use those vibrations to hold objects aloft.",
            "\u201cYou can think of it as a very complicated surround-sound system,\u201d says Luke Cox. An acoustic levitator may contain hundreds of little speakers. Those speakers typically blare noise at a frequency of 40 kilohertz. Humans can\u2019t hear these sounds. \u201cBut if you look at the sound-pressure levels, it\u2019s louder than a jet engine,\u201d notes Cox. A mechanical engineer, he leads the company Impulsonics in Bristol, England.",
            "Sound waves from an acoustic levitator create alternating spots in the air of high- and low-intensity noise. The force of sound pushes objects away from the loud areas. As a result, items placed in quiet areas will stay there, as if tucked into invisible pockets. Fine-tuning the noise blasted by each speaker can steer those pockets around.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/S8IiUkJslbU?feature=oembed",
            "This acoustic levitator uses sound waves to steer millimeter-sized objects through the air. It can juggle up to 25 objects at once. The device is shown in a computer simulation on the right. It uses two grids of ultrasonic speakers (rainbow-colored dots at top and bottom) to create a field of sound waves (reddish pattern in the middle). In this sound field, particles get trapped in fairly quiet regions (black) between very loud regions (white).",
            "Acoustic levitation can lift all types of materials, solid or liquid. But it can only support very small, lightweight things. Some of the heaviest stuff to ever surf sound waves were Styrofoam puffs (like those inside beanbag chairs).",
            "Taller and wider objects need longer, lower-frequency sound waves to cradle them. Say you wanted to levitate a person \u2014 even someone curled into a ball. Cox estimates that would take at least 275-hertz waves, which are 1.25 meters (some 4 feet) long. Bass guitars play notes about that low. But the music from a bass-guitar levitator would also have to be devastatingly loud to lift someone off their feet.\u00a0",
            "\u201cI\u2019m probably going to need quite a few power plants\u201d to run the device, Cox muses. \u201cBut maybe a big nuclear one could do it.\u201d",
            "On top of that, you\u2019d need to shield anyone you levitated from the heat generated by that amount of power. Otherwise, your gnarly, nuclear-powered bass solo might literally melt their face off.",
            "Magnets, meanwhile, already safely lift objects much bigger than people off the ground.",
            "Perhaps the most striking display of that brute strength is a maglev train. Magnets on its cars and tracks interact to create an upward force. It lets the train hover about 10 centimeters (4 inches) above the track. This allows the train to glide nearly friction-free and travel twice as fast as trains that roll on rails. \u00a0",
            "Magnetic levitation is not limited to magnetic metals, notes Eric Severson. He\u2019s a mechanical engineer at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. Diamagnetic materials also can accomplish this feat. Around a strong magnet, these materials can become weakly magnetized and start to repel the magnet. This repulsive force, though feeble, can win a fight against gravity.",

The field created by the device was 16 teslas. That\u2019s about 10 times as strong as the magnets used to pick up cars in junkyards. And it was just enough to buoy the frog near the top of the inner coil of wire. That coil was 18 centimeters (7 inches) tall.",
            "\u201cYou could theoretically make a person float,\u201d Severson says. But you\u2019d need one heck of a magnet.\u00a0In 1998, one of the frog floaters estimated that\u00a0you\u2019d need a 40-tesla\u00a0field created by a magnet running on 1 gigawatt of power.\u00a0That\u2019s roughly\u00a0half the power produced by the Hoover Dam.\u00a0",
            "There\u2019s another catch with magnetism: its short range. You have to be close to a magnet to feel its effects. So making something soar through the sky would likely require some other tech.",

            "Khorisantono tested the algorithms\u2019 ability to guess what people had smelled based on the brain images alone. One of the best algorithms had been trained on images from a brain region called the insula.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Scientists once thought the insula responded only to tastes, Khorisantono says. But by 2017, work with rodents showed the insula could also process smells. Last year, scientists found that some insula cells respond to combinations of smells and tastes. That hinted that it may play a role in identifying flavor.",
            "The new study backs that up: that the insula is key to both smell and flavor.",
            "When participants in the new study got either the retronasal aroma of a specific flavor, or its taste, scans of the insula looked about the same. So the insula likely interpreted these smell and taste signals similarly.",
            "Algorithms trained on other regions also did well. And that may be because they receive flavor signals from the insula, Khorisantono explains.",
            "His team shared its new findings September 12 in Nature Communications",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The insula monitors organs such as the stomach and intestines. And it subtly influences our eating habits and how we feel about our bodies. But sitting deep in the brain, the insula is hard to study.",
            "In the past, it wasn\u2019t possible to dig into what it does in people because the advanced methods used in this study weren\u2019t available, says Ivan de Araujo. But methods such as machine learning are changing that. De Araujo, who did not take part in the new study, is a neuroscientist. He works at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T\u00fcbingen, Germany.",
            "The new findings could help explain why people crave certain foods and may be repulsed by others, de Araujo says. The new study tested only smells picked up by receptors in the back of the nose. But smells that trigger food cravings when we pass a bakery or restaurant stick to receptors in the front of our noses. He is now testing whether these smells also fire up the insula."

But one fateful Christmas Eve, his much-mocked nose makes Rudolph a hero. Using it as a beacon, Rudolph guides Santa\u2019s flying sleigh through a foggy night to deliver gifts around the world.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Rudolph\u2019s super-bright snout might seem as fantastical as his ability to fly. But a light-up body part needs no holiday magic. Many animals radiate a whole rainbow of colors through bioluminescence.\u00a0",
            "Given what we know about real animals that glow, a reindeer sporting a luminous nose would be unusual. Still, having a built-in red headlight would make a great adaptive trait for sleigh-pulling reindeer. Rudolph\u2019s red nose just might look a little different to someone on the ground.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Most bioluminescent animals use the same simple chemical reaction to light up cells in their bodies. It takes only two main ingredients. The first is a compound called a luciferin. The other is an enzyme called a luciferase. \u201cWhen oxygen is present in the cell, they react together and they give off light,\u201d says Danielle DeLeo. This marine biologist studies bioluminescence at Florida International University in Miami.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Mixing and matching different luciferins and luciferases creates different colors. Bioluminescent reactions light up the eerie bluish-green lanterns that dangle from anglerfish.

            "A lot of bioluminescence is near the blue end of the color spectrum. But some animals \u2014 such as fireflies, \u201crailroad worm\u201d beetles and some dragonfish \u2014 can glow red. Much like Rudolph, red-lit critters often do it to navigate dark and murky places.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Some deep-sea fish glow red, DeLeo says. Red light can\u2019t travel far through seawater. But in the pitch black of the deep sea, \u201cyou can use that light to kind of see short distances,\u201d she says. \u201cAnimals that might be a little bit further away from you aren\u2019t going to pick up on that red light and then attack you.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In foggy air, on the other hand, red light cuts through the gloom. Red has the longest wavelengths of any color we can see. With those longer wavelengths, it\u2019s less likely to be scattered by water droplets in foggy air, says Nathaniel Dominy. \u201cBlue light, green light, yellow light will scatter. Red light will travel far.\u201d Dominy is an evolutionary biologist who studies mammal color vision. He works at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.\u00a0",
            "If a sleigh-pulling reindeer were going to have a glowing nose, red would be the best color for it, says Dominy. \u201cFor Rudolph, that red light is going to allow them to navigate under foggy conditions more effectively than any other light.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The odds of this trait evolving in reindeer, though, is \u201cvery, very low,\u201d DeLeo says. Most bioluminescent animals are found in the ocean. And among the land animals that do glow, none are mammals. Still, it\u2019s not impossible for bioluminescence to emerge in a new species. \u201cIt\u2019s evolved at least 100 times across the tree of life,\u201d DeLeo notes.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "To someone on the ground who spied Rudolph flying, his nose might not look red at all. The reason is that when a light source is moving toward you, its light waves get squished and look bluer. When it\u2019s moving away, its light waves get stretched out and appear redder.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe don\u2019t see that typically around us, because things have to travel really fast for the redshift or the blueshift,\u201d says Laura Driessen. She\u2019s a radio astronomer at the University of Sydney in Australia. Santa\u2019s sleigh could be an exception. Driessen estimates that to visit every house in the world with kids who celebrate Christmas, Santa would have to tear through the sky at 8.2 million kilometers per hour (5 million miles per hour). That\u2019s nearly 1 percent the speed of light.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Santa might have to move even faster to have enough time to sneak down chimneys, arrange gifts under trees and maybe enjoy some milk and cookies, Driessen says. Say Santa travels at 10 percent the speed of light. As Rudolph approaches a house, his nose would be blueshifted to look orange. As he flies away, his nose would redshift to nearly the deepest crimson human eyes can see \u2014 so dark it would look almost black.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Rudolph\u2019s nose wouldn\u2019t be the only thing blueshifted and redshifted, either. Blueshifted brown hues, for instance, would take on a greenish tinge. \u201cWe\u2019d see a green sleigh and reindeer coming towards us. Then, for the brief moment that [Santa] has stopped and chucked the presents down our chimney, everything would look the normal color,\u201d Driessen says. As they moved away, Santa and his reindeer would almost disappear as they went into infrared.\u00a0",
            "Such fast movement and a brightly glowing nose would cost Rudolph a lot of energy, Dominy notes. \u201cI would want to make sure that he could get as much energy as possible. Sugary foods.\u201d So anyone leaving out treats for Santa this Christmas Eve should be sure to leave out plenty of cookies for his reindeer, too.\u00a0\u00a0"

Similarly, if you live in a cold climate, you may have seen the trucks that salt and sand the streets after a snowfall to prevent ice from building up on the roads. In both of these instances, salt is acting to lower the\u00a0freezing point\u00a0of water and changing what\u00a0phase of matter\u00a0the water is (i.e., turning solid ice into liquid water).",

This makes it possible to freeze the ice cream mixture in the inner container of the ice cream machine. For the salt spread on streets in wintertime, the lowered freezing point means that snow and ice can melt even when the weather is below the normal freezing point of water.

A\u00a0molecule\u00a0of the solute dissolves (goes into solution) because the force of attraction between the solute molecule and the solvent molecules is greater than the force of attraction between the molecules of the solute. Water (H2O) is a good solvent because it is partially\u00a0polarized. (This polarization is caused by the distribution of\u00a0electrons\u00a0in the water molecule. Specifically, its hydrogen ends have a partial\u00a0positive charge, and the oxygen end has a partial\u00a0negative charge.)",

            "In the 1980s, botanists first found signs that plants communicate with each other. In one early experiment, hurt trees seemed to warn their neighbors of danger.",

            "fCPlants can communicate with one another, through underground fungal networks and through the air.",
            "Back then, Jack Schultz and Ian Baldwin were young researchers at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. They potted up tree seedlings and sealed them inside a clear plastic container. Each had its own pot, and the trees didn\u2019t touch each other.",
            "When the researchers tore leaves on one tree, it responded by producing a chemical to repel attackers. Then, about 36 hours later, the undamaged trees made the same chemical. The hurt tree must have sent a signal through the air to the others, the team concluded.",
            "Some people described this as plants \u201ctalking\u201d to each other. The finding, reported in 1983, launched the science of plant communication.",
            "Since then, scientists have shown this communication can be fairly complex.",
            "Plants respond better to messages from close kin than to ones from unrelated plants. It\u2019s something Rick Karban has shown. At the University of California, Davis, he studies how plants and insects interact. Work by his group and others shows plants can tell one predator from another. They send different signals depending on what type of insect is attacking.",
            "Their messages can even signal how far away danger is, a team in Finland now reports. It shared that finding September 12 in Science.",

            "In 2023, a team in Tel Aviv, Israel, recorded clicks and pops made by plants under stress. The sounds varied across plant species and type of stress, such as drought and being cut. Although roughly as loud as human speech, they\u2019re too high-pitched for people to hear. Other animals, however, such as bats, mice and insects, might be able to hear them, the researchers note.",

            "Other work suggests that plants can learn and even remember. One famous study in 2014 used a plant called Mimosa pudica. Known for being \u201csensitive,\u201d it curls its leaves when it\u2019s disturbed.",
            "The researchers potted up dozens of these plants. Then they dropped each Mimosa 60 times in a row. The plants weren\u2019t harmed by the drop. It was short, with a soft landing. And they curled their leaves \u2014 but only the first few times. Pretty quickly, they stopped reacting.",
            "Just to be sure the plants weren\u2019t too tired to fold their leaves, the researchers shook the plants. Now they curled their leaves right away. But when dropped again, they didn\u2019t curl them. The plants had learned that the drop wasn\u2019t going to hurt them, the researchers concluded.",
            "A month later, they tried the experiment again. The plants still didn\u2019t curl their leaves after being dropped. It was as though they remembered it wouldn\u2019t hurt them. They had formed long-lasting memories.",
            "It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that plants can do all these things, Gilroy says.",
            "\u201cEverything that\u2019s alive has to solve the same problems,\u201d he notes. \u201cPlants have to feed themselves. Plants have to get water. Plants have to defend themselves.\u201d",

They deter bugs by making bitter compounds. They send roots toward water and nutrients. They even release chemicals that change the soil to make it better for the plant, says Gilroy.",

            "How do plants remember and send messages without a nervous system? The researchers who dropped the mimosa plants had an idea about that. They suggested that there may be other ways to remember.",
            "Neurons, or nerve cells, send messages via chemicals called neurotransmitters. Even though plants don\u2019t have a nervous system, they have many of the same neurotransmitters that animals have.",
            "One of those is glutamate. Wounded leaves use glutamate to send messages. These signals tell undamaged leaves to boost their defenses against possible threats, notes Edward Farmer. A plant biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, he and his team published this finding back in 2013.",
            "Since then, other teams have learned more about how this messaging works. And it\u2019s very similar to how neural signaling works in animals \u2014 but maybe better, Gilroy and his team show.",

            "This can happen several different ways. For example, it may happen when two rivers cross paths. The more powerful river can cut into the channel of a weaker one. Water flows down the path of least resistance. So, the stronger river may begin diverting water away from the weaker one. This kind of river piracy is called point capture. There is a specific point where the two river channels meet.",
            "Even when river channels do not connect, a stronger river can still take water from a weaker one. One river may shift into the region that provides water to another river. This region is called a drainage basin. If one river moves into another\u2019s drainage basin, water may begin draining into the new river.",
            "River piracy can be a slow and gradual process. But sometimes, it happens fast. Climate change can rapidly alter a river\u2019s course.",
            "In 2016, glacial melt allowed one river to drain another in a matter of months. This happened in northwestern Canada in the Yukon territory. A glacier once separated two nearby rivers. These were the Slims River and the Kaskawulsh River. But as temperatures have risen with climate change, this glacier has melted and shrunk. The meltwater carved a new stream channel. This new channel diverted water away from the Slims River. It flowed instead into the Kaskawulsh River. This left the Slims River abandoned and changed the ecosystem downstream.",

For example, a 2024 solar storm created two extra belts between the main ones. These belts lasted over 4 months. But temporary belts usually last only a few weeks.",
            "The Van Allen belts consist of protons, electrons and other high-energy particles. These particles come from solar wind and cosmic rays. Solar wind refers to streams of charged particles flowing out from the sun. Cosmic rays can come from other stars and galaxies. Earth\u2019s magnetic field protects us from these particles, deflecting them before they get to the surface and trapping them in the region between Earth\u2019s north and south poles. This creates the Van Allen belts.",
            "Changes in solar activity can cause the belts to swell or shrink. The inner belt typically exists about 6,000 to 12,000 kilometers (about 3,700 to 7,400 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface. But it can dip much closer. One such dip occurs over the Atlantic Ocean. Here, there is a weak spot in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Because of this weak spot, the inner belt dips to about 200 kilometers (about 120 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface. The outer belt extends about 12,000 to 64,000 kilometers (7,400 to 40,000 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface.",

To astrophysicist Naomi McClure-Griffiths, what might be most exciting about HVCs is that they\u2019ve inspired astronomers to think in new ways about how galaxies form and change. McClure-Griffiths works at Australian National University in Canberra. She\u2019s also the chief scientist for the SKA Observatory, a global network of radio telescopes.",

Other researchers wondered whether the clouds had once blasted out of our galaxy and were now falling back in. Some scientists have even proposed that the clouds were stuff that had been stripped away from smaller galaxies \u2014 ones that had long ago bumped up against the Milky Way.",
            "What is clear, Stanimirovi\u0107 says, is that HVCs can\u2019t be explained by a single source. They\u2019re more complicated than that.",

Radio \u201cnoise\u201d hinted that dense clumps of gas might be lurking outside the Milky Way. That gas might make a giant sphere surrounding the galaxy\u2019s disk.",

            "In September 1963, that search turned up a cloud unlike any seen inside the galaxy. It wasn\u2019t moving with the rotation of the Milky Way. Instead, it was barreling toward the disk at an estimated 175 kilometers per second (110 miles per second).",
            "This was the first HVC ever detected.",
            "Two more HVCs turned up the same year. All three were made of neutral hydrogen, with other elements sprinkled in. (Neutral simply means the hydrogen had no electric charge.) Seeing hydrogen wasn\u2019t surprising. It\u2019s the most common element in the universe. The other elements present could offer clues to where HVCs are born.",
            "One of those HVCs was Smith\u2019s Cloud. It was named for its discoverer, astronomer Gail Smith. At the time, she was a graduate student at Leiden University, in the Netherlands. Smith\u2019s Cloud is now the most-studied and best-known HVC.",
            "Since then, astronomers have observed more HVCs scattered across the heavens. They can be found all over the sky. They\u2019ve also inspired many, many questions, such as: \u201cAre these intruders? Are they coming from some other galaxies?\u201d Stanimirovi\u0107 asks. Or are they objects that once lived in the Milky Way disk and, at some point, got expelled?",
            "That last idea was one of the first ones proposed.",
            "Dutch astronomer Jan Oort helped find and study the first HVC. He would go on to hypothesize in the 1960s that HVCs formed from gas left over from when the Milky Way formed. That would have been billions of years ago.",
            "Others have since suggested that ancient high-energy events blasted vast clumps of gas out of our galaxy. Maybe a bunch of stars, for instance, \u201cwent supernova at about the similar time,\u201d says Stanimirovi\u0107.",
            "That huge burst of energy would have blown gases outward. Once those dying stars ran out of fuel, the exiting gas plume would slow and cool, condensing into clouds. Over time, they could change shape and direction. Eventually, our galaxy\u2019s gravity would begin to tug them back toward its disk. (Imagine a volcano blasting lava into the sky. As that molten lava cooled in the air, it would solidify into rocks that fell back to Earth.)",
            "You might think of these as \u201cgalactic fountains,\u201d Stanimirovi\u0107 says. Maybe the Milky Way produced many HVCs this way. As those speed demons fell back toward the galaxy, they could serve as new star-making material.",

            "If this idea is true, HVCs should contain metallic dust, says Lehner. That\u2019s because galactic fountains are driven by stars, and stars are where metals are born. Any gas they shoot out, therefore, should also contain metals.",
            "Such dust would be \u201can ingredient that tells you the HVC is probably coming from the Milky Way disk, instead of [from] outside,\u201d he says. \u201cThe dust has to come from somewhere.\u201d",
            "For decades, Lehner says, studies of HVCs turned up no dust. But by the end of the 20th century, better radio telescopes started to spy it.",
            "In the last decade, astronomers have found metals in Smith\u2019s Cloud, for instance. Some of those measurements came from the Hubble Space Telescope. Smith\u2019s metal content suggests it might have formed from a galactic fountain, blown out of the Milky Way millions of years ago.",
            "But the details aren\u2019t clear. So the debate isn\u2019t settled.",
            "Scientists still can\u2019t explain the incredible size and speed of Smith\u2019s Cloud. It contains as much mass as a few million suns. That means it would have taken an enormous amount of energy to produce \u2014 more than scientists can explain from a galactic fountain.",
            "Some astronomers have argued instead that this HVC may be the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that passed too close to the Milky Way.",
            "Smaller HVCs, says Stanimirovi\u0107, are easier to explain as galactic fountains. The big ones may be something else, she says \u2014 like the sign of a smaller galaxy punching through our cosmic neighborhood.",

            "One 2019 project by Lehner and others, for instance, analyzed studies of HVCs to understand how they seem to have interacted with the Milky Way. Right now, it suggests, more gas seems to be flowing into the galaxy than out of it. But it spotted clouds moving in both directions \u2014 almost as though the galaxy is breathing.

Maybe magnetic fields prevent the force of gravity from ripping them apart. That could explain why the clouds hold their shape.",

            "A handheld 3-D printer might someday print bone grafts directly onto fractures. Researchers prototyped the idea with a modified glue gun. They included antibiotics in the material to ease healing.",
            "A repurposed glue gun has helped repair broken bones in rabbits. Instead of a regular glue stick, it melts a material that helps bones heal.",
            "Some breaks in bones need a little help to mend. So surgeons sometimes take a bit of bone from elsewhere in the body to make a patch called a graft. Or they can use a synthetic \u2014 human-made \u2014 material that mimics bone.",
            "Synthetic grafts are often 3-D printed. Usually, X-ray scans and measurements of injuries are needed to make sure the graft will fit just right. Designing and making the graft takes time and can delay repairs.",
            "But the glue gun method doesn\u2019t require images of the fracture. And it doesn\u2019t need any special graft design. The handheld device can simply squirt the graft material right onto a break. ",
            "The idea was to design a printing system that could be easily used in operating rooms, says Jung Seung Lee. He\u2019s a biomedical engineer at Sungkyunkwan University. That\u2019s in Seoul, South Korea. Compared with regular bone grafts, he says, this system can save time, cost and complex procedures.",
            "The printing device holds sticks of a specially made \u201cbioink.\u201d It\u2019s safe to use in the body. It consists of two compounds commonly used for 3-D printing implants. One, hydroxyapatite, is a mineral found in bones. The other is a body-safe plastic called polycaprolactone, or PCL. That\u2019s included to support new bone as it grows. In an implant, it \u201cgradually degrades in our body over months,\u201d Lee says. Over time, newly grown bone will fill in as the graft breaks down.",
            "The ratio of the two compounds in the bioink determines the material\u2019s strength and stiffness. So the researchers can tailor the mixture for each use. They also added antibiotics into the bioink to prevent infections.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Like the glue sticks used for crafting, the bioink fits in the handheld printer. It can be squeezed out where it\u2019s needed. But regular hot glue guns work at temperatures far too high for living tissues.",
            "So the researchers modified their glue gun to work at lower temperatures. They also adjusted the tip for better control. Thanks to the low melting point of PCL, the bioink can be applied at about 60\u00b0 Celsius (140\u00b0 Fahrenheit). It cools to body temperature within 40 seconds. The whole process takes just a few minutes.",
            "Lee\u2019s team tested the printer and bioink on broken leg bones in rabbits. Another set of rabbits got a material called bone cement, which is used to attach implants to bones. The rabbits that got the bioink had better healing and regrowth of bone tissue. And the animals showed no signs of infection during the 12 weeks after surgery. The team shared its results September 5 in Device.",
            "For now, the printer is still a proof-of-concept for people. Lee aims to develop it into a multi-use printing system. For instance, it might apply chemicals that promote healing during surgeries. But first, researchers will have to do more studies to make sure the technology is safe. They\u2019ll also need to figure out how to disinfect the device between uses.",
            "There may be other limitations. \u201cThe high temperature of the extruded material is likely to stress or kill the cells,\u201d says Deborah Mason. She\u2019s a molecular and cell biologist at Cardiff University in Wales. She wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Lee\u2019s team is working to modify the tip of the device. That could help the bioink cool more quickly after extrusion.",
            "In the future, this sort of device could help surgeons with more complex repairs, suggests Nieves Cubo-Mateo. She\u2019s a biomaterials engineer at Nebrija University in Madrid, Spain. She wasn\u2019t part of the study.",
            "But there is a long way to go for that to happen, she says. The printer would need to work with other tools that surgeons use. Those include imaging technologies and robotic devices used during surgeries. That would take the new device beyond just a \u201cdefect-filler,\u201d she says. Someday, it could be a \u201cbone printer pen\u201d useful for many types of surgeries.",

And this can happen even where you can\u2019t smell any car exhaust. Atmospheric chemists at Texas A&M University in College Station shared their new findings here, on August 18, at the American Chemical Society fall meeting.",
            "People expect to find air pollution in and around cities. There, vehicles cough pollutants out of their tailpipes.

            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

            "Learn why isoprene \u2014 a chemical released by trees (and lots of other plants) \u2014 can make air pollution worse. It\u2019s the second most widely emitted volatile organic chemical (after methane) in the world. The chemistry explained here underlies the data reported in the new study.",
            "Once all her equipment was ready, Aridjis-Olivos waited for the next heat wave.",
            "It hit in August 2024. From August 5 to September 3, she sampled different gases and particles from the air 24 hours a day.",
            "As the temps rose each day, so did levels of ozone, oxygenated volatile organic chemicals (some of which are toxic to human airways) and acid-rich nanoparticles. Ozone levels, in particular, climbed as the heat rose. Then they stayed high throughout the hottest part of the day. That in itself was no surprise. Trees ramp up isoprene release during heat waves. Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",
            "The surprise was just how high the ozone levels climbed. If you just looked at the levels of other pollutants, like the nitrogen oxides from cars, you might think the air was safe to breathe.",
            "And while a heat wave feels miserable, says Zhang, \u201cexposure to both extreme heat and high ozone can be very dangerous.\u201d",
            "This research shows how \u201cclimate change is making air pollution harder to control,\u201d says Russ Dickerson. An atmospheric chemist, he works at the University of Maryland in College Park. Air pollution is a leading cause of death, he notes. The World Health Organization reports that today 99 percent of people worldwide are exposed to air unhealthy enough to pose a risk to our lungs.",

            "If you can\u2019t avoid a heat wave, how can you protect yourself from air pollution that may come with it? Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible. Remember to check your local air quality index when making plans, Yarber says. \u201cKids are especially sensitive to air pollution,\u201d she notes, \u201cbecause their lungs are still growing.\u201d",

Then direct air through it with an electric fan. Remember to keep the windows closed.",
            "There are also ways to improve outdoor air quality. For instance, communities can work to limit becoming \u201cheat islands.\u201d Two obvious ways: Increase shaded area, and limit how much heat-absorbing concrete they have.",
            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change?

And it can be a truly impressive spectacle.",
            "Hail forms high in the clouds during a storm. There, some raindrops freeze solid. As more and more raindrops collide, an icy \u201cstone\u201d grows in size until it\u2019s too heavy to remain aloft.",

But such looping motions are actually rare, scientists in China have now shown. They analyzed hailstones collected by citizen scientists.",
            "Since 2016, people had been collecting hailstones across 15 provinces in China. These citizen scientists gathered more than 3,000 of these bits of ice and stored them until people on Qinghong Zhang\u2019s team could retrieve the hail.

The researchers then analyzed the specific isotopes of oxygen present in the frozen water within each layer. By matching that chemistry with the properties of the atmosphere at different heights, they could estimate the paths each ice ball had taken through the sky.",

            "The finding comes from a November 6 study in Journal of Experimental Biology.",
            "Woodpeckers are famous for hammering away at trees really fast and really hard. They strike wood hundreds of times per minute at forces 20 to 30 times their body weight.

Those devices picked up small electrical signals as the birds\u2019 muscles contracted, or shortened. Each bird wore a tiny backpack that recorded the electrode data. At the same time, a camera captured high-speed video of the birds\u2019 movements.",
            "The researchers watched the woodpeckers for a half hour at a time. They saw the birds drill, a behavior used to poke and dig. They also observed the birds tapping to communicate. After a few days, the scientists released the birds back into the wild.",
            "Woodpeckers drum too loud to hear anything but beaks on wood. But in this clip, the researchers turned data from the birds\u2019 respiratory system into sound. This allows us to \u201chear\u201d their breathing while pecking.",
            "A close look at the electrode and video data showed that woodpeckers\u2019 muscles and breathing work in harmony. This allows the birds\u2019 heads to move like hammers.",
            "When humans use a hammer, muscles in the back of their wrist stiffen. That cuts how much energy is lost when they hit something. The researchers saw a comparable stiffening in some of the woodpeckers\u2019 neck muscles. It\u2019s amazing, Antonson says, \u201cjust how similar it is to the way we hammer.\u201d",
            "Other muscles played special roles in the pecking motion. Before they struck, the birds seemed to steady themselves with their tail muscles. The power of the strike itself came from a single muscle in the hip.",
            "Distinct head and neck muscles helped pull back the head after each beat. These muscles activated before others completed their forward movement. The overlapping contractions may help smooth out the peckers\u2019 back-and-forth motions during a rapid drum solo.",
            "The team also looked at the woodpeckers\u2019 breathing to see if they exerted effort more like weightlifters or tennis players. Heavy weightlifters hold their breath when flexing. Tennis players, meanwhile, exhale through big movements.",
            "Downy woodpeckers, it turned out, take after tennis players. They can jab and exhale as many as 13 times per second. Between each blow, the birds take an inhale that lasts just 40 milliseconds. That\u2019s 10 times faster than some humans blink! The movement\u2019s timing stayed remarkably consistent over multiple taps, Antonson reports.",
            "Songbirds are known to take mini breaths while singing. Woodpeckers doing the same thing suggests their pecking, when done socially, might be more like singing than experts had thought, says Daniel Tobiansky. He wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. He studies bird brains and behavior at Providence College in Rhode Island.",
            "Nonvocal communication, such as pecking, often gets overlooked in animal research, Tobiansky says. Finding a similarity between bird drumming and singing might help scientists learn how these behaviors evolved."

            "They asked more than 100 people to observe sequences of images on a computer. Sometimes people saw animals (such as aardvarks, hamsters or sea stars). Other times they saw everyday tools. Participants initially just viewed these images \u2014 dozens of them. Next, they viewed similar images. This time, they\u2019d be rewarded for labeling them as animals or tools.",
            "About half the participants, for instance, might receive 900 points for identifying a hamster as an animal and 1 point for identifying a hammer as a tool. The other half received the opposite rewards: maybe 900 points for the hammer and 1 point for the hamster.",
            "The next day, the team gave their participants a pop quiz on images they\u2019d seen the day before. And, it turns out, both reward size and type of image sometimes affected what these people remembered.",
            "Receiving a big reward for identifying animals enhanced someone\u2019s memories of animals. Those who received a small reward remembered about 45 percent of the animals they\u2019d seen in the first round. Participants remembered more \u2014 about 50 percent \u2014 if they\u2019d received a large reward for labeling the animals earlier.",
            "This memory boost didn\u2019t work for tools, though. Big rewards didn\u2019t help people remember the tools they\u2019d seen earlier. Lin suspects that\u2019s because people formed strong memories of the tools from the beginning, so adding a reward didn\u2019t provide much more of a benefit.",
            "Rewards for animals also didn\u2019t help people remember which tools they\u2019d seen. It seems the brain links memories within a category, not across different categories.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Everyday memories are known to be temporary, says Joseph Dunsmoor. This cognitive neuroscientist works at the University of Texas at Austin where he has done similar research. This new study, he notes, is one of the first to show the brain is more likely to recall weak memories when they relate to some other, strong memory. \u201cThe thing that occurred in the past suddenly takes on more meaning,\u201d he concludes.",
            "Lin\u2019s team also showed that people were better at forming new memories after receiving a big reward. After a big event, the brain is alert. It\u2019s open to new information. So now, Lin says, new memories are more likely to stick around.",
            "Sorting out what\u2019s going on in the brain while memories form will take more time.",
            "In the meantime, therapists could use these findings to help people enhance the everyday memories that occurred before a trauma. This might dull the pain of what came after, Lin says. Teachers might also use the findings to help students retain more of what they learn. For instance, Lin suggests, if Susie surprisingly jumps up and down in a math word problem, perhaps the class should jump up and down, too."

They shared their results in the Oct. 2 Nature. The parachutes would also be simple to make and deploy, M\u00e9lan\u00e7on says. Traditional fabric parachutes require sewing and folding.",
            "As a simple test, the researchers attached a 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) water bottle to a kirigami parachute 0.5 meter (1.6 feet) across. They dropped it from a drone flying at a height of 60 meters (200 feet). The bottle reached a speed of about 14 meters per second (46 feet per second). A bottle without a parachute would\u2019ve topped out at about 34 meters per second (112 feet per second).",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Because they\u2019re full of holes, the new parachutes produce less drag than similarly sized fabric parachutes. That means they have to be bigger than a normal parachute. So they might not be practical for large things. Consider a person. To keep from crash-landing, a human might need a kirigami parachute a couple hundred meters (yards) across, M\u00e9lan\u00e7on suggests. That would be longer than two football fields!",
            "These new parachutes could help with smaller drops, though. For instance, they could be used to deliver packages by drones. Or they could be used for dropping food or other supplies from airplanes in hard-to-reach areas, he says.",
            "The team is also considering using materials like cardboard that can break down easily in the environment. And there may be other ways to tweak the parachutes\u2019 design. For example, the disks could be cut so that they fall with the whirling motion of winged maple seeds. That could come in handy on space missions to other planets. It would let an on-board camera take photos from all angles as it descends through an alien atmosphere."

            "Hyaluronic (HY-uh-lu-RON-ik) acid \u2014 a chemical that plumps up our skin \u2014 gives structural support to the microneedles. Those tiny needles then deliver antibacterial compounds right where they\u2019re needed. Inflammation-fighting chemicals also cool redness and swelling.",

            "The microneedles used in other drug-delivery patches tend to be cone-shaped. But that means they easily slip out of the skin. The Korean team gave their needles a bulb-shaped bottom. They call the design \u201cMicroLock.\u201d Like soft-edged-cylindrical barbs, they lock in place.",

In contrast, \u00c7elik notes, patches would deliver a drug to a broader area \u2014 \u201cnot a single point.\u201d He believes that will lead to a better immune response than a typical shot.",

But his team is working on ways that microneedles could deliver such drugs. One type would deliver medicines targeted at diabetes and obesity. His group described it in 2024 in Advanced Materials.",
            "Governments regulate what new medical products can be used in their countries. These rules ensure those products are safe. In the United States, for instance, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, writes those rules. Right now, no such rules exist for microneedle patches, \u00c7elik notes. That makes them a headache for companies to develop and bring to pharmacies. \u201cEveryone is waiting for\u201d those guidelines, he says.",

            "Locking microneedles might help open the door for patch delivery of other medications. Why? When it comes to prescription drugs, how much a patch dispenses really matters, explains \u00c7elik. The FDA would require a patch to deliver a set dose \u2014 not more, not less. Patches typically lack such consistency.",
            "For example, a patch may deliver 40 percent of the drug one time. The next, it might deliver only 8 percent, notes \u00c7elik. A microneedle patch for prescription medicines, he says, must deliver the same amount of drug \u201ceach and every time.\u201d",

Vitamin A is important for our lungs, skin and eyes.Vitamin D is a pro-hormone. The kidneys turn it into a fully active hormone. And it\u2019s quite versatile. This hormone plays a pivotal role in building strong bones and muscles and protecting the body from diseases, including some cancers. This vitamin also helps fight infections.",

And new ones are still being discovered. ",

And it\u2019s hard to reach the recommended amount of vitamin D through food alone. Vitamin D supplements may help those with heavily pigmented skin or whose skin doesn\u2019t get access to enough of the sun\u2019s UV rays.But these supplements should only be taken after talking with your doctor, says Mantzioris. One reason: Mixing vitamin supplements with certain medications can be risky. ",
            "Some vitamins, such as A, can be toxic when taken in high amounts. But poisoning is highly unlikely to happen when they\u2019re consumed as part of a balanced diet. Most people who consume too many vitamins do so by taking supplements.Taking too many supplements also risks flooding the body with more nutrients than it can handle. Fat-soluble vitamins can build up in our fat stores over time, leading to dangerous side effects. Even overdosing on some water-soluble vitamins can pose problems.Cases of poisoning from water-soluble vitamin B6, for instance, are on the rise in Australia, notes Mantzioris. In addition to supplements, this nutrient is often added to energy drinks, weight-loss shakes and certain food products. One symptom of too much B6 is nerve damage. It often starts as a tingling in the fingers and toes. \u201cIf it\u2019s not caught in time, it can cause permanent damage,\u201d Mantzioris says.Instead of splurging on supplements, Mantzioris recommends that people looking to stay healthy should focus on a food-first approach. \u201cPeople spend a lot of money on these [vitamin supplements] \u2014 and mostly without a lot of gain,\u201d says Mantzioris. \u201cI would rather spend the money on having really yummy food.\u201d",
