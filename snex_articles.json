            "Fossils of the rhino Teleoceras (shown) are among the most common ancient herbivores found at Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park in northern Nebraska. The animals died roughly 12 million years ago, suffocated by ash from an eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano.",
            "Millions of years ago in what\u2019s now the U.S. Midwest, watering holes and rivers were home to huge herds of stumpy-legged rhinos. While most rhinos today prefer a solo lifestyle, these ancient party animals formed big herds. They also stuck close to home.",
            "These new insights come from chemical clues in fossil teeth. Researchers shared the findings April 4 in Scientific Reports.",
            "An extinct corgi-shaped cousin of today\u2019s rhinos \u2014 Teleoceras \u2014 left the fossilized remains. They came from animals that died some 12 million years ago when a huge Yellowstone volcano erupted in what is now Idaho.",
            "That explosion blanketed much of North America in ash. And here, in what\u2019s now Nebraska, about 30 centimeters (1 foot) of ash fell over a watering hole used by Teleoceras and its neighbors.",
            "\u201cIt would have been like a bad dust storm,\u201d says Clark Ward. A paleontologist, he led the research. Ward works at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.\u00a0",
            "This ash slowly suffocated and starved hundreds of animals at the Nebraska watering hole. This ancient animal graveyard is now preserved as Ashfall Fossil Beds State Historical Park. Scientists have uncovered more than 100 Teleoceras skeletons here.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Fossils provide all types of clues about long-extinct animals. What they ate, for example. And how they behaved.",
            "Ward\u2019s team wanted to know two things. Did Teleoceras live both on land and in the water? (The species\u2019 round, hippo-like body suggested they did.) And was this species mostly solitary, like modern rhinos? Or were they more social, like today\u2019s hippos?",
            "For answers, the team looked into whether the rhinos that died at Ashfall lived there full-time or had just been caught during a brief visit. So the researchers sampled 13 rhino molars \u2014 a type of tooth. They looked at the relative amounts, or ratios, of different isotopes (forms of various elements) in their teeth.",
            "The carbon isotopes would point to what types of grasses the ancient animals ate. Ratios of oxygen isotopes should reflect seasonal changes in their diet. Together, these details could paint a picture of the animals\u2019 habitat. Strontium isotopes in a tooth, meanwhile, could be tied to specific areas.",
            "Measuring these isotope ratios allowed the researchers to see if ancient animals traveled between regions.",
            "The carbon and strontium ratios varied little, the team found. Those data suggest Teleoceras didn\u2019t wander far. It lounged in mud and fed on grasses right around Ashfall. With so many remains at Ashfall, the results also suggest these rhinos lived in huge herds.",
            "Ward was a bit surprised that the rhinos seemed such homebodies.",
            "\u201cI suspected young males to travel far distances in search of mates,\u201d he says. Mating only within their herds could have raised the chances of inbreeding. This can raise the risk of gene mutations building up in a population. The result could be weak or sickly offspring.",
            "To limit this risk, the rhinos may have mated with neighboring herds.",
            "The findings also shed light on the ancient Ashfall ecosystem, says Danielle Fraser. An evolutionary biologist, she did not take part in this study. She works at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. If the rhinos didn\u2019t have to migrate, she says, they likely had plenty of food and water year-round.But Ward and his team remain puzzled by one thing. How could so many rhinos, horses and camels live together in the same place? Wouldn\u2019t they eat all of the plants and run out of food?",
            "Perhaps Earth\u2019s warmer climate back then led to a bigger plant bounty. In fact, Ward says, maybe those plant-eating animals boosted plant growth. They might have had this effect as they munched on older vegetation \u2014 dropping fertilizing poop along the way.",

But in DC and Marvel superhero movies, a rough childhood doesn\u2019t always mean that characters become villains.",

Seeking out supportive adults is one way to get help during hard times.",

            "*An_image_of_the_constellation_Sagittarius_shows_a_star-dotted_expanse_of_space_There_is_a_lone_black",
            "The eight bright stars forming a teapot-like configuration (as seen in this photograph) are part of the constellation Sagittarius. Thousands of light-years beyond them lurks the first lone black hole ever detected. From mid-northern latitudes, Sagittarius appears in the southern sky during summer and early fall.",
            "For the first time, astronomers have confirmed the existence of a lone black hole. This rogue is wandering around the Milky Way \u2014 our galaxy \u2014 with no companion star.",
            "It\u2019s \u201cthe only [loner] so far,\u201d says Kailash Sahu. He\u2019s an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md.",
            "In 2022, Sahu was part of a team that found the dark object moving through the constellation Sagittarius. (This group of stars in the southern sky takes its name from the Latin for \u201carcher.\u201d)",
            "At the time, this discovery made headlines. The reason: Until then, all known black holes had a companion star. Those companions had pointed to the presence of the black holes (which can\u2019t be seen because they emit no light).",
            "A second team would go on to dispute the claim that this rogue was a black hole. They argued it could be a neutron star.",
            "But new observations by the Hubble Space Telescope now confirm the rogue object is about seven times as massive as the sun. That\u2019s so massive that the dark object is a black hole. Black holes are more than three times as massive as the sun. Neutron stars, though, have less mass than this. So the dark object must be a black hole, Sahu\u2019s group reasoned.",
            "The team shared that finding in the April 20 issue of The Astrophysical Journal.",
            "Solitary black holes should be common. But since they don\u2019t normally affect visible stars, they\u2019re hard to find. The lone black hole in Sagittarius revealed itself only because it passed in front of a dim background star.",
            "During that passage in July 2011, the black hole\u2019s intense gravity magnified the star\u2019s light through what\u2019s known as gravitational lensing. This lensing slowly shifted the star\u2019s apparent position, too.",
            "That star\u2019s position still hasn\u2019t settled down. This shows why \u201cit takes a long time to do the observations,\u201d Sahu says.",
            "The rogue\u2019s original discovery relied on Hubble\u2019s precise measurements of star positions from 2011 to 2017. The new study adds in Hubble data from 2021 and 2022. It also uses data collected by the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia spacecraft.",
            "What these data now show: The black hole is 7.1 times as massive as the sun (give or take 0.8 solar mass).",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "And that research team of doubters? They revised their assessment in 2023. They now agree the object is a black hole. That team estimates the object\u2019s mass may be only six times that of the sun. But because this team is not as certain of the black hole\u2019s mass as Sahu\u2019s group, the two results are considered consistent.",
            "Located 5,000 light-years from Earth, the newfound rogue is much closer than the supermassive black hole at our Milky Way\u2019s center. That central black hole also lies in Sagittarius. It\u2019s also more than five times farther from us.",
            "The star-rich region around the galactic center offers a great hunting ground for other rogue black holes passing in front of stars. Sahu hopes to find additional such loners by using the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. It\u2019s due to launch in 2027."

            "Prototypes may be simple or complex. Early in the design process, a prototype may be a simple sketch. As someone learns more about what works \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 they build more complex prototypes.",

            "People use different types of prototypes for different purposes. A late-stage prototype that includes all or most of the product\u2019s final parts might called a working prototype. But many prototypes test only certain parts of an idea. Scientists call these proof-of-principle prototypes. For example, a prototype built to test a robot\u2019s wheels might lack a motor and other parts that would be crucial to the final product. But it does allow researchers to test a certain wheel\u2019s grip.",
            "In web design, a flowchart showing how a new website will work can serve as a prototype. The flowchart might help web developers envision and solve known problems. Or it could help them plan the most efficient site design.",

The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Was the figure a ghost? In the mythology of the United States and many other Western cultures, a ghost or spirit is a dead person who interacts with the living world. In stories, a ghost may whisper or groan, cause things to move or fall, mess with electronics \u2014 even appear as a shadowy, blurry or see-through figure.",

One night, a big thud prompted her to grab her camera. This was the first picture she took. Other photos she took on that and later nights showed nothing unusual. Does this story make it seem like ghosts exist? Or is the glowing figure a flash of light that the camera accidentally captured?",
            "Ghost stories are lots of fun, especially on Halloween. But some people believe that ghosts are real. Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",
            "On ghost-hunting TV shows, people use scientific equipment to attempt to record or measure spirit activity. And numerous creepy photos and videos make it seem like ghosts exist. However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",
            "Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager.",
            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",
            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",

            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",

Reading is not natural, she explains. We learn to talk by listening to those around us. It\u2019s pretty automatic. But learning to read takes real work. Wolf notes it\u2019s because the brain has no special network of cells just for reading.",
            "To understand text, the brain borrows networks that evolved to do other things. For example, the part that evolved to recognize faces is called into action to recognize letters. This is similar to how you might adapt a tool for some new use. For example, a coat hanger is great for putting your clothes in the closet. But if a blueberry rolls under the refrigerator, you might straighten out the coat hanger and use it to reach under the fridge and pull out the fruit. You\u2019ve taken a tool made for one thing and adapted it for something new. That\u2019s what the brain does when you read.",

But that flexibility can be a problem when it comes to reading different types of texts. When we read online, the brain creates a different set of connections between cells from the ones it uses for reading in print. It basically adapts the same tool again for the new task. This is like if you took a coat hanger and instead of straightening it out to fetch a blueberry, you twisted it into a hook to unclog a drain. Same original tool, two very different forms.",

Baron is a scientist who studies language and reading. She works at American University in Washington, D.C. Baron is the author of How We Read Now, a new book about digital reading and learning. She says one way mindset works is in anticipating how easy or hard we expect the reading to be. If we think it will be easy, we might not put in much effort.",

So, \u201cwhen people read on-screen, they read faster,\u201d says Alexander at the University of Maryland. \u201cTheir eyes scan the pages and the words faster than if they\u2019re reading on a piece of paper.\u201d",

Imagine that you turn on your phone to read an assignment for school. Your brain might fire up the networks it uses for skimming quickly through TikTok posts. That\u2019s not helpful if you\u2019re trying to understand the themes in that classic book, To Kill a Mockingbird.

Not just where you are on some particular page, but which page \u2014 potentially out of many. You might, for instance, remember that the part in the story where the dog died was near the top of the page on the left side. You don\u2019t have that sense of place when some enormously long page just scrolls past you. (Though some e-reading devices and apps do a pretty good job of simulating page turns.)",

When your mind has to keep up with scrolling down a page, she says, it doesn\u2019t have a lot of resources left for understanding what you\u2019re reading. This can be especially true if the passage you\u2019re reading is long or complicated. While scrolling down a page, your brain has to continually account for the placement of words in your view. And this can make it harder for you to simultaneously understand the ideas those words should convey.",

Only turn them back on when you\u2019re done reading.",
            "It\u2019s also a good idea to do a little prep. Baron compares reading to sports or to playing music. \u201cWatch a pianist or an athlete. Before they run the race or play the concerto, they get themselves in the zone,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing for reading. Before you read something you really want to focus on, get in the zone. Think about what you\u2019ll be reading, and what you want to get from it.\u201d",

            "fCPrint and digital each have their advantages. Sometimes it\u2019s best to use both. ",
            "To really get the most from reading, Baron says, you have to engage with the words on the page. One great technique for this is making notes. You can write summaries of what you\u2019ve read. You can make lists of key words. But one of the most useful ways to engage with what you\u2019re reading is to ask questions. Argue with the author. If something doesn\u2019t make sense, write down your question. You can look up the answer later. If you disagree, write down why. Make a good case for your point of view.",
            "If you\u2019re reading a print book, you can take notes on paper. If it\u2019s a printout or if you own the book, you can write directly on the page. You can do this when you\u2019re reading on your phone or tablet, too. Just keep a pad of paper handy while you read. Many apps also allow you to make virtual notes directly on a digital document, Luhtala points out. Some allow you to add virtual stickies. With some you can even write in the margins and turn down the corners of the virtual pages.",
            "Like most things, what you get from reading on-screen depends on what you put into it. You don\u2019t have to make a choice between print or digital. Alexander points out that when it comes to print versus digital, one is not better than the other. Both have their place. But they are different. So keep in mind that to learn well, how you interact with them may have to differ, too."

            "As a teen, Faria Sana often highlighted books with markers. \u201cThe colors were supposed to tell me different things.\u201d Later, she recalls, \u201cI had no idea what those highlighted texts were supposed to mean.\u201d",
            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",
            "Nate Kornell \u201cdefinitely did cram\u201d before big tests when he was a student. He\u2019s a psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",

            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",
            "*a_girl_explaining_something_to_her_mom",
            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",
            "*a_photo_of_a_person_running_away_from_the_viewer_on_a_leafy_path,_zoomed_in_on_the_feet_and_lower_le",
            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

            "One clue is that mosquitoes are able to taste the surfaces on which they land, Baik\u2019s team finds. In fact, sweat may play a big role in whether they bite. Human sweat contains water, salt and amino acids (the building blocks of proteins).",

            "The researchers then looked at activity in certain mosquito nerve cells involved in taste. The more-appealing sweat had a bigger effect on the activity of these nerves than the other sweat samples had.

Some bitter compounds, though, blocked the nerve cells\u2019 response to sugar. \u201cThis was exciting and surprising,\u201d says Baik.

She prefers \u201corganic products over synthetic ones.\u201d That led this sophomore at Garden City High School in New York to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in my sunscreen?\u201d",
            "These products protect our skin against blistering solar rays. But their use comes at a price. Some of sunscreen\u2019s chemicals may cause cancer, Taylor notes. And when these chemicals wash into our environment, they can hurt animals. For example, some mineral sunscreens interfere with the ability of freshwater animals to navigate. High enough exposures, she says, can kill some organisms.",
            "So, Taylor looked for alternatives to mineral-based sunscreens.\u00a0",
            "Bananas can naturally filter out much of the sun\u2019s more damaging rays. Could their natural sunblock replace mineral sunscreens? Taylor investigated. And what she found out won her a spot here in May at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF.",
            "Bananas tend to grow in a \u201cUV-intense environment,\u201d Taylor says. UV \u2014 short for ultraviolet \u2014 is a band of light wavelengths. This high-energy light is invisible to the human eye. But it causes most of the sun\u2019s damage to our skin. For a sunscreen to work, it must protect against certain UV rays.",
            "Taylor had reasoned that bananas \u201cmust have their own mechanism.\u201d After all, they grow near the equator. That\u2019s where UV exposures are strongest.",
            "Plants typically make flavonoids \u2014 pigments that come in a rainbow of colors \u2014 as a defense against the sun\u2019s UV. Taylor wondered if banana flavonoids might work to protect our skin from UV, too.",
            "She wasn\u2019t sure exactly which bananas flavonoids to use. Taylor heated, froze and blended the outer layer of a banana peel. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s exposed to the sunlight,\u201d she explains. Any UV-filtering chemicals likely lie there.",
            "Breaking open the cells released many of their chemicals. From this soup she made two extracts. One of these contained only components that would dissolve in water. That was her aqueous extract. The other contained only chemicals that wouldn\u2019t dissolve in water. That was her nonpolar extract. Nonpolar chemicals dissolve in oil rather than water.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A sunscreen must absorb UV light before it reaches your skin. And the more it absorbs, the better. To test how well each extract could do that, Taylor turned to a light-measuring tool. Called a spectrophotometer, it measures how much of any color of light a liquid absorbs.",
            "The tool confirmed that both of her banana extracts absorbed UV light. But the nonpolar one went a step further. It absorbed the full range of UV wavelengths \u2014 and especially the most damaging ones. They belong to a part of the UV spectrum called UV-A.",
            "Would banana-based sunscreens also be safe for the environment? After all, Taylor says, typical drug-store sunscreens can harm aquatic life. To find out, she recruited planarians (Girardia tigrina) as her \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d Planarians are a type of flatworm that live in water. They\u2019re often used in drug-safety studies, Taylor explains. A chemical that harms these worms might also pose a risk to other aquatic animals.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!10",
            "fCTaylor created two banana-extract solutions \u2014 one nonpolar and one aqueous. She also created mineral-sunscreen solutions for comparison. Spectrophotometry allowed her to test wavelengths of light absorbed by each sample. She also used a microscope to observe planarians\u2019 locomotion \u2014 or movement \u2014 when exposed to UV light.",
            "The plan was to put planarians into dishes with different extracts and expose them to strong UV light for 10 minutes. If the worm\u2019s movement slowed or stopped, she took that to mean the light damaged them. Her five test solutions included her two extracts, a drugstore sunscreen solution, plain water and glycerol.",
            "Why glycerol? The nonpolar extract and sunscreen solution both contained this thick liquid. Taylor tested glycerol by itself to check if it caused problems on its own.",
            "And it did. \u201cThe nonpolar banana, the glycerol and the mineral sunscreen [appeared] fatal\u201d to the worms, she found. \u201cThey stopped moving.\u201d",
            "That \u201cwas surprising,\u201d Taylor says. Glycerol \u201cis actually an ingredient found in a lot of sunscreens,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not known to hurt people. But she\u2019s \u201cpretty sure\u201d it killed her planarians.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!11",
            "fCTaylor used these peels to create her banana extracts.",
            "In a later test, Taylor would notice that glycerol damaged planarians\u2019 skin \u2014 even with no UV exposure. Glycerol is used in many products. Taylor\u2019s work now suggests it might pose risks to aquatic life.",
            "But planarians survived just fine in the aqueous extract. And these outperformed the water-only group \u2014 the only other ones left alive, the teen says.",
            "Taylor confirmed this later when she stained those same planarians. She used a special dye. It stains damaged tissue so that it glows under her microscope\u2019s UV light. Basically, the more glow, the more damage there is.",
            "The three glycerol-exposed groups exhibited the most damage. The aqueous extract group showed the least. Where damage did show up, Taylor says, it looked \u201cspotty.\u201d That probably means a worm \u201cwas not fully coated.\u201d",
            "The next step is figuring out exactly what chemical provided the aqueous extract\u2019s UV protection. Identifying that, she says, could allow for a new class of eco-friendly, banana-based sunscreens.",
            "Regeneron ISEF is a program created and run by the Society of Science (which also publishes this magazine). Taylor was among 1,657 students \u2014 from 62 nations or territories \u2014 competing at the 75th annual ISEF. They shared in nearly $9 million in prizes."

Yellowstone\u2019s volcanic activity started about 1.2 million years ago. Over time, multiple vent-like eruptions created a vast caldera system throughout the region. The last eruption occurred about 600,000 years ago. Geologists think this one was massive. It emptied the caldera\u2019s magma chamber. Without magma to support it, the ground caved in. That created Yellowstone\u2019s largest caldera, which stretches 113 kilometers (70 miles) across.",

The stories tell of fire and rock bursting from the ground. Landslides followed. Finally, Mount Mazama caved into the void below. Over time, the caldera filled with rainwater. That\u2019s why today, it is a lake. Crater Lake remains a sacred place to these tribes.",

Animals exhale carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. And when plants and animals die, the carbon from their tissues gets released into the air and soil. That carbon can get locked up in rock like limestone or fossil fuels such as coal.",

When those organisms die, their remains sink and can either dissolve into deep sea waters or settle into the seafloor. Carbon locked up underground can also be violently blasted back out into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions.",

A big way we do this is by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil for energy. But other human activities, such as farming and cutting down forests, add carbon to the atmosphere as well.

            "When rain or snow falls, much of it seeps into the soil. From there it flows down through porous rock, gravel and sand, forming underground streams. This groundwater will sometimes travel long distances. Scientists have now attempted to calculate its path in North America. Their findings suggest water can travel below ground much farther and deeper \u2014 and for a much longer time \u2014 than had been expected.",
            "For instance, some groundwater can travel up to 238 kilometers (148 miles), the new study reports. And it can seep to depths of more than 90 meters (300 feet).",
            "Or consider the deep groundwater pumped up for drinking. Most was believed to be separate from polluted water that often resurfaces in streams and rivers. But through long, buried treks, groundwater can link areas thought to be separate \u2014 sharing pollution it picked up along the way.\u00a0",
            "All that water now appears \u201ca lot more connected,\u201d says Reed Maxwell, an author of the new study. He works at Princeton University in New Jersey. As a hydrologist, he studies the movement of water.",
            "His team shared its findings on how water moves in the January 6 issue of Nature Water.",
            "Understanding these connections between water sources, they say, is important. It could help water managers work together to make better decisions about how to use water for drinking, irrigating crops and supporting ecosystems.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A watershed (also known as a catchment) is the broad expanse of land that funnels snowmelt and rain downhill to a body of open water (such as a lake or ocean). Some rain and snowmelt will remain above ground. But much will seep underground as it moves.",
            "Water managers decide who gets to use the water within a watershed and how. Watersheds are managed separately. But water can flow freely underground across watershed boundaries, says Laura Condon. She\u2019s a hydrologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson.\u00a0",
            "If watersheds are connected, then problems in one might affect another, says Maxwell. This got him thinking: \u201cIf you dump pollution in one watershed, does it get to another?\u201d\u00a0",
            "Others had mapped groundwater flows in various parts of the United States. But how distant sources of underground water might be connected hadn\u2019t been clear. That was one motivation for this study, says Maxwell. Understanding how water moves across a continent underground can help show how, when and where impacts to that water may occur.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Maxwell and Condon\u2019s team decided to track groundwater\u2019s flow beneath most of continental North America. They started with where this water reemerges in streams. Then, working backward, they figured out where it must have first seeped into the Earth.",
            "To do this, they built a computer model. It simulated North America\u2019s underground layers of rock to depths of 392 meters (1,200 feet). Next, they divided the continent into little blocks. Each was one kilometer long by one kilometer wide.",
            "Then they asked the model to calculate how much water would likely flow through each block. That would depend on the shape and thickness of Earth\u2019s underground layers and the space between the rocks.",
            "Each block is like a Lego brick, Maxwell says. Once they calculated water\u2019s flow in each one, they stacked them together \u2014 85 million of them.",
            "Then they added simulated water droplets to the computer model. The model \u201cpushes\u201d these droplets around based on how water would flow through the layers of below ground rock. And the scientists tracked everywhere they would go.",
            "\u201cThink of a video game: Where would the little ball go? It\u2019ll be pushed by the velocity this way,\u201d says Condon. \u00a0Then, \u201cwhere would it go next?\u201d",
            "Water often travels more than 97 kilometers (60 miles), the model showed. That wouldn\u2019t be far if water was streaming across the surface, says Maxwell. But it was far longer than it had been expected to flow below ground.",
            "Most water stays below the surface for five to 10 years, the model found. But buried aquifers (underground layers of water-filled rock) also exist. Water can collect in them for 100,000 to 1 million years.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/zyHtkDCwQUw?feature=oembed",
            "Rain and snow seep into the Earth, forming streams of groundwater that travel long distances below the surface.",
            "Knowing how far water travels and for how long helps determine impacts to water. How? \u201cIf you have pollution underground, you need to understand where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Maxwell explains.",
            "Consider, for instance, the nitrate fertilizers that farmers apply to soils. In large amounts, nitrates can harm people and aquatic life. Rain can wash these chemicals into groundwater. From there, they can potentially travel far from the farms on which they had been used. That can pollute water once thought to be free of such chemicals.",
            "Models might also point to where water being pumped from the ground at one site (for drinking or irrigation) had been on its way to hydrate a distant wetland. Knowing this, says Claudia Faunt, managers might then make sure they leave enough water in the ground to sustain that wetland \u2014 and the ecosystem it supports. Faunt didn\u2019t take part in the new study. But as a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in San Diego, Calif., she understands these issues.\u00a0",
            "\u201cEverything\u2019s connected,\u201d Maxwell says. By knowing how one watershed may be linked to others, you can understand how the system works as a whole, he explains. And that could be key to managing Earth\u2019s life-giving resource. \u00a0"

This escape feature sets their technology apart from other coral-transplant systems, says Jiho. Few such technologies can flee danger. And those that do need a lot of human help. Human labor makes them \u201cless efficient in both cost and time,\u201d Jiho says.",

As a comparative ethologist, she studies the behaviors of animals, often in the wild. Much of her work has focused on contagious behaviors \u2014 including yawning \u2014 in primates, such as monkeys and apes.",
            "In a new study, she and her team were curious to confirm whether fish yawn \u2014 and if it\u2019s contagious in them, too. People with freshwater aquariums often keep zebrafish (Danio rerio). That\u2019s the species Palagi\u2019s team chose for this work.",

And about half the time, a yawning fish also stretched its body. This is \u201cvery interesting,\u201d Palagi says, and something \u201cwe absolutely did not expect to find.\u201d (Yawning people also tend to stretch their bodies about half of the time, she notes.)",

And sometimes it\u2019s a lot of pressure. Like when you\u2019re running or scared. When this happens, what protects your blood vessels against bursting? A new study shows how they cope: Vessel cells morph their structures on a super tiny level.",

They lined this vessel, just 120 micrometers (0.0047 inch) wide, with human cells. As in the human body, this inner layer was thin \u2014 just one cell thick.

            "Before the pressure, the actin ran along the length of the vessel. It looked like train tracks, but more spread out. After pressure was applied, the proteins now wrapped around the inside of the vessel.",
            "Next, the team removed the actin from the cells and ran the experiment again. Without actin, the tissue became much softer. Now, it couldn\u2019t handle pressure well.

            "In June 2017, Cathy Raley was about to take her dog on a hike when she suddenly broke out in hives. Her tongue swelled and her throat got tight. \u201cThat\u2019s when I called 911,\u201d she recalls.",
            "On the way to the hospital, Raley stopped being able to swallow. She was immediately given a steroid. She also received a medicine for severe allergic reactions called epinephrine (Ep-ih-NEFF-rin). That eventually calmed her symptoms, though Raley had to spend four hours in the hospital before she could go home.",
            "She\u2019d clearly suffered a major allergic reaction \u2014 but to what? She was 61 years old and didn\u2019t know of anything she was allergic to. So she went to an allergist who combed through her history for clues to what happened.",
            "One hint: Raley had recently had another bout of hives. That one erupted in the middle of the night \u2014 a sign that it had been a delayed reaction to something. And both times, the hives had occurred after she\u2019d cooked red meat: beef and pork.",
            "\u201cI have no idea if it\u2019s related,\u201d Raley finally told the allergist, but \u201ctwo months ago, I got bitten by a tick.\u201d",
            "That turned out to be the key to solving Raley\u2019s mystery.",

            "fCCathy Raley has picked up ticks on hikes with her dog, Jake, in the wooded outskirts of Olympia, Wash. But one bite in particular may have sparked a severe allergic reaction.",
            "She was later diagnosed with alpha-gal syndrome. This is an allergy to red meat that scientists knew could develop in response to the bite of a lone star tick. Raley, however, had been bitten while hiking near her home in Olympia, Wash. Lone star ticks are found only east of the Rocky Mountains \u2014 thousands of kilometers (miles) away.",
            "Two new research reports \u2014 one on Raley\u2019s case and\u00a0another on a woman in Maine \u2014\u00a0now suggest the lone star tick isn\u2019t the only U.S. tick that can trigger this allergy. The western blacklegged tick and the deer tick may trigger an allergy to red meat, too.",
            "\u201cIt was a very surprising finding,\u201d says Hanna Oltean. She works at Washington State\u2019s Department of Health in Shoreline. As an epidemiologist, she studies the spread and control of diseases. Oltean was part of a team that described the two alpha-gal cases in Emerging Infectious Diseases in April.",

            "Scientists discovered alpha-gal syndrome in 2009.",
            "It was first reported in 24 people who\u2019d had allergic reactions a few hours after eating red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. More than eight in every 10 of them recalled being bitten by ticks before showing these symptoms. That raised scientists\u2019 suspicions that tick bites may have triggered the allergies.",
            "The saliva of certain tick species carries a sugar molecule called alpha-gal. These species include the lone star tick and others found in Europe and Australia. When these ticks bite, the sugar molecule and other compounds can get into someone\u2019s body. There, they can somehow make the immune systems go haywire.",
            "The next exposure to alpha-gal may trigger an allergic reaction in these people. Red meats and other animal products (such as milk and gelatin) are rich in alpha-gal. So those foods could incite that bad reaction.",

            "fCScientists knew that alpha-gal syndrome could develop in response to the bite of a lone star tick (shown). But new research suggests that other types of ticks can trigger this allergy as well.",
            "\u201cAlpha-gal syndrome can present very differently from patient to patient,\u201d says Johanna Salzer. This epidemiologist works at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga.",
            "Some people may get hives and throat swelling, as Raley did. Other cases may look more like the woman from Maine. She\u2019d been bitten by a deer tick. Later, after eating red meat, she developed abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.",
            "The delayed and often mysterious nature of a patient\u2019s stomach issues can make alpha-gal syndrome hard to diagnose, says Sarah McGill. As a gastroenterologist, she specializes in the digestive system. She works at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill.",
            "In the past, doctors hadn\u2019t considered food allergies when seeing adult patients with chronic digestive problems, she says. Why? Most food allergies develop when people are young. \u201cBut alpha-gal syndrome is very unique,\u201d she says. \u201cAdults can get it suddenly.\u201d And there\u2019s no cure \u2014 though some people may eventually be able to eat red meat again without issue.\u00a0",
            "Another problem: Many doctors and nurses have never heard of alpha-gal syndrome.",
            "In one U.S. survey of healthcare providers,\u00a0more than four in every 10 had not heard of the condition. Among those who had, about one in three didn\u2019t know how it was acquired. Nearly half didn\u2019t know\u00a0what tests to order\u00a0to diagnose it. Salzer and her colleagues shared these results in 2023.",
            "A bite from certain tick species could leave you allergic to red meat. Lone star tick bites can trigger alpha-gal syndrome \u2014 a mysterious allergy to a sugar molecule found in red meat, milk and gelatin. Now, scientists have identified two additional tick species in the U.S. that may also be responsible for causing this condition. Watch for tips from scientists on how to avoid tick bites, especially if you spend a lot of time in the woods. #tickseason #ticks #alphagalsyndrome #redmeat #redmeatallergy #allergyproblems #science #sciencenews ",
            "McGill has seen patients whose alpha-gal symptoms were dismissed by other doctors. When patients asked to be tested for the condition, some doctors had refused.",
            "Those experiences remind McGill of celiac disease, another digestive illness. Here, the immune system overreacts to gluten. This disease was misunderstood for a long time. Patients were sometimes told their symptoms were in their head, McGill says. \u201cI see that same pattern happening with alpha-gal syndrome.\u201d",
            "Increasing awareness among doctors and nurses could speed up diagnosis, Salzer says. That in turn could help patients feel better faster.",
            "It\u2019s hard to know just how many patients we\u2019re talking about. While alpha-gal syndrome appears fairly rare, exact numbers are hard to pin down. Salzer was part of a team that tallied about\u00a0110,000 suspected cases in the United States from 2010 to 2022. But this might be an undercount. As many as 450,000 people might have been affected during this time, those researchers say.",
            "And this condition can be life-threatening, Oltean emphasizes. But if people know the risks, she adds, \u201cthey can take appropriate precautions.\u201d",
            "For Oltean, that means avoiding tick bites. She knows that can be difficult, especially during tick season. Ticks are generally seeking blood meals from early spring to late fall, depending on where you live.",
            "After being outdoors, many people scan their bodies to ensure they\u2019re not carrying any ticks. Quickly finding and removing those tiny arachnids can keep them from spreading diseases. That\u2019s the case for Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A tick must latch onto someone\u2019s body for hours or days to transmit the bacteria that cause those illnesses.",
            "\u201cThat does not seem to be the case with alpha-gal syndrome,\u201d Oltean says. There are no bacteria being transmitted. Tick saliva is thought to cause the allergy. So it\u2019s possible that a single bite from a tick \u2014 even one yanked away at once \u2014 could spark the condition.\u00a0",
            "Suspected cases of alpha-gal syndrome cluster mostly in the southern, midwestern and mid-Atlantic United States. This map shows cases from 2017 to 2022. Cases are shown per 1 million people in the population per year. Areas with larger case counts are shown in dark blue.",

            "Oltean is brimming with tips to prevent tick bites. Walk in the center of trails. Avoid tall brush and grassy areas. Wear tightly woven clothing. Apply tick repellent to exposed skin, and shower soon after being outdoors.\u00a0",
            "Since alpha-gal syndrome was discovered so recently, there\u2019s still a lot to learn about who\u2019s most at risk.",
            "\u201cWhy are some people bitten by ticks all the time and they never develop alpha-gal syndrome?\u201d Salzer asks. She also wants to know just how long a tick must attach for someone to get the condition.",
            "Her research suggests that most U.S. alpha-gal cases have happened in the lone star ticks\u2019 range. Oltean wonders why lone star ticks seem better at triggering an immune response. And do multiple tick bites over time make someone more likely to develop the condition?\u00a0",
