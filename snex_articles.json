            "Many trees shed their leaves for the winter to save energy. So for those who live in northern climates, trying to identify species based on their foliage can be next to impossible at that time of year. ",
            "Guides to identifying trees usually rely on leaves to distinguish between species. But if you live where it gets cold in winter, the trees around you may look a little barer at this time of year. Many trees shed their leaves to save energy during the chilly season. This can leave trees looking sleepy and dreary \u2014 and largely the same as each other. Still, it\u2019s possible to ID many trees, even when their branches are empty. It just requires peering closer and paying a little more attention to other parts of the plant.",
            "You might have to turn over twigs, for instance. Or gently squeeze tree buds. Or run your fingers over chilly bark.",
            "Tree identification is a dying art, scientists note. Simply put, fewer of us know how to do it. Yet the practice is becoming more and more important.",
            "Plant and tree identification help scientists manage forests and protect these ecosystems from climate change. And you don\u2019t need to be a scientist to benefit from tree-ID skills. Learning to pick out different species can help you appreciate the diversity of life right in your own backyard, neighborhood or nearby woods.",
            "\u201cI am still constantly amazed and curious about what\u2019s out there,\u201d says Steven Roberge. He\u2019s a forest ecologist at the University of New Hampshire Extension in Durham. \u201cI\u2019ve been a forester for almost 25 years now, and there\u2019s not a day in the woods where I don\u2019t see or experience something new.\u201d",
            "Finding a field guide at your local library or bookstore will help you ID the exact trees in your area. Each species has its own unique tells. But there are a few general strategies to examining any tree that can help you recognize what you\u2019re looking at.",

            "Winter may strip away a tree\u2019s striking leaves \u2014 but that can also better reveal the plant\u2019s intricate network of woody arms. And those branches and twigs can offer clues to their host\u2019s identity.",
            "Trees usually grow new arms in two distinct patterns. You can sometimes see this by looking at how smaller twigs (the newest growth) break off from larger branches (older arms that grow out of the trunk). Many tree species alternate\u00a0growing new twigs on each side of the older arm. Others grow new twigs in pairs, on\u00a0opposite sides of the original branch.",

            "If you find an opposite-branching pattern, you\u2019re in luck. You can now rule out most tree species. Opposite branching often means it\u2019s a maple, ash or dogwood (the acronym MAD can you help remember this trio). These trees can be found in many places across North America. Many other common trees in the United States \u2014 such as oaks, birch and locusts \u2014 sprout branches in an alternating pattern.",
            "But pay close attention. Branches can fall off and make the sprouting pattern less clear. Sometimes, it\u2019s easier to determine a tree\u2019s branching pattern by looking at the tips of twigs, the newest part of a branch. There you\u2019ll find tree buds growing alternately or oppositely, too.",
            "Buds are tiny, scaly nubs. Baby leaves spend the winter inside them. Come spring, new twigs can grow from buds, too. Because they are so distinct from one tree species to the next, buds are an important part of winter tree identification.",

            "\u201cBuds can be all shapes, sizes and colors,\u201d notes Julia Alards-Tomalin. She\u2019s a plant specialist at the British Columbia Institute of Technology in Burnaby, Canada. \u201cThey can be hairy. They can be smooth. They can be sticky. Or they can be smelly.\u201d",
            "Buds on oak trees, for example, don\u2019t grow alone. If the tip of a twig bears four or more stubby buds, it might be some type of oak. On birches, meanwhile, the buds are usually accompanied by catkins \u2014 dangling seed sacks that are soft to the touch. Hawthorn trees guard their buds notoriously well. Spiky thorns grow up and down their branches, in between the buds. And ash trees often grow tiny brown buds the same shape and color \u2014 though not the same taste \u2014 as candy: Hershey\u2019s Kisses.",
            "If you can\u2019t see the budded tips of any twigs high in a tree, try looking down. Twigs with buds often get snapped off by squirrels, beetles and the wind. One might be waiting for an ID right at your feet.",

            "While many North American trees have gray trunks, there are a handful of species that stick out in the crowd. Beech trees, for instance, are wrapped in smooth and silvery bark. Birch trees have white bark that peels and curls, almost like paper. London plane trees, popular on city sidewalks, have trunks with bark that seems to be falling off to reveal soft, white wood beneath. And if you spot a tree that looks like it has thousands of burnt potato chips glued to its trunk, you might be fortunate enough to have found a black cherry.",

And if you can\u2019t get outside, you can still practice indoors with online plant-ID games. Whatever you choose, it\u2019s bound to make you feel more in tune with the greenery living nearby.",

            "A cyclist is pedaling down the street. Signs, trees and fire hydrants whip by. As the rider bikes along, their brain takes in information from what they\u2019ve perceived but can no longer see. There are all sorts of info \u2014 the color, shape and text on signs, for example. The cyclist\u2019s brain sorts through it all and selects what is most important. Based on that, the biker takes the correct turn and continues on.\u00a0",
            "Freek van Ede uses a lot of bicycling metaphors. This makes sense for a researcher in the Netherlands. Bicycling is very popular there. A cognitive neuroscientist at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, van Ede studies attention.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "His focus is not on external attention. That\u2019s what someone is looking at or attending to in the moment. Instead, van Ede is trying to understand internal attention. This is how the brain takes all the information coming in from the environment and selects exactly what it needs to guide future behavior.\u00a0",
            "Van Ede thinks of the brain as an organ of anticipation. Think about when you\u2019re riding a bike. You use your recent experience to guide upcoming actions. This is a process our brains are performing all the time when we are awake. \u201cIt\u2019s really at the core of cognition,\u201d van Ede says.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "This process depends on working memory. That\u2019s the ability to store information short-term. But the process also requires attention. We have to select from all that stored information to translate it into action. \u201cIt\u2019s really a fundamental process. And I think that\u2019s what appeals to me about it. And I want to understand how it works,\u201d van Ede says.\u00a0",
            "Van Ede hopes to combine studies of working memory and attention to get a better understanding of thought as a whole. Along the way, he and his colleagues have developed new techniques to measure exactly how people might be processing the world around them.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",

            "fC\u202fBy using electroencephalography, van Ede\u2019s lab can \u201cwatch\u201d how the brains of study participants react to the world in real time.\u00a0",
            "Van Ede attended Utrecht University in the Netherlands for his undergraduate studies. There, he was thrilled to find out that he could continue studying and learning for his whole career. All he had to do was become a scientist.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "He especially recalls what drew him to his eventual postdoctoral mentor, Kia Nobre. She is now at Yale University in New Haven, Conn. Van Ede remembers \u201cjust reading her studies and thinking, \u2018Hey, there\u2019s somebody doing things a bit different than most people do it.\u2019\u201d\u00a0",
            "At the time, most cognitive neuroscientists were looking at attention in terms of 3-D space. An example is an experiment where blocks are placed in different places on a screen. A person would then be asked to select among the blocks. Nobre, however, was interested in how time might play a role.\u00a0",
            "Van Ede began thinking about the question of time, too. After all, we don\u2019t spend our lives frozen in time, responding to objects on a screen. We move through the world and see things in sequence. \u201cWhen we perform a dance, or even ride a bike or anything we do,\u201d van Ede says, \u201cour movements are carefully orchestrated in time.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Getting a more real-world picture means measuring brain activity in real time. This is why van Ede uses electroencephalography, or EEG. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of remarkable that we can put an electrode on somebody\u2019s skull \u2026 and we can measure electrical activity emitted by the brain,\u201d he says. \u201cThat means we can measure brain activity as it\u2019s happening.\u201d People can also move freely in EEG caps. That means they can encounter the world in a more natural way while being studied.\u00a0",
            "At first, van Ede and his colleagues were pairing EEG with eye-tracking data. This was a way to ensure participants looked at what they were told to. \u201cOne day, I decided to actually dive in and explore the eye data,\u201d van Ede says. \u201cOut of curiosity, really.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "He found that when someone was asked to recall something about an object that had been on the screen, their gaze flicked toward where the object had been. They did this even though the object was no longer there.\u00a0",

            "That flicking was detectable as microsaccades. These are tiny, unconscious movements that your eyes make multiple times per second. These movements are invisible to the naked eye. And they are smaller than the ones that your eyes make two to three times per second to take in a visual scene.\u00a0",
            "When study participants shifted their attention to focus on where an object had been, the microsaccades were pulled in the direction of that attention shift. \u201cWe soon realized this discovery also opened new opportunities for \u2018tracking the mind\u2019s eye,\u2019\u201d van Ede says. And that let his team decipher what information the brain is using to plan future action.\u00a0",
            "His lab has used the technique to show that when preparing for the future, the brain doesn\u2019t wait to make a plan. Instead, the brain plans possible actions as each piece of information comes in.\u00a0",

            "A basic understanding of how the brain plans actions could someday help us understand memory disorders or attention problems. But that\u2019s not the primary driver for van Ede. What he and his team choose to study is \u201ca little bit based on our intuition, even what is interesting,\u201d van Ede says.\u00a0",
            "In recent work, van Ede and colleagues are looking for signs of the repeated shifts of microsaccades while people play in virtual reality. Study participants work inside a virtual world where objects flow past, like signs would on a street. Van Ede tracks the tiny eye movements to see how people\u2019s brains are using the information they recently encountered to make a plan. It\u2019s one step closer to biking through the streets of Amsterdam.\u00a0"

            "The flaps turned out to affect flow in two ways. Flaps near the front of an airfoil helped keep the air flowing around it closer to the wing. That improved the wing\u2019s lift and reduced its drag. Adding more rows of flaps enhanced the effect.",
            "Installing a single row of flaps near the rear of an airfoil brought a different benefit. It blocked high-pressure air near the trailing edge of the wing from creeping toward the wing front. That\u2019s key, because low pressure is needed in the front to produce lift, Wissa explains. Adding five rows of flaps to airfoils improved lift by up to 45 percent. At the same time, it reduced drag by 31 percent.",
            "Further tests with remote-controlled aircraft showed that the bird-inspired flaps reduced stall and improved flight stability. That might be especially helpful while flying through heavy gusts, or during landings on very short runways. Without the flaps, you might not be able to safely complete such maneuvers, Wissa says. \u201cBut now, you can.\u201d"

At its best, it was 3.1 \u00baC (5.6 \u00baF) cooler than the flat wall. A cooler wall means less heat was transferred through the wall to warm the interior.

            "Sonic isn\u2019t your typical hedgehog. He boasts incredible superspeed that lets him launch off springs, sprint over water and even clear loop-de-loops. In the Sonic the Hedgehog games, our favorite blue hedgehog runs through these loops to complete levels. If he enters one too slowly, though, he risks falling off the track. \u00a0Animals \u2014 including hedgehogs \u2014 don\u2019t typically run through loops. Instead, climbing creatures rely on specialized limbs to scale vertical surfaces. That leaves few role models in the animal kingdom for Sonic\u2019s upside-down antics. But roller-coaster carts, race cars and even advanced parkour runners can clear loops.\u00a0",
            "\u200b\u200b\u200bSonic could take advantage of the same physics for his stunts, says \u200b\u200bPaolo Segre. He studies biomechanics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay. The key to clearing a large loop is \u201cspeed, speed, speed,\u201d Segre says. \u201cThat\u2019s all that really matters \u2014 and some decent shoes.\u201d \u00a0",
            "As Sonic approaches the top of the loop, two downward forces act on him: gravity and the \u201cnormal force\u201d exerted by the track. Together, these forces create a centripetal force that keeps Sonic on his circular path through the loop. Sonic\u2019s inertia, which is his resistance to a change in motion, helps him maintain his high speed as he moves through the loop. That allows him to clear the top without falling off the track.\u00a0",
            "Like a roller-coaster car, Sonic needs to reach a minimum speed to do this. But that speed would barely be a light jog for such a fast hedgehog, says Segre. Sonic can sustain speeds of some 1,200 kilometers (760 miles) per hour. That\u2019s about the speed of sound. \u00a0",

            "Loops pop up in most Sonic the Hedgehog levels. But loops are rare in nature, says \u200b\u200bMostafa Hassanalian. At the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, Hassanalian designs robots inspired by animals. A lack of natural loops means most animals haven\u2019t evolved to run through these obstacles, he says. Instead, animals such as insects and geckos use specialized limbs to climb vertical surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Many insects run up surfaces using tiny claws and hairs on their legs that grip little pits and cracks. Geckos have thousands of tiny fibers under their feet that bond with a surface\u2019s molecules. Called van der Waals forces, these weak bonds are easily broken when the gecko lifts its foot.\u00a0\u00a0Sonic\u2019s hair may also help him clear loops \u2014 but not by gripping the track. Hedgehog quills are actually hardened, modified hairs. In the real world, these needle-like hairs protect hedgehogs from predators. Sonic\u2019s quills, though, may make him more aerodynamic, notes Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0Speedy animals such as cheetahs and horses need to reduce drag, or resistance to their motion caused by moving through air. An object\u2019s shape determines how much drag it experiences. Sonic\u2019s quills might reduce drag on his body by preventing large vortices, or whirls of air, from whipping up around him. The quills\u2019 jagged edges could cut these whirls into smaller vortices less likely to disturb airflow, says Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0He likens it to the vortex generators found on a race car. As a car speeds along, air passes along its surface. If this flow drifts away from the car, it can make the airflow turbulent, resulting in increased drag. Vortex generators are fins on a car that create small vortices, which redirect air back toward the car\u2019s surface. That helps stabilize the car at high speeds. \u00a0",

            "The physics behind race cars don\u2019t just apply to Sonic. Birds also take cues from racing to scale vertical surfaces. Most birds tackle tricky inclines using wing-assisted incline running, says Segre. \u200b\u200bWhen running up a slope, two-legged animals angle their bodies parallel to the surface. But this makes it hard to maintain the proper grip needed for climbing.\u00a0\u00a0So what can birds do? Flap their wings. \u201cThe wingbeats push them into the ground, kind of like the spoiler on a race car,\u201d says Segre. Like vortex generators, a spoiler is a device that affects how air flows over a vehicle. This disrupted airflow helps create a downward force that presses race cars into the ground, improving grip, or traction, between the tires and the road.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cOnce [birds] have that traction, they can actually use their legs to run,\u201d Segre says. This lets birds navigate different terrain, forage for food and escape predators. \u201cWe especially see it in baby birds who are not yet good at flying.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In experiments, this clever trick even let birds run up inverted walls \u2014 surfaces that slant toward the climber as they rise. No other two-legged animal manages this feat. \u201cWe see tons of climbing animals that are [four-legged],\u201d says Segre. This is because four-legged animals can \u201ckeep their body right up against the wall like a rock climber.\u201d By keeping their center of gravity close to the surface, they\u2019re less likely to tip over backward. Wing-assisted incline running helps birds hug similarly close to steep surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0Still, even wing-assisted birds aren\u2019t able to run upside down like Sonic. And their tactic for scaling inclines isn\u2019t what Segre would expect for our blue hero. While birds mostly use their legs to ascend, their wings are essential to getting enough traction. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really what Sonic does,\u201d says Segre. \u201cHe just uses pure speed.\u201d \u00a0",

Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",
            "Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth\u2019s inner structure. They\u2019ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists \u2014 \u00a0including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago \u2014 have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth\u2019s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

She works at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.",
            "Nicknamed Percy, the rover turned up this potential sign of life in mid-July. The robot had drilled into a reddish rock at a site known as Cheyava Falls. (It was named for a feature at the Grand Canyon.) This is the first piece of Mars that Percy found containing organic molecules. Here, the term organic refers to carbon-based molecules. On Earth, they\u2019re the building blocks of life.",

But since Percy\u00a0landed in Jezero Crater three years ago, scientists have struggled to identify organics, Stack Morgan says. That landing site was an ancient, dried-up lake.",
            "Adding to the new excitement, little white spots with black rims speckle the reddish rock sample that Percy found. \u201cThey look like a tricolored leopard spot,\u201d Stack Morgan says.",

            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills.

Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",

In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",

Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself.

            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",

            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",

            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",

            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action.

Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",

But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone.

Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",

Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",

One night, a big thud prompted her to grab her camera. This was the first picture she took. Other photos she took on that and later nights showed nothing unusual. Does this story make it seem like ghosts exist? Or is the glowing figure a flash of light that the camera accidentally captured?",
            "Ghost stories are lots of fun, especially on Halloween. But some people believe that ghosts are real. Chapman University in Orange, Calif., runs a yearly survey that asks people in the United States about their beliefs in the paranormal. In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",
            "On ghost-hunting TV shows, people use scientific equipment to attempt to record or measure spirit activity. And numerous creepy photos and videos make it seem like ghosts exist. However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",
            "Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager.",
            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",
            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo?feature=oembed",

            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "The team varied how much of the inside of each tube a helix covered. Some helices were skinny and left a large opening in the middle. Others seemed to fill the entire tube when you peered through one end. The researchers also varied the angle of the helix. Sometimes it was nearly perpendicular to the tube wall. Other times it was slanted sharply downward from the tube\u2019s wall.",

In half of the tests, the tubes were attached with the helix pointing down, just like a spiral slide. This is the way a shark\u2019s intestine is oriented. The other times, this helix pointed up, like an upside-down slide.",
            "When the helix pointed down, water flowed two to three times faster than when it had been pointed upward. The helix had therefore helped keep water flowing in one direction.

            "A vampire bat working out on a tiny treadmill helped scientists figure out the quirks of its metabolism.",
            "Vampire bats live on a strictly blood-based diet. So strict, in fact, that they seem to process their food more like some blood-feeding flies than like other known mammals.",
            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",
            "Researchers shared these findings November 6 in\u00a0Biology Letters.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/rjBtx8AMR_Q?start=3&feature=oembed",
            "Researchers put vampire bats through their paces on a mini treadmill to discover what fuels their metabolism.",
            "The discovery means the vampire bats power along much like blood-feeding tsetse flies or some mosquitoes. That\u2019s a first for mammals, thinks Ken Welch. He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often."

            "A mountainside in Greenland collapsed catastrophically into the ocean, last year. The landslide triggered a wave as tall as the Statue of Liberty. This wave \u2014 a tsunami \u2014 swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down a fjord there. Its rapid and violent motion ripped up the coastline. And its vibrations were so violent that they were detected worldwide.",
            "Indeed, they rang the planet like a seismic bell every minute and a half \u2014 for nine straight days.",
            "The good news: No one was hurt. Large tourist ships ventured into that same fjord on the days before and after the tsunami. They were ferrying people on and off a beach with small boats, according to Kristian Svennevig.",
            "\u201cIt was pure luck that no one was there when it happened,\u201d he says. The powerful wave would have easily capsized the small boats and swept the people away.",
            "Svennevig is a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). He\u2019s based in Copenhagen, Denmark. He led a team that investigated the event. They now believe that Earth\u2019s warming climate set off the massive landslide that started it all. They described their findings September 13 in Science.",
            "Aside from those caused by earthquakes and volcanoes, \u201cmost landslides around the world you can tie to climatic factors,\u201d says Svennevig. And as Earth keeps warming, he worries, this dangerous event could be a warning of worse things to come.",
            "Saturday, September 16, 2023, started normally enough. But then at 11:35 a.m., sensors in Asia and North America picked up a sharp seismic signal. They detected waves rippling from a remote part of Greenland\u2019s east coast.",
            "Earthquakes typically cause such vibrations. But explosions, tsunamis and volcanoes can, too. Initially, the source here was unknown.",
            "The next day, tourists on a cruise ship noticed damage to an abandoned research station on east Greenland\u2019s Ella Island. Equipment that was stored on land, including a boat and a truck-size shipping container, had been washed into the sea.",
            "Svennevig heard these reports when he arrived at work Monday morning. Suspecting a tsunami, he looked through recent satellite images of the area. He hoped they would offer clues.",

The volume of this debris was equal to 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This rock and ice tumbled off the end of the glacier and into the fjord\u2019s water.",

            "fCA mountain ridge overlooking this glacier in Greenland collapsed into a massive landslide. The tsunami it triggered swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down the fjord. Climate warming set off the disaster by causing the glacier to thin, which destabilized the mountain ridge that it had supported.",
            "The resulting splash threw water 200 meters (650 feet) up the nearby mountain slopes. The wave it triggered was 110 meters (360 feet) tall. It may have sped along the fjord at 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour or more!",
            "But there wasn\u2019t just a single wave.",
            "This explosive event provoked a repeating wave called a seiche (SAYSH). It resembled the back-and-forth sloshing of water in a bathtub. Except here it was way bigger \u2014 echoing through the fjord every 90 seconds for nine straight days.",
            "Though sudden, this catastrophe was caused by changes that have been slowly happening for decades. Earth\u2019s warming climate has shrunk the glacier by Dickson Fjord over time. No one knows how quickly it was losing ice. But other glaciers in this part of Greenland have thinned by as much as 150 meters (490 feet) since 1900. As the glaciers thinned, they laid bare the fragile mountain slopes that their ice had previously supported.",
            "And this appears to be why the ridge at Dickson Fjord collapsed, Svennevig says. It lost that icy support.",
            "He fears such disasters could become more common as Greenland and other Arctic sites warm.",
            "Since 2017, Svennevig has used satellite images to map more than 500 landslides along Greenland\u2019s coasts. Some happened thousands of years ago. Others crumbled as recently as 2021.",
            "In warmer parts of the world, heavy rains often trigger landslides. But a warming of permafrost caused many of the recent ones in Greenland. And here\u2019s how.",
            "As long as the temperature inside a mountain is no warmer than -10\u00b0 Celsius (14\u00b0 Fahrenheit), the ice within it acts as cement. It glues bits of rock together. But if the permafrost warms to around -1 \u00b0C (30 \u00b0F), that ice will change. \u201cIt actually starts to deform, like plastic or Play-Doh,\u201d Svennevig explains. Now individual rock bits no longer stick together. This can allow part of the mountainside to collapse.",
            "Indeed, at the sites of new landslides, he often sees rectangular blocks of frozen rock and gravel within the wreckage. Those house-sized icy blocks slowly thaw and crumble.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Elsewhere, melting ice has caused similar disasters.",
            "In 2016, two mountain glaciers in Tibet suddenly collapsed. Gradual warming weakened the Aru-1 and Aru-2 glaciers until their ice could no longer hold onto the mountain. The debris from this disintegration sent enough snow and ice cascading into a valley to fill 60,000 Olympic swimming pools.",
            "The ice and snow traveled up to eight kilometers (five miles) from its source. Along the way, it killed nine herders and hundreds of livestock.",
            "Melting Himalayan glaciers create a different hazard, too. Vast lakes of meltwater have formed behind huge rock piles at the ends of the glaciers. These lakes can suddenly burst out of their fragile natural dams. The resulting \u201coutburst floods\u201d can gush tens of kilometers down through any valley below, sweeping away people, homes, bridges and animals.\u00a0",
            "But landslide-tsunamis are especially worrisome because they often happen at sites with more people.",
            "In 1936, one roared through Lake Lovatnet in Norway. It swept away two villages, killing 74 people. And in 1958, a wave in Lituya Bay, Alaska, struck three large fishing vessels. One capsized and sank. One was tossed onto a hillside and destroyed. The third was tossed over a narrow strip of land and into deeper water; that boat, its captain and his 10-year-old son somehow survived.",
            "More recently, a 2017 landslide-tsunami flooded a village in western Greenland, killing four.",
            "But the risk of such an event around cruise ships that venture into fjords could prove especially catastrophic.",
            "\u201cThat is something that we definitely think a lot about,\u201d says Katherine Barnhart. She\u2019s a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. She studies landslide and tsunami risks in Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound. Much like Dickson Fjord in Greenland, steep mountains line its narrow, branching bay. And here, too, glaciers are shrinking.",
            "Detailed studies like the one Svennevig just published will help Barnhart accomplish a difficult task: building a computer program that can predict the size of a tsunami that a potential landslide might cause. \u201cBuilding up an inventory of events that have happened is really valuable,\u201d she explains.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/60T9TKuuujs?feature=oembed",
            "Authors of the new study explain how it took dozens of scientists to diagnose the source of an \u201cunusual seismic object, or USO\u201d that traveled around the globe for more than a week. Such events, they explain, can have deadly outcomes.",
            "The latest discovery leads Svennevig to worry that things could become worse. Far worse.",
            "Two years ago, one of his collaborators noticed something strange. At the time, Matthew Owen was a marine geologist at Aarhus University in Denmark. He was building sonar maps of the seafloor in Vaigat strait. It\u2019s a narrow ocean channel off western Greenland. These 3-D seafloor maps were being made to help scientists predict how future tsunamis would move through the water.",
            "As Owen assembled the maps, he noticed several large mounds on the bottom of the channel. Each covered many square kilometers. They looked like the mounds that a landslide would drop \u2014 except much bigger. Strewn along the seafloor were rectangular rocks the size of skyscrapers.",
            "\u201cSome of these individual blocks were bigger than the recent landslides\u201d that killed people, recalls Owen. (He now works at Global Maritime, a company in England that builds off-shore wind-energy farms.)",
            "When Owen showed these maps to Svennevig, they noticed something important. Each mound sat in front of a massive valley carved into the mountains above. Until then, no one had dared to think that those gouged valleys might be due to landslides. \u201cThey were just too big to comprehend,\u201d says Svennevig.",
            "Some were up to 100 times larger than the recent landslides. One had dumped up to 8.4 cubic kilometers (2 cubic miles) of rock onto the seafloor. That\u2019s enough to build 2,800 stacks of rock the size of the Empire State Building.",
            "Those landslides would have triggered enormous waves \u2014 many hundreds of meters high. Even 30 to 100 kilometers (18 to 60 miles) from where they formed, he found, waves had tossed rock and gravel as high as 70 meters (230 feet) up onto the land. At a similar distance, recent tsunamis like the one at Dickson Fjord had risen only about one-twentieth that high.",
            "These gigantic landslides likely happened at the end of the last Ice Age, some 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. That\u2019s when glaciers were retreating. And this rapid change destabilized the mountains.",
            "The Arctic\u2019s present-day warming could set the stage for a repeat of this, says Svennevig. \u201cWe should prepare for a future where these giant landslides can become a reality again.\u201d"

To do that, they\u2019d need to detect a planet\u2019s wobble in real time. Lehmann is a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. He helped devise the planetary-wobble method.",

            "The solar wind of charged particles streaming out from the sun can affect the orbits of planets, Burkert notes. And confirming that changes to satellite motions are due to black holes could be quite challenging. A tiny black hole passing close enough to Earth to be detected this way could be extremely rare, he says. Right now, he adds, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic.\u201d But he remains \u201coptimistic that it might be possible at some point.\u201d"

            "Our brains are very flexible. Some people use their brains to create art. Others use them to solve math problems. Some do both \u2014 plus a host of other actions.",
            "Our brain is made up of two halves called hemispheres. The left and right sides are symmetric, meaning they look more or less the same. The major brain structures that control how we think, move, feel and see are found in both halves.",
            "But the sides can act separately. For instance, the left side of the brain controls vision and movement on the right side of the body. And vice versa. Some functions, such as speech, can be controlled more by one side of the brain than the other. This has led some people to suggest that the two halves are specialized.",
            "People sometimes describe those of us who are more creative as being \u201cright-brained,\u201d and those who are more logical as \u201cleft-brained.\u201d This became a very popular idea about how the brain works. But it isn\u2019t really true.",

            "The theory about left and right brains emerged from work that started in the 1950s.",
            "Roger Sperry was a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He got curious about how the two sides of the brain interact. He focused on a thick bundle of nerve fibers that joins the two halves. It\u2019s called the corpus callosum and in people it contains more than 200 million nerve fibers.",

            "This connection helps the brain\u2019s two sides communicate and work together. But doctors had discovered that cutting the corpus callosum could help treat severe cases of epilepsy. In this disorder, excess nerve-cell activity can overwhelm the brain. It\u2019s been described like a lightning storm inside the head. Too much nerve-cell firing can cause harmful seizures. Cutting the corpus callosum quieted them. And it didn\u2019t seem to have a big effect on normal brain function.",
            "That splitting the brain didn\u2019t seem to cause problems fascinated Sperry. To better understand why, he started working with people who had gotten their corpus callosum cut.",
            "Sperry asked these volunteers to cover one eye at a time. Then he showed them a series of words. The people could only recall words they viewed with their right eyes, not their left. When shown objects, people could draw things they saw with their left eyes but could not describe them in words.",
            "These results suggested that the ability to use and understand language is based in the left side of the brain.",
            "This finding made sense for other reasons, too. From other studies, researchers knew about two parts of the brain important for language. They are called Broca\u2019s (BRO-kuhz) area and Wernicke\u2019s (WUR-nih-keez) area. Both are usually found on the left side of the brain.",

            "Sperry\u2019s \u201csplit-brain\u201d research changed how we thought our brain worked. Indeed, he would share the 1981 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work. But the idea of right- versus left-brain skills also caught people\u2019s imaginations. An article based on Sperry\u2019s work had been published in the New York Times Magazine in 1973. It took ideas from his findings and other case studies and ran with them. It claimed skills such as musical ability were controlled entirely by the right brain.",
            "In this way, important research gave way to speculation.",
            "In fact, this early research had one huge limitation: Scientists back then had no way to look inside a living brain.",
            "Now, researchers have several tools that can image the working brain. One is functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. It can track blood flow in the brain. Active brain cells need lots of oxygen, which is carried by blood. So high levels of blood flow are used to pinpoint regions where the brain is active.",
            "In 2013, researchers used MRI to scan the brains of more than 1,000 kids and young adults. They measured whether some brain functions seemed isolated to the left or right sides. And a few functions were tied more strongly to one side, these scans showed. Among them was language, which supported Sperry\u2019s findings from decades earlier. But most brain networks bounced between both hemispheres.",
            "That disproved the idea that only the right hemisphere is at work when you perform music or create art, says Diana Sarko. \u201cThat\u2019s just not true. [Activity] is very, very distributed.\u201d And, she adds,\u00a0\u201cThank goodness it is, because both sides of the brain have a lot to offer.\u201d Though not part of the MRI work, Sarko studies the brain at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.",

A neuroscientist, she works at the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cThe thinking now,\u201d she says, \u201cis that although\u00a0there may be one area largely responsible for some sort of skill, it doesn\u2019t work on its own.\u201d Brain imaging shows that \u201ceverything\u2019s interconnected.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Not only do brain areas work together, but sometimes networks also change or move. Such shifts may be seen in response to injury. And they give further evidence that many functions aren\u2019t limited to specific areas of the brain.",
            "Some functions are controlled more by regions on one side of the brain than the other. But traits like creativity and logic are far too complex to use just one brain area. In fact, any time you create a painting or solve a math problem, lots of areas on both sides of the brain team up. So the next time a quiz or a friend tells you that you\u2019re \u201cleft-brained\u201c or \u201cright-brained,\u201d remember: You have your whole brain to thank for all the amazing things you can do.",

            "The quantum realm is full of seemingly impossible things. But one of the strangest has to be entanglement.",
            "Entanglement is a special way of linking up particles. When two particles become entangled, their features are perfectly in sync. Such features might include their position or speed. If you measure the properties of one particle, you automatically know the properties of the other. And whatever happens to one will also affect the other.",
            "This is true no matter how far apart two entangled particles are. They could be on opposite sides of the planet, the solar system or even the universe. Even then, observing one would still instantly tell you what\u2019s going on with the other.",
            "Scientists first proposed entanglement was possible in the 1930s. But not everyone was on board with the idea. One famous skeptic was Albert Einstein. His problem was that with entangled particles, it would be possible to instantly tell someone what\u2019s happening infinitely far away. This would suggest that information can travel infinitely fast. And nothing, not even information, is supposed to be able to travel faster than the speed of light. For that reason, Einstein dubbed the idea of entanglement \u201cspooky action at a distance.\u201d",
            "Lab experiments have since shown that particles can indeed become entangled. Those experiments won three researchers the 2022 Nobel Prize in physics.

That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",
            "But it\u2019s difficult to study how materials behave under the extreme conditions required for fusion. And that\u2019s where the mayonnaise comes in.",
            "The behavior of the fuel capsule in fusion experiments, it turns out, has a lot in common with mayonnaise. The fuel capsule is a metal or other material that contains a gas (the fuel). When lasers hit the capsule, it melts. The melty capsule can now switch from elastic to plastic.",
            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Two mechanical engineers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., wanted to understand that better. So they looked at how mayo mixes with a gas \u2014 air. Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",
            "The scientists observed the glob while the wheel was spinning. They looked at it again after it stopped. They checked whether the mayo had returned to its original form, changed shape or broken apart. This determined the border between its elastic and plastic behaviors, they explain in the May Physical Review E.",
            "Working with mayo does have one drawback. When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"

            "Dandruff flakes on your hair or shoulders don\u2019t look good. The itchy scalp that comes with it is no fun, either. In fact, although dandruff shows up on your hair, the condition actually starts with your scalp.",

Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",

Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",

She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",

            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",

            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",

This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
