            "Here, Casey Harrell reacts to using a computer-linked implant to \u201cspeak\u201d for the first time since becoming paralyzed.",
            "A few years ago, Casey Harrell was diagnosed with a devastating brain disease. Known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, it left him paralyzed and unable to speak. But last year, a doctor implanted tiny electrodes in the speech center of Harrell\u2019s brain. They pick up brainwaves that a computer can convert into words. Today, the 46-year-old man can once again converse.",
            "Using recordings of his voice from before his disease, scientists were able to train an artificial intelligence model. With its help, Harrell now \u201cspeaks\u201d through an electronic voice synthesizer. And thanks to that AI, it sounds similar to the natural voice he once had.",
            "\u201cOne of the things that people with my disease suffer from is isolation and depression,\u201d Harrell says, using the new technology. These individuals don\u2019t feel like they matter anymore, he says. But thanks to this tech, he and others like him might be able to actively participate in society again.",
            "This new technology offers \u201cby far the most accurate speech-decoding ever described,\u201d says David Brandman. He\u2019s the neurosurgeon with the University of California, Davis Health who implanted the devices in Harrell\u2019s brain. His team shared details of how the tech works in the August 14 New England Journal of Medicine.",
            "This technology isn\u2019t a mind reader, Brandman emphasizes. It can\u2019t listen to someone\u2019s secret thoughts. It only works when the user wants it to \u2014 when they are trying to speak.",
            "\u201cThere are \u2026 thousands of people in the U.S. right now who want to talk, but can\u2019t,\u201d says Brandman. \u201cThey are trapped in their own bodies.\u201d",
            "One day, this technology might help many of them get their voice back.",
            "Electrical signals from the brain travel along neurons to control every movement in the body. Different parts of the brain turn on each time you wave your hand, run or smile. Those electrical signals travel down pathways to activate the muscles you want to use.",
            "But injury or disease can damage parts of those neural pathways. This can keep the electrical signals from reaching the muscles needed to move or speak.",
            "Sergey Stavisky is a neuroscientist at UC Davis. Together, he and Brandman run a neuroprosthetics lab to restore abilities people have lost due to brain injury and disease. Since 2021, their team has been working to restore speech through technology known as brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs.",
            "BCIs use implants to tap into brain signals. A computer learns to interpret what the brain signals mean. Later, it can translate those signals into machine motion. It\u2019s how a person can control a robotic arm using their thoughts.",
            "Their work is part of a long-running study known as BrainGate. It tests how safe the implants are in people who have become paralyzed. It also works to improve such devices so that they can help people regain better control of their environment.",

            "In July 2023, Brandman surgically placed four tiny devices into the part of Harrell\u2019s brain that controls speech. Each device has 64 metal prongs that help it detect electrical signals being relayed by neurons in his brain.",

            "On paper, a recording of those signals looks like a series of waves.\u00a0",
            "After Harrell recovered from surgery, the researchers visited him at home. They attached a recording device to his head and turned on their BCI. It took the system a few minutes to learn how to decode Harrell\u2019s brain signals as he tried to speak. Then, it began turning those brain signals into words.",
            "As we speak, our brain breaks down each word into small bites of sound. Each sound bite is known as a phoneme (FO-neem). For example, moose is made from three different sound bites: the \u201cm,\u201d the \u201coo\u201d and the \u201css.\u201d",
            "Each phoneme produces a unique electrical signal in the brain. It\u2019s like a fingerprint. Math can tell the technology how to turn those signals into the actual words someone was trying to say. Then words appear as sentences on a computer screen and are \u201cspoken\u201d out loud by a computer\u2019s speaker.",

            "fCThis image maps brainwaves emitted by neurons. Those waves correspond to electrical signals in the brain. Here, the map shows how the waves differ when Casey Harrell was thinking the words \u201cnewspaper\u201d and \u201cdelivery.\u201d",
            "On the second day of using the system, Harrell was able to speak with his young daughter for the first time that she could remember.",
            "Until he used the new system, Harrell needed the assistance of a trained interpreter to communicate what he wanted to say. But that was difficult. He could only get across about six words per minute correctly, says Brandman. For context: The average person speaks about 120 to 150 words per minute.",
            "Harrell can now have conversations using the technology to share his thoughts, needs and wants. He also can show his sense of humor. Today, he uses the tech up to 12 hours a day to talk with family, friends and coworkers. Harrell still works as a climate activist.",

            "Other scientists have implanted similar devices into someone\u2019s brain before. But those devices had half as many prongs to pick up brain signals. In tests, such implants proved accurate for three out of every four words, on average. Getting one fourth of all words wrong made communicating hard, says Brandman. Still, it did show the idea could work. \u00a0\u00a0",
            "A post shared by UC Davis Health (@ucdavishealth)",
            "Brandman and Stavisky now use implants with twice as many prongs. More prongs means their devices can better \u201chear\u201d nerve signals. The researchers also improved the math used by their BCI. Together these changes boosted the accuracy of its speech decoding.",
            "Over 32 weeks, this tech correctly interpreted what Harrell wanted to say about 97 percent of the time. That means it got 49 out of every 50 words right, Brandman explains. And its accuracy is still improving.",
            "Other research groups are also working on computerized devices to decode people\u2019s brain signals into speech.\u00a0",
            "Chris Crawford is a computer scientist at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. He directs its Human-Technology Interaction Lab. There, he creates computer programs to run wearable BCIs. People who are paralyzed by disease and injury \u201clive with these impairments every day,\u201d he says. That\u2019s why these systems are so important, he says. They can potentially help people regain functions they once thought were forever lost.\u00a0",
            "Like Crawford, Roya Salehzadeh did not work on the BrainGate technology. But she says research like this could help engineers such as herself. At Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Mich., she works on BCIs and human-robot interactions. BCIs, she says, could help someone drive their wheelchair, just by using information that comes from their brain. Or, she notes, BCIs could detect emotions or stress in people who can\u2019t communicate.",
            "How long until these systems become widely available? Brandman thinks doctors may be able to prescribe a BCI like the one Harrell uses within the next five to 10 years.",

For example, when working on a project you enjoy \u2014 such as drawing or solving a puzzle \u2014 your brain releases dopamine. And this motivates you to keep going. This chemical focuses our attention on the current task and helps us organize our thoughts. It even plays a role in how we plan the steps we must take to finish a job.",
            "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter. That\u2019s a type of chemical that carries messages between neurons in the brain. A tiny gap separates each neuron, or nerve cell, from the next. This gap is called a synapse. And neurotransmitters like dopamine can cross this gap. That\u2019s how they transmit a signal from one nerve cell to another.",

Doctors can treat ADHD with medications that increase the brain\u2019s dopamine level. However, doctors must prescribe these medications carefully and in low doses, as too much can cause problems.",
            "Some illicit drugs can cause the brain to release too much dopamine. Activities such as eating junk food and playing video games can also cause this problem in some people. And this can lead people to do more and more of the activity that causes the brain to release this feel-good chemical. If a person begins to neglect school, friends or other important parts of their life to carry out a dopamine-triggering activity, addiction may develop.",

That\u2019s why some diseases involving low dopamine affect people\u2019s ability to move. Parkinson\u2019s disease is one example. Scientists have linked this disease to a loss of cells in the brain that release dopamine. With this understanding, they can work on finding ways to replace the dopamine loss and help people manage their symptoms.",

And the electricity that powers it not only spews climate-warming gases but also raises energy bills. In tackling this challenge, two research teams have looked to the past. They\u2019re combining some classic cooling concepts with new ideas. Their designs suggest how coming generations might build homes that deal with heat without being too costly.",
            "One of these groups is at Columbia University in New York City. This team has designed walls that aren\u2019t flat but zigzagged. They can be attached to the outside of regular walls. The new siding looks a bit like those accordion-pleated shades for windows. One half of each pleat faces up; the other half points down.",

It might be brick, stone or adobe. Vents and other openings in the building\u2019s structure allow air to flow through it naturally. The flowing air evenly mixes warm, buoyant air with dense, cooler air. This natural ventilation draws in plenty of outdoor air to keep indoor rooms from getting stale.",

Teitelbaum, a thermal engineer at AIL Research in Hopewell, N.J., did not take part in either project.

            "In summer, he notes, the ground often is much hotter than the air. For instance, where the ground might be about 60\u00ba Celsius (140\u00ba Fahrenheit), a building\u2019s walls might only be about 30 \u00baC (86 \u00baF). Straight walls might reflect some solar energy up to the sky, Cheng says. But at the same time, they could be picking up heat from the ground, explains this mechanical engineer (who\u2019s recently moved to Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.).",

The researchers glued a thin, highly reflective sheet of Mylar, a plastic film, onto the downward-facing side of each pleat.",

            "The temperature of the pleated-wall siding varied across the day. But on average, it was cooler than the flat wall by 2.3 \u00baC (4.1 \u00baF). At its best, it was 3.1 \u00baC (5.6 \u00baF) cooler than the flat wall. A cooler wall means less heat was transferred through the wall to warm the interior.

            "Then they placed four water bottles inside each model. Water absorbs and releases heat well. So these bottles acted as the thermal mass for the structures. Like the thick walls of ancient buildings, this mass absorbs indoor heat. Each model was then left for two days at a sunny desert site in Topanga, Calif. Sensors measured indoor heat and air flow in and out of each \u201chome.\u201d",
            "The new design stayed, on average, 1.6 \u00baC (2.9 \u00baF) cooler inside than the outside air. In contrast, the standard design was 4.3 \u00baC (7.7 \u00baF) warmer, on average, than the air outside.",
            "These results were good, but indoor temperatures kept going up and down, like a roller coaster. They varied by up to 6.8 \u00baC (12 \u00baF) over the day.",
            "To fix that, the team added two more water bottles to each home. This greater thermal mass helped indoor temps remain more stable. And the test home now drew in twice as much fresh air and expelled twice as much stale air as before.",
            "The average indoor temp was now 3.9 \u00baC (7.0 \u00baF) cooler than outside. It was 8.9 \u00baC (16 \u00baF) cooler than air in the standard-home model!",

            "And the latter one should be easier to maintain than a home with A/C, adds Purdue mechanical engineer Yun Zhang. She says \u201cshould\u201d because a move-in-ready model doesn\u2019t exist yet. A \u201ctest home\u201d does \u2014 but it\u2019s only the size of a carry-on suitcase.",
            "Zhang would also like to see studies to learn how dwellers might like them. Until someone tries to live in a full-size structure, she explains, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s comfortable.\u201d",
            "The Columbia team developed a new \u201call-season\u201d design to make its house more effective and comfortable year-round. The angles of pleats on its zigzag siding can be varied, depending on the season. They could be adjusted to maximize cooling in summer and warming in winter.",
            "Cheng\u2019s group described this innovation in the May 15 Cell Reports Physical Science. Similarly, Craig\u2019s team is working on a roof with adjustable thermal mass.",

            "A mountainside in Greenland collapsed catastrophically into the ocean, last year. The landslide triggered a wave as tall as the Statue of Liberty. This wave \u2014 a tsunami \u2014 swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down a fjord there. Its rapid and violent motion ripped up the coastline. And its vibrations were so violent that they were detected worldwide.",
            "Indeed, they rang the planet like a seismic bell every minute and a half \u2014 for nine straight days.",
            "The good news: No one was hurt. Large tourist ships ventured into that same fjord on the days before and after the tsunami. They were ferrying people on and off a beach with small boats, according to Kristian Svennevig.",
            "\u201cIt was pure luck that no one was there when it happened,\u201d he says. The powerful wave would have easily capsized the small boats and swept the people away.",
            "Svennevig is a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). He\u2019s based in Copenhagen, Denmark. He led a team that investigated the event. They now believe that Earth\u2019s warming climate set off the massive landslide that started it all. They described their findings September 13 in Science.",
            "Aside from those caused by earthquakes and volcanoes, \u201cmost landslides around the world you can tie to climatic factors,\u201d says Svennevig. And as Earth keeps warming, he worries, this dangerous event could be a warning of worse things to come.",
            "Saturday, September 16, 2023, started normally enough. But then at 11:35 a.m., sensors in Asia and North America picked up a sharp seismic signal. They detected waves rippling from a remote part of Greenland\u2019s east coast.",
            "Earthquakes typically cause such vibrations. But explosions, tsunamis and volcanoes can, too. Initially, the source here was unknown.",
            "The next day, tourists on a cruise ship noticed damage to an abandoned research station on east Greenland\u2019s Ella Island. Equipment that was stored on land, including a boat and a truck-size shipping container, had been washed into the sea.",
            "Svennevig heard these reports when he arrived at work Monday morning. Suspecting a tsunami, he looked through recent satellite images of the area. He hoped they would offer clues.",
            "And they did.",
            "For many kilometers along Dickson Fjord, vegetation had been erased from the shorelines. At Ella Island, the plants had vanished to heights as much as four meters (13 feet) above the water. Further west and inland, plants were missing to higher and higher coastal elevations.",
            "A huge wave must have come from the west, Svennevig realized. It would have started out tall and gradually shrunk as it rolled east.",
            "That afternoon, he and several colleagues homed in on its source.",

            "Two satellite photos taken September 15 and 17 showed that a small mountain ridge near the west end of the fjord had vanished.",
            "A frozen glacier had long sat at the foot of this ridge, some 72 kilometers (45 miles) from Ella Island. Somehow, the lower reaches of that glacier had been pulverized.",
            "The collapsed ridge had smashed down onto the glacier below. It released some 25 million cubic meters (880 million cubic feet) of rock and shattered ice. The volume of this debris was equal to 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This rock and ice tumbled off the end of the glacier and into the fjord\u2019s water.",
            "*a_composite_image_showing_a_mountain_ridge_and_the_glacier_topping_it_before_and_after_the_tsunami",
            "fCA mountain ridge overlooking this glacier in Greenland collapsed into a massive landslide. The tsunami it triggered swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down the fjord. Climate warming set off the disaster by causing the glacier to thin, which destabilized the mountain ridge that it had supported.",
            "The resulting splash threw water 200 meters (650 feet) up the nearby mountain slopes. The wave it triggered was 110 meters (360 feet) tall. It may have sped along the fjord at 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour or more!",
            "But there wasn\u2019t just a single wave.",
            "This explosive event provoked a repeating wave called a seiche (SAYSH). It resembled the back-and-forth sloshing of water in a bathtub. Except here it was way bigger \u2014 echoing through the fjord every 90 seconds for nine straight days.",
            "Though sudden, this catastrophe was caused by changes that have been slowly happening for decades. Earth\u2019s warming climate has shrunk the glacier by Dickson Fjord over time. No one knows how quickly it was losing ice. But other glaciers in this part of Greenland have thinned by as much as 150 meters (490 feet) since 1900. As the glaciers thinned, they laid bare the fragile mountain slopes that their ice had previously supported.",
            "And this appears to be why the ridge at Dickson Fjord collapsed, Svennevig says. It lost that icy support.",
            "He fears such disasters could become more common as Greenland and other Arctic sites warm.",
            "Since 2017, Svennevig has used satellite images to map more than 500 landslides along Greenland\u2019s coasts. Some happened thousands of years ago. Others crumbled as recently as 2021.",
            "In warmer parts of the world, heavy rains often trigger landslides. But a warming of permafrost caused many of the recent ones in Greenland. And here\u2019s how.",
            "As long as the temperature inside a mountain is no warmer than -10\u00b0 Celsius (14\u00b0 Fahrenheit), the ice within it acts as cement. It glues bits of rock together. But if the permafrost warms to around -1 \u00b0C (30 \u00b0F), that ice will change. \u201cIt actually starts to deform, like plastic or Play-Doh,\u201d Svennevig explains. Now individual rock bits no longer stick together. This can allow part of the mountainside to collapse.",
            "Indeed, at the sites of new landslides, he often sees rectangular blocks of frozen rock and gravel within the wreckage. Those house-sized icy blocks slowly thaw and crumble.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Elsewhere, melting ice has caused similar disasters.",
            "In 2016, two mountain glaciers in Tibet suddenly collapsed. Gradual warming weakened the Aru-1 and Aru-2 glaciers until their ice could no longer hold onto the mountain. The debris from this disintegration sent enough snow and ice cascading into a valley to fill 60,000 Olympic swimming pools.",
            "The ice and snow traveled up to eight kilometers (five miles) from its source. Along the way, it killed nine herders and hundreds of livestock.",
            "Melting Himalayan glaciers create a different hazard, too. Vast lakes of meltwater have formed behind huge rock piles at the ends of the glaciers. These lakes can suddenly burst out of their fragile natural dams. The resulting \u201coutburst floods\u201d can gush tens of kilometers down through any valley below, sweeping away people, homes, bridges and animals.\u00a0",
            "But landslide-tsunamis are especially worrisome because they often happen at sites with more people.",
            "In 1936, one roared through Lake Lovatnet in Norway. It swept away two villages, killing 74 people. And in 1958, a wave in Lituya Bay, Alaska, struck three large fishing vessels. One capsized and sank. One was tossed onto a hillside and destroyed. The third was tossed over a narrow strip of land and into deeper water; that boat, its captain and his 10-year-old son somehow survived.",
            "More recently, a 2017 landslide-tsunami flooded a village in western Greenland, killing four.",
            "But the risk of such an event around cruise ships that venture into fjords could prove especially catastrophic.",
            "\u201cThat is something that we definitely think a lot about,\u201d says Katherine Barnhart. She\u2019s a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. She studies landslide and tsunami risks in Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound. Much like Dickson Fjord in Greenland, steep mountains line its narrow, branching bay. And here, too, glaciers are shrinking.",
            "Detailed studies like the one Svennevig just published will help Barnhart accomplish a difficult task: building a computer program that can predict the size of a tsunami that a potential landslide might cause. \u201cBuilding up an inventory of events that have happened is really valuable,\u201d she explains.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/60T9TKuuujs?feature=oembed",
            "Authors of the new study explain how it took dozens of scientists to diagnose the source of an \u201cunusual seismic object, or USO\u201d that traveled around the globe for more than a week. Such events, they explain, can have deadly outcomes.",
            "The latest discovery leads Svennevig to worry that things could become worse. Far worse.",
            "Two years ago, one of his collaborators noticed something strange. At the time, Matthew Owen was a marine geologist at Aarhus University in Denmark. He was building sonar maps of the seafloor in Vaigat strait. It\u2019s a narrow ocean channel off western Greenland. These 3-D seafloor maps were being made to help scientists predict how future tsunamis would move through the water.",
            "As Owen assembled the maps, he noticed several large mounds on the bottom of the channel. Each covered many square kilometers. They looked like the mounds that a landslide would drop \u2014 except much bigger. Strewn along the seafloor were rectangular rocks the size of skyscrapers.",
            "\u201cSome of these individual blocks were bigger than the recent landslides\u201d that killed people, recalls Owen. (He now works at Global Maritime, a company in England that builds off-shore wind-energy farms.)",
            "When Owen showed these maps to Svennevig, they noticed something important. Each mound sat in front of a massive valley carved into the mountains above. Until then, no one had dared to think that those gouged valleys might be due to landslides. \u201cThey were just too big to comprehend,\u201d says Svennevig.",
            "Some were up to 100 times larger than the recent landslides. One had dumped up to 8.4 cubic kilometers (2 cubic miles) of rock onto the seafloor. That\u2019s enough to build 2,800 stacks of rock the size of the Empire State Building.",
            "Those landslides would have triggered enormous waves \u2014 many hundreds of meters high. Even 30 to 100 kilometers (18 to 60 miles) from where they formed, he found, waves had tossed rock and gravel as high as 70 meters (230 feet) up onto the land. At a similar distance, recent tsunamis like the one at Dickson Fjord had risen only about one-twentieth that high.",
            "These gigantic landslides likely happened at the end of the last Ice Age, some 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. That\u2019s when glaciers were retreating. And this rapid change destabilized the mountains.",
            "The Arctic\u2019s present-day warming could set the stage for a repeat of this, says Svennevig. \u201cWe should prepare for a future where these giant landslides can become a reality again.\u201d"

It was the explosion of a star, or a supernova.",

If it gets bigger than about 1.4 times the mass of the sun, the white dwarf becomes unstable and goes supernova, completely destroying the star.",
            "With the other type of supernova, a star several times bigger than the sun runs out of fuel to burn. When the star blows up, it throws off its outer layers into space and its core collapses. Stars that are a bit bigger than the sun collapse into neutron stars. Stars that are much bigger than the sun collapse into black holes.",
            "The supernova that astronomers saw in 1054 A.D. was the explosion of a star about 10 times the mass of our sun. It threw off a bunch of material that now makes up the famous Crab Nebula.

            "When you turn on a faucet, water flows one way: out into the sink, then down the drain. That one-way flow is important. If the flow reversed, clean water might become dirtied by germs or other contaminants. But keeping the flow moving one direction isn\u2019t always easy; it often requires valves that can break. Researchers have now developed pipes that keep liquids moving one way \u2014 and they\u2019re valve-free.",

            "The team published its findings September 24 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
            "Unlike ours, shark intestines have a hidden internal corkscrew shape, or helix. That helix coils around and around. And a 2021 study found that it holds the key to one-way flow of partly digested food through a shark\u2019s intestines.",
            "\u201cI wanted to know if the effect occurred only in sharks,\u201d says Sarah Keller. A chemist, she works at the University of Washington in Seattle. Keller suspected it might also occur \u201cin squishy \u2026 tubes that mimicked the biological system.\u201d To find out, she teamed up with two colleagues at Washington: physicist Ido Levin and materials chemist Alshakim Nelson. Working with scientists who have different backgrounds is \u201cthe best way to make discoveries in the lab,\u201d she explains.",
            "Her team started by 3-D printing short, rigid tubes using a material called resin. These didn\u2019t bend or flex. Each tube had a different shaped helix inside. Imagine Slinky toys that were more or less stretched out and had wires with different widths.",
            "The team varied how much of the inside of each tube a helix covered. Some helices were skinny and left a large opening in the middle. Others seemed to fill the entire tube when you peered through one end. The researchers also varied the angle of the helix. Sometimes it was nearly perpendicular to the tube wall. Other times it was slanted sharply downward from the tube\u2019s wall.",

            "To test which helices worked best to control flow, the researchers hooked up the tubes to flowing water. Then they measured the rate of flow coming out the end of the pipe. In half of the tests, the tubes were attached with the helix pointing down, just like a spiral slide. This is the way a shark\u2019s intestine is oriented. The other times, this helix pointed up, like an upside-down slide.",
            "When the helix pointed down, water flowed two to three times faster than when it had been pointed upward. The helix had therefore helped keep water flowing in one direction. Effects didn\u2019t seem to change with the various angles and coils of the helices; most of these worked pretty well.",

            "The researchers 3-D printed a set of tubes that could flex as a fluid moved through them. It\u2019s like how your body might bend when you stand in a stream or current, Keller notes.",
            "Her team again compared the flow of water when the helix was pointing down versus when it was pointing up. Once more, pointing down proved faster \u2014 a whopping 15 times faster than in the other direction, Levin says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big effect!\u201d",
            "\u201cWater pushes on the deformable pipe, bending parts of it,\u201d Keller notes. This \u201cin turn changes the flow of the water.\u201d Her team doesn\u2019t yet know why bending the pipe sped up the flow. But they\u2019re excited to figure that out.",
            "Such helical pipes might one day be used for a variety of applications. \u201cMost valves have moving parts that open and close\u201d to prevent backward flow, Nelson says. \u201cThese valves can wear out over time and must be replaced.\u201d Helical tubes could replace valves in hard-to-reach locations, he says. Those might be in drainage systems or air-flow systems where one-way flow is essential.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s super exciting that studying these everyday things [like shark guts] can lead to big scientific breakthroughs,\u201d Levin says. \u201cI love that my next big idea for a science project might come from just hanging out in my backyard and noticing something new.

            "Sonic isn\u2019t your typical hedgehog. He boasts incredible superspeed that lets him launch off springs, sprint over water and even clear loop-de-loops. In the Sonic the Hedgehog games, our favorite blue hedgehog runs through these loops to complete levels. If he enters one too slowly, though, he risks falling off the track. \u00a0Animals \u2014 including hedgehogs \u2014 don\u2019t typically run through loops. Instead, climbing creatures rely on specialized limbs to scale vertical surfaces. That leaves few role models in the animal kingdom for Sonic\u2019s upside-down antics. But roller-coaster carts, race cars and even advanced parkour runners can clear loops.\u00a0",
            "\u200b\u200b\u200bSonic could take advantage of the same physics for his stunts, says \u200b\u200bPaolo Segre. He studies biomechanics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay. The key to clearing a large loop is \u201cspeed, speed, speed,\u201d Segre says. \u201cThat\u2019s all that really matters \u2014 and some decent shoes.\u201d \u00a0",
            "As Sonic approaches the top of the loop, two downward forces act on him: gravity and the \u201cnormal force\u201d exerted by the track. Together, these forces create a centripetal force that keeps Sonic on his circular path through the loop. Sonic\u2019s inertia, which is his resistance to a change in motion, helps him maintain his high speed as he moves through the loop. That allows him to clear the top without falling off the track.\u00a0",
            "Like a roller-coaster car, Sonic needs to reach a minimum speed to do this. But that speed would barely be a light jog for such a fast hedgehog, says Segre. Sonic can sustain speeds of some 1,200 kilometers (760 miles) per hour. That\u2019s about the speed of sound. \u00a0",

At the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, Hassanalian designs robots inspired by animals. A lack of natural loops means most animals haven\u2019t evolved to run through these obstacles, he says. Instead, animals such as insects and geckos use specialized limbs to climb vertical surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Many insects run up surfaces using tiny claws and hairs on their legs that grip little pits and cracks. Geckos have thousands of tiny fibers under their feet that bond with a surface\u2019s molecules. Called van der Waals forces, these weak bonds are easily broken when the gecko lifts its foot.\u00a0\u00a0Sonic\u2019s hair may also help him clear loops \u2014 but not by gripping the track. Hedgehog quills are actually hardened, modified hairs. In the real world, these needle-like hairs protect hedgehogs from predators. Sonic\u2019s quills, though, may make him more aerodynamic, notes Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0Speedy animals such as cheetahs and horses need to reduce drag, or resistance to their motion caused by moving through air. An object\u2019s shape determines how much drag it experiences. Sonic\u2019s quills might reduce drag on his body by preventing large vortices, or whirls of air, from whipping up around him. The quills\u2019 jagged edges could cut these whirls into smaller vortices less likely to disturb airflow, says Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0He likens it to the vortex generators found on a race car. As a car speeds along, air passes along its surface. If this flow drifts away from the car, it can make the airflow turbulent, resulting in increased drag. Vortex generators are fins on a car that create small vortices, which redirect air back toward the car\u2019s surface. That helps stabilize the car at high speeds. \u00a0",

            "The physics behind race cars don\u2019t just apply to Sonic. Birds also take cues from racing to scale vertical surfaces. Most birds tackle tricky inclines using wing-assisted incline running, says Segre. \u200b\u200bWhen running up a slope, two-legged animals angle their bodies parallel to the surface. But this makes it hard to maintain the proper grip needed for climbing.\u00a0\u00a0So what can birds do? Flap their wings. \u201cThe wingbeats push them into the ground, kind of like the spoiler on a race car,\u201d says Segre. Like vortex generators, a spoiler is a device that affects how air flows over a vehicle. This disrupted airflow helps create a downward force that presses race cars into the ground, improving grip, or traction, between the tires and the road.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cOnce [birds] have that traction, they can actually use their legs to run,\u201d Segre says. This lets birds navigate different terrain, forage for food and escape predators. \u201cWe especially see it in baby birds who are not yet good at flying.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In experiments, this clever trick even let birds run up inverted walls \u2014 surfaces that slant toward the climber as they rise. No other two-legged animal manages this feat. \u201cWe see tons of climbing animals that are [four-legged],\u201d says Segre. This is because four-legged animals can \u201ckeep their body right up against the wall like a rock climber.\u201d By keeping their center of gravity close to the surface, they\u2019re less likely to tip over backward. Wing-assisted incline running helps birds hug similarly close to steep surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0Still, even wing-assisted birds aren\u2019t able to run upside down like Sonic. And their tactic for scaling inclines isn\u2019t what Segre would expect for our blue hero. While birds mostly use their legs to ascend, their wings are essential to getting enough traction. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really what Sonic does,\u201d says Segre. \u201cHe just uses pure speed.\u201d \u00a0",

She works at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.",
            "Nicknamed Percy, the rover turned up this potential sign of life in mid-July. The robot had drilled into a reddish rock at a site known as Cheyava Falls. (It was named for a feature at the Grand Canyon.) This is the first piece of Mars that Percy found containing organic molecules. Here, the term organic refers to carbon-based molecules. On Earth, they\u2019re the building blocks of life.",

            "This isn\u2019t the first sign of organics on Mars. The\u00a0Curiosity rover detected organic molecules\u00a0in 2014. It had been examining rocks at a site called Gale Crater. But since Percy\u00a0landed in Jezero Crater three years ago, scientists have struggled to identify organics, Stack Morgan says. That landing site was an ancient, dried-up lake.",
            "Adding to the new excitement, little white spots with black rims speckle the reddish rock sample that Percy found. \u201cThey look like a tricolored leopard spot,\u201d Stack Morgan says.",
            "Percy examined these spots using instruments that can identify the chemical recipe of materials. And the spots\u2019 rims contained iron phosphate. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry have been linked to ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create such rings can be an energy source for microbes.",

            "But other features of the sampled rock seem to muddy the picture of how it likely formed. For instance, Stack Morgan notes, it\u2019s shot through with white veins of calcium sulfate. And those veins are filled with super-tiny crystals of olivine. It\u2019s a mineral that forms from a volcano\u2019s magma.",
            "Finding the spots and these volcanic features in the same rock is \u201ca little bit mysterious,\u201d Stack Morgan says. They seem to point to different origins, she says.

In that case, he notes, \u201cAll this is, is an interesting example of water-rock chemistry.\u201d",

A big part of Percy\u2019s mission is to collect samples from interesting rocks for a future spacecraft to later bring home to Earth. Once here, they can be studied with better tools than a rover can carry on its back. For now, Stack Morgan says, Percy has thrown everything it has at this rock.",
            "When might the rocks be brought to Earth? No one knows. Funding is currently on hold for a program known as Mars Sample Return, or MSR. \u201cWith this sample, the rationale for MSR is strengthened,\u201d Byrne says.

The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",

But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise.

Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",

It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",

And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",

Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "If you have ever made homemade ice cream the old-fashioned way using a hand-crank machine, you probably know that you need ice and rock salt to make the cream mixture cold enough to freeze. Similarly, if you live in a cold climate, you may have seen the trucks that salt and sand the streets after a snowfall to prevent ice from building up on the roads. In both of these instances, salt is acting to lower the\u00a0freezing point\u00a0of water and changing what\u00a0phase of matter\u00a0the water is (i.e., turning solid ice into liquid water).",
            "For the ice cream maker, because the rock salt lowers the freezing point of the ice, the temperature of the ice/rock salt mixture can drop below the normal freezing point of water. This makes it possible to freeze the ice cream mixture in the inner container of the ice cream machine. For the salt spread on streets in wintertime, the lowered freezing point means that snow and ice can melt even when the weather is below the normal freezing point of water. Both the ice cream maker and road salt are examples of\u00a0freezing point depression.",
            "Table salt (sodium chloride, or NaCl) mixed with water is an example of a chemical solution. In a\u00a0solution, there is a\u00a0solvent\u00a0(the water in this example) and a\u00a0solute\u00a0(the salt in this example). A\u00a0molecule\u00a0of the solute dissolves (goes into solution) because the force of attraction between the solute molecule and the solvent molecules is greater than the force of attraction between the molecules of the solute. Water (H2O) is a good solvent because it is partially\u00a0polarized. (This polarization is caused by the distribution of\u00a0electrons\u00a0in the water molecule. Specifically, its hydrogen ends have a partial\u00a0positive charge, and the oxygen end has a partial\u00a0negative charge.)",
            "Because water molecules are partially polarized, it is possible for them to arrange themselves around\u00a0ions\u00a0(which are molecules or\u00a0atoms\u00a0that have a charge), like the sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl\u2013) ions that make up table salt. This is why there is a greater attraction between the water molecules and the molecules of salt than there is between the molecules of salt by themselves, and why the water can dissolve the salt to create a salty solution.",
            "Other substances when mixed with water can also lower its freezing point. The amount by which the freezing point is lowered depends only on the number of molecules dissolved, not on their chemical nature. This is an example of a\u00a0colligative property.",

            "When Santa Claus takes off on Christmas Eve, he won\u2019t be doing it in secret. Millions of children around the world will be waiting. And the North American Aerospace Defense Command (or NORAD) will be watching too. This military organization will be sending information to a Santa tracker, where waiting kids (and parents) can follow Santa via phone call, text or an app. But it\u2019s no easy task to keep track of this jolly old elf. In fact, it requires a bit of science.",
            "NORAD\u2019s main duty isn\u2019t actually to track Santa, explains Major Cameron Hillier. His job in public affairs is to talk to journalists and other people about NORAD. NORAD is not Santa, he stresses. It\u2019s a military organization shared between the United States and Canada, located in Colorado Springs, Colo. NORAD\u2019s goal is to watch for and detect any objects coming into the air and ocean spaces near the two countries. People at NORAD then determine whether a new object is a threat \u2014 or if it\u2019s just a magical old man with a load of presents.",
            "NORAD\u2019s Santa duties started with a mix-up in 1955. That year, the store Sears sent out a catalogue to customers advertising what they sold. In the back was an ad with a phone number to call Santa.",
            "\u201cThe only problem [was] the number they put in was not for Santa,\u201d Hillier explains. \u201dIt was for the Continental Air Defense Command operation center.\u201d That was the organization that existed before NORAD. At the time, the United States was afraid that the Soviet Union \u2014 the nation that broke up into Russia and other countries in the last part of the 20th century \u2014 would attack, leading to nuclear war. A man named Colonel Shoup was on duty Christmas Eve, Hillier says. He was supposed to be watching for any sign the Soviet Union might attack. Instead, \u201che was inundated with calls from kids trying to talk to Santa.\u201d",
            "Luckily, Colonel Shoup figured out what was going on. \u201cHe was quick enough to put two and two together and in response to a kid said that Air Defense Command would watch Santa\u2019s process,\u201d Hillier says. And the organization continued year after year to answer calls and tell kids where Santa was on Christmas. NORAD picked up the Santa tracking duties when the Continental Air Defense Command became part of NORAD in 1958.",

            "Now, NORAD relies on a small army of volunteers to take phone calls asking for Santa\u2019s location. \u201cI\u2019ve been taking calls from kids at the call center,\u201d Hillier says. \u201cWe have 1,500 volunteers to support the call center in two-hour rotations.\u201d NORAD also has a website and an app. This may have been going on for decades, but Hillier says it never gets old. \u201cYou\u2019re just infused with the Christmas spirit.\u201d",
            "The yearly reindeer tracking begins with a series of radar systems called the North Warning System. The radar stations are set up across the very north of Canada and Alaska. They send out radio waves that bounce back when they hit an object. That allows the radar to determine when there is something flying through their range \u2014 such as a large man in a red suit on a sleigh.",
            "Those radar systems are the first to detect when Santa takes off from the North Pole. But their maximum range is only 370 to 460 kilometers (230 to 290 miles). They can\u2019t pick up when Santa gets to the beginning of his route \u2014 the International Date Line. \u201cHe likes to show up around midnight,\u201d Hillier says. \u201cStarting there and working west, he\u2019s chasing twilight, looking to hit each boy\u2019s and girl\u2019s home at the appropriate time.\u201d",
            "This is when satellites take over. NORAD relies on many satellites in orbit around the Earth. They detect infrared \u2014 a wavelength of light that indicates temperature. Normally, the satellites would sense heat off something like an incoming rocket. But on Christmas Eve, Hillier says, \u201cwe are much more light-hearted.\u201d Then, the satellites track a different heat source \u2014 Rudolph\u2019s nose. \u201cBeing so bright, it offers a heat signature that we can track.\u201d",
            "The satellites track Santa\u2019s journey over Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe. Once Santa arrives over eastern Canada, though, he picks up an honor guard of fighter jets. \u201cWe have fighters from the Royal Canadian Air Force that greet and escort Santa through Canadian airspace,\u201d says Hillier. At the border, Santa is handed off to the U.S. National Guard.",
            "It\u2019s just good manners, he says. No one bothers St. Nick on his rounds. \u201cTracking Santa is routine,\u201d Hillier notes. \u201cThere\u2019s establishment of presence. If you know he\u2019s coming and he\u2019s knows you\u2019re coming, there\u2019s a level of professionalism that allows for an unspoken agreement.\u201d",
            "It\u2019s always good to let the military know you\u2019re coming, though. If Santa needs to communicate, Hillier says, \u201cwe have agreements in place that allow us to speak to one another.\u201d Santa even has a call sign \u2014 a phrase he can use to identify himself. \u201cIt\u2019s changed over the years,\u201d Hillier says.

            "Mammals are named for their ability to produce milk. But scientists have found that a few species that are not mammals feed their young this way, too. These include certain spiders, fishes, cockroaches and birds \u2014 and now, snake-shaped amphibians.

            "Herpetologist Carlos Jared of the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, has been studying these animals for years. After hatching, ringed caecilian babies live with their mothers for two months. Jared and his research team found that the babies spent much of their time around the end of their mom\u2019s body. That\u2019s where there\u2019s an opening called a vent. It\u2019s shared by mom\u2019s reproductive, digestive and urinary systems.",

They can appear anywhere on Earth, as long as there are ice crystals in the atmosphere. This often happens with wispy, high-flying cirrostratus clouds.

            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, CO2 works like a blanket. It traps heat, warming our climate. Humans add a lot of CO2 to the air when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, for energy. Carbon capture can reduce this climate-warming CO2 pollution.",
            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

            "A vampire bat working out on a tiny treadmill helped scientists figure out the quirks of its metabolism.",
            "Vampire bats live on a strictly blood-based diet. So strict, in fact, that they seem to process their food more like some blood-feeding flies than like other known mammals.",
            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",
            "Researchers shared these findings November 6 in\u00a0Biology Letters.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/rjBtx8AMR_Q?start=3&feature=oembed",
            "Researchers put vampire bats through their paces on a mini treadmill to discover what fuels their metabolism.",
            "The discovery means the vampire bats power along much like blood-feeding tsetse flies or some mosquitoes. That\u2019s a first for mammals, thinks Ken Welch. He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often."

Cutting the corpus callosum quieted them. And it didn\u2019t seem to have a big effect on normal brain function.",

If you measure the properties of one particle, you automatically know the properties of the other. And whatever happens to one will also affect the other.",

His problem was that with entangled particles, it would be possible to instantly tell someone what\u2019s happening infinitely far away. This would suggest that information can travel infinitely fast. And nothing, not even information, is supposed to be able to travel faster than the speed of light.

In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",

            "The heart beats steadily from long before you\u2019re born to the day you die. Triggering each beat (illustrated in background by an electrocardiogram line) is a zap of electricity \u2014 literally the pulse of life. ",
            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GMBSU-2GK3E?feature=oembed",
            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",
            "*an_animation_showing_the_electrical_signal_that_travels_through_the_various_parts_of_the_heart_to_ca",
            "fCKalumet/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)",
            "This animation shows the electrical signal, or action potential, coming from the heart\u2019s right sino-atrial node (at animation\u2019s top left). That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."
