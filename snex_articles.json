            "Chocolate\u2019s flavor doesn\u2019t just come from the plant that produced the cocoa beans. Taste is also shaped by yeast and bacteria during fermentation. That\u2019s a key part of the chocolate-making process where microbes convert sugars and other molecules in the beans and pulp (white surrounding beans inside the pod, middle and left) into fine flavors.",
            "The flavor of chocolate can vary a lot from piece to piece. Some chocolate treats may have a slight fruity tang. Others may carry hints of floral or even nutty flavors. Scientists knew that soil, rainfall and other conditions on cocoa bean farms shaped chocolate\u2019s taste. But new research now shows that the flavor of chocolate depends mostly on the wild microbes that ferment the cocoa beans.",
            "One might think cocoa plants\u2019 DNA would determine the taste of chocolate. But \u201cfermentation also is driving the flavor,\u201d says David Gopaulchan. \u201cI would even argue, [it] has an even bigger impact on the flavor.\u201d Gopaulchan studies plant genetics at the University of Nottingham in England. He and his colleagues shared the new findings in the September\u00a0Nature Microbiology.",
            "Past studies have identified microbes involved in cocoa fermentation. But this work \u201cpulled out all the stops to try to understand the process,\u201d says Rachel Dutton. This microbiologist wasn\u2019t involved in the work. But her company Microcosm Foods in Berkeley, Calif., studies fermented foods.",
            "Gopaulchan\u2019s team worked with three women-owned farms in Colombia. All grow similar strains of cocoa. Two of the farms produced fine chocolate while the third made bulk chocolate. (Fine chocolates\u2019 floral, fruity and other subtle flavors set them apart from plain bulk chocolate.)",
            "The researchers tracked the temperature and pH in fermenting beans from each farm. They also tracked the microbes at each stage of the process.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Yeasts were some of the first microbes to belly up to the chocolate bar. They broke down sugars in the beans, turning them to alcohol. This process created heat within 24 hours of fermentation. That heat killed the beans and kept them from sprouting.",
            "After 48 hours, some types of bacteria began to multiply. Those bacteria turned the alcohol made by the yeasts into acids. That increased the pH of the bean batch. The bacteria also further broke down the beans and the pulp that surrounded them. Other yeasts and bacteria soon joined the party. They turned the compounds made by earlier microbes into tasty molecules.",
            "The timing and speed of the temperature and pH changes are key for making flavors, says Aimee Dudley. So are the transitions between microbes, she adds. Dudley studies yeast genetics but was not involved in the new study. She works at the Pacific Northwest Research Institute in Seattle, Wash.",
            "Gopaulchan and colleagues wondered if they could put together microbe teams to mimic what they\u2019d seen. To find out, they looked at the DNA of the microbes involved in fermenting the beans. That allowed them to pick out microbes linked to certain flavor compounds. They could then predict a combo of microbes that should produce the two farms\u2019 fine chocolate flavors.",
            "The researchers put together bacteria-yeast mixes and fermented small batches of beans in the lab. A panel of expert tasters tested the lab-fermented beans. They confirmed that the flavors did match the two farms\u2019 chocolates. Some of those flavors included notes of orange blossom, citrus and tropical fruit.",
            "*A_field_of_dark_brown_fermented_cocoa_beans_dries_in_the_sun_on_a_Colombian_cocoa_farm_after_yeast_a",
            "fCYeast are the first microbes to start fermenting cocoa beans. These beans are drying after fermentation on a chocolate-producing farm in Huila, Colombia. Yeasts convert sugars in the beans and pulp to alcohol. They also make other chemical compounds. Bacteria then alter those molecules, producing flavors.",
            "The lab mix wasn\u2019t perfect, though. It lacked caramel, nut and light wood flavors from the farm-made chocolates. It also had more grassy notes than the fine chocolates did.",
            "Still, the study shows that microbes that ferment cocoa form predictable communities, says Dutton. She has found similar predictable bunches of\u00a0fungi and bacteria in cheese. In cheese and chocolate, different strains of local microbes bring their own flavors.",
            "In the future, lab-made microbe mixes could be used to produce designer flavors, Gopaulchan says. They could create flavors that don\u2019t exist. Or ones that are hard to find in natural fermentation.",
            "But some chocolate makers aren\u2019t on board with that idea. Take Luisa Bedi and Martyn O\u2019Dare. They make chocolate at Luisa\u2019s Vegan Chocolates in Nottingham, England. Lab-made microbe mixes \u201cwould be very much rejected by the craft chocolate producers and market,\u201d they say. Using pre-mixed microbes could reduce the variety of chocolate flavors. And there\u2019s no need for those mixes when \u201cgood farming practices already produce great tasting chocolate.\u201d",
            "Lab-based microbes might also make too much of some compounds that flavor fine chocolates, Dudley says. \u201cHumans have a very sharp boundary for what tastes really good and what tastes awful,\u201d she says. \u201cYeast make the amount of those compounds at exactly that boundary of what humans think is palatable.\u201d Messing with the mixes could cross the line. And that could turn chocolate from delicious to disgusting.",

Even deep sea sediments are home to unique microbes.",

            "In one experiment, Hampson\u2019s team placed wires about as thick as a strand of hair in the brains of 17 patients with epilepsy. (The researchers chose patients with epilepsy because they often have wires placed in their brains to map and understand their seizures.) The wires recorded the electrical activity of brain cells in the hippocampus. That\u2019s a part of the brain that processes memories.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Patients then looked at a picture on a computer screen. A few seconds later, the screen showed that same picture, plus three different pictures. Patients were asked to choose the picture they had first seen. They repeated this process 100 times, then took a short break.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Afterward, patients were shown 100 more pictures. These included pictures they had seen in the first part of the experiment. There were also pictures they had never seen. The patients were asked to touch the picture they were most familiar with.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When we see a picture, electrical activity courses through our brains, says Hampson. But this electrical activity was different for every picture.

And dark lightning is a natural source of gamma radiation. That\u2019s why some experts call dark lightning by another name: terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.",
            "We cannot see dark lightning. That\u2019s because we cannot see gamma rays. Our eyes can only detect light within a specific wavelength range. Light within that range is what we call \u201cvisible light.\u201d Any light outside that range is invisible to us. Gamma rays have much shorter wavelengths than the light in our visible range.",

            "Lightning occurs when opposing electrical charges build up at the top and bottom of a storm cloud. Often, a negative charge builds up at the bottom of a cloud and the top remains more positive. These electrical fields energize electrons. Sometimes, this difference discharges as a bolt of electricity. We see that as regular lightning.",
            "Experts think dark lightning arises in much the same way. Energized particles can crash into atoms in our atmosphere. Collisions between atoms and the high-velocity particles releases a lot of energy. And these collisions can emit gamma rays. Scientists suspect this may contribute to bursts of dark lightning. ",
            "However, it must require just the right conditions because dark lightning is rarer than regular lightning. Experts estimate about a thousand bursts of regular lightning occur for every one bolt of dark lightning.",

            "Vampires have been stalking the human imagination for centuries. These fictional creatures take many forms, including the famous Count Dracula and Morbius of the Marvel Universe. But most share one feature: long, razor-sharp teeth. These fangs help vampires bite the necks of victims to feast on their blood.",
            "Many real bloodthirsty creatures exist in nature. Vampire bats are perhaps the most famous. Mosquitoes and ticks also make the list, as do some spiders and moths. But it would be hard to turn a human body \u2014 even an undead one \u2014 into a blood-drinking monster.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe can\u2019t survive the way vampires do,\u201d says David Begun. This paleoanthropologist studies how apes, including humans, evolved. He works at the University of Toronto in Canada. In real life, no primates survive on blood, Begun notes. To do so, vampires would need to rework both the mouths and guts that humans inherited from our plant-eating ancestors.",
            "In popular media, vampires puncture skin using knifelike upper canine teeth. Humans occasionally use their canines to tear food, too. But any vampire would probably struggle to reliably break skin. \u201cOur canines are completely unsuited to piercing anything,\u201d says Begun. \u201cThey look more like incisors, our front teeth.\u201d",
            "Human canines have slowly shrunk over time. Like many primates today \u2014 including our close cousins, chimpanzees and gorillas \u2014 our ancestors once sported large, pointed canines. These impressive teeth would have even sharpened themselves by rubbing against neighboring molars.",
            "But anthropologists suspect that these flashy teeth weren\u2019t primarily for eating. Instead, ancient apes probably used them to intimidate rivals and defend themselves. Over time, these teeth grew smaller as our ancestors evolved to live in cooperative groups. Less fighting between males left little need for such large canines.",
            "Vampires would have to revert to big canines, says Begun. Those teeth would also need to be much sharper, more like the teeth of the only real blood-drinking mammals: vampire bats.\u00a0",
            "These blood sippers use their two front incisors to create tiny incisions in their prey. Unlike human teeth, these incisors don\u2019t have enamel. This allows them to remain permanently sharp and to not wear down over time. \u201cNo primate has such sharp canines that would allow that kind of thing to happen,\u201d says Begun.\u00a0",

            "fCUnlike their fictional counterparts, vampire bats (such as the one seen here) don\u2019t suck blood. Instead, these nocturnal predators use their upper incisors to pierce skin. Saliva containing anticoagulants then enters the wound, which prevents blood from clotting. The small bats then use their tongues to lap up the oozing blood. ",
            "Even movies that show vampires growing sharp canines at will would be unrealistic. If taken care of, our permanent teeth don\u2019t change much over the course of our lives. Instead, the size, number and shape of our teeth are all preset by our genes.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cThere are rodents that have continuously growing incisors,\u201d says Begun. Beavers, squirrels and rats are a few examples. \u201cBut they can\u2019t do it at will.\u201d In fact, these rodents must grind their teeth or gnaw on hard items such as wood and bone to keep them short. If left unchecked, overgrown incisors can interfere with eating, injure their mouths and even grow through their skulls.",
            "Finding ways to draw blood from victims isn\u2019t the only hurdle real-life vampires would face. They\u2019d also need to be able to digest it \u2014 and use that food as fuel for their undead activities.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Blood isn\u2019t particularly nutritious. Low in calories, it\u2019s mostly made up of water and protein. Because of their humanlike guts, any vampire would probably suffer from malnutrition or even poisoning.\u202f",
            "\u201cHumans can\u2019t survive on blood alone,\u201d says Begun. \u201cWe need a lot more diversity of nutrients, of vitamins and minerals, that aren\u2019t present in blood.\u201d\u00a0",
            "That\u2019s because we inherited our digestive systems from a long line of omnivores, or animals that eat both plants and other animals. Like today\u2019s chimpanzees, our ape ancestors would\u2019ve likely eaten mostly plants with an occasional helping of meat, says Begun. Long, coiled intestines probably helped them break down tough plants. And bacteria in their guts likely helped further digest this food and absorb nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "By about 2.5 million years ago, our ancestors started eating more meat. Later, humans started cooking with fire. That made digesting foods such as meat and tough plants much easier. Even more recently, people began growing starches such as grains to eat.\u00a0",
            "This led to tweaks in our digestive tracts. We started producing extra enzymes that could break down starches. Meat and other easy-to-digest foods could be broken down in shorter intestines. This resulted in bodies best suited to eating many different foods, says Begun.\u00a0",
            "Even vegans who don\u2019t eat any animal products must have a varied diet. \u201cThey can\u2019t just eat lettuce all day long,\u201d Begun says. \u201cThey have to have beans. They have to have rice. They have to have complete proteins.\u201d ",
            "While low in most nutrients, blood does contain lots of iron.\u00a0Red blood cells hold about 70 percent of the iron in our bodies, where it helps carry oxygen to organs. But consuming too much iron can be toxic to humans, who have no way to digest or excrete large amounts of it. This iron overload can damage body organs, the nervous system and even cause death.",
            "Unlike humans, vampire bats have evolved ways to digest blood. Research suggests that vampire bats lost a gene that blocks intestinal cells from absorbing too much iron. Those gut cells are also short-lived and regularly shed. This lets the bats quickly absorb lots of iron and discard it through their waste. Meanwhile, their gut bacteria help break down proteins. These microbes may also produce extra vitamins not found in blood.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Scientists are still trying to understand why vampire bats started feeding on blood. Some suspect the habit arose from bats that fed on parasites such as ticks. Perhaps the bats eventually started feeding on the blood oozing from wounds left behind when they scarfed down these pests.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Whatever led bats to their taste for blood, it\u2019s clear humans weren\u2019t shaped by those same evolutionary pressures. And changing how a real species eats usually requires tens of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution. That\u2019s a lot more involved than the single bite needed to make a fictional vampire.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Still, this reality shouldn\u2019t stop movie-goers from enjoying vampires, Begun says. \u201cIt\u2019s still OK to enjoy a vampire movie or a vampire TV show, even if it\u2019s not actually feasible.\u201d"

Maybe crunchy broccoli florets with hummus comes to mind. These are all packed with nutrients \u2014 chemical substances that help our bodies function. Among those nutrients are traces of vitamins.",
            "Food scientists group vitamins and minerals together as micronutrients. That\u2019s because living things need these to survive \u2014 but only in tiny amounts. While both vitamins and minerals are essential, chemically they\u2019re quite different.",
            "Dietary minerals are elements that appear in soil and water. Calcium and iron are examples. Vitamins, in contrast, are molecules \u2014 made of several elements. Vitamins are also organic, meaning they contain the element carbon. ",

Rounding out the list are vitamins A, C, D, E and K. These all play essential roles in keeping our organs, tissues and cells working.",
            "Some, such as the B vitamins, help the body break down and release energy from food. Vitamin K allows our blood to clot. Vitamin A is important for our lungs, skin and eyes.Vitamin D is a pro-hormone. The kidneys turn it into a fully active hormone. And it\u2019s quite versatile. This hormone plays a pivotal role in building strong bones and muscles and protecting the body from diseases, including some cancers. This vitamin also helps fight infections.",
            "Other vitamins \u2014 such as C and E \u2014 are antioxidants. They help protect against unstable molecules. At high levels, such molecules, called radicals, can damage cells and DNA.",
            "Vitamin C also supports your immune system in various ways. For instance, it helps keep immune cells healthy. But vitamin C also helps create collagen. A protein, collagen serves as a building block for many tissues, including our skin and the lining of our respiratory system. Those organs act as early lines of defense against incoming germs, explains Evangeline Mantzioris. She directs nutrition and food science at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.By keeping these systems healthy, vitamins help our bodies fight germs, limiting their chance of causing serious disease.",
            "Clearly, Mantzioris says, vitamins don\u2019t just target one specific body function or organ. They make sure our bodies as a whole work as they should.",

            "Fat-soluble vitamins \u2014 A, D, E and K \u2014 tend to show up in fatty foods. In fact, that fat helps our bodies better absorb these nutrients.

One reason: Covering up the body too much when in the sun. Sunscreen helps protect against skin cancers but limits vitamin D production. So does spending most of the daylight hours indoors. Darkly pigmented skin and very heavy cloud cover can limit exposure to the UV light that kick-starts vitamin D production. So can living at high latitudes, where a steep path through the atmosphere can filter out much of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light.\u00a0",

            "Whole foods contain more than just vitamins. For instance, oranges are an excellent source of vitamin C. But these and other types of fresh produce also contain hundreds of other nutrients that aren\u2019t found in artificial supplements, Mantzioris points out. These include plant compounds called phytonutrients. Such compounds give many fruits and veggies their vibrant colors. Scientists suspect they also boost health and fight disease. And new ones are still being discovered. ",
            "Supplements can be useful, though. People with certain medical conditions may need help getting enough of some vitamins. And it\u2019s hard to reach the recommended amount of vitamin D through food alone. Vitamin D supplements may help those with heavily pigmented skin or whose skin doesn\u2019t get access to enough of the sun\u2019s UV rays.But these supplements should only be taken after talking with your doctor, says Mantzioris. One reason: Mixing vitamin supplements with certain medications can be risky. ",
            "Some vitamins, such as A, can be toxic when taken in high amounts. But poisoning is highly unlikely to happen when they\u2019re consumed as part of a balanced diet. Most people who consume too many vitamins do so by taking supplements.Taking too many supplements also risks flooding the body with more nutrients than it can handle. Fat-soluble vitamins can build up in our fat stores over time, leading to dangerous side effects. Even overdosing on some water-soluble vitamins can pose problems.Cases of poisoning from water-soluble vitamin B6, for instance, are on the rise in Australia, notes Mantzioris. In addition to supplements, this nutrient is often added to energy drinks, weight-loss shakes and certain food products. One symptom of too much B6 is nerve damage. It often starts as a tingling in the fingers and toes. \u201cIf it\u2019s not caught in time, it can cause permanent damage,\u201d Mantzioris says.Instead of splurging on supplements, Mantzioris recommends that people looking to stay healthy should focus on a food-first approach. \u201cPeople spend a lot of money on these [vitamin supplements] \u2014 and mostly without a lot of gain,\u201d says Mantzioris. \u201cI would rather spend the money on having really yummy food.\u201d",

            "If a werewolf is all big, scary predator, the full moon might be a blessing. But if the animal could face predators itself, it might want to save its transformation for a much darker night.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The dark depths of an ocean or stream might not seem like the obvious place for animals affected by the moon. But \u201cit is something that we see pretty commonly among aquatic critters,\u201d says Heidi Ballew. She\u2019s a marine ecologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ballew studies the \u2018O\u2018opu nakea (Awaous stamineus), a goby native to Hawaii. The hardy little fish are born in freshwater streams in the hills. From there, a goby\u2019s life can take two very different paths depending on when it\u2019s born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When the moon is full, the sun, Earth and moon are lined up. This produces higher tides. Some gobies hatch during that full moon. The higher tides sweep their tiny bodies out to sea. When they are grown, higher tides during the new moon (when the sun, moon and Earth line up again) help them find their way back to their home streams. Special fins on their bellies, modified into suckers, help them climb waterfalls back to their birthplace. There, they mate and make more gobies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/mmwM7dwtvKA?feature=oembed",
            "Waterfall? Not a problem. Watch a goby climb up a waterfall with her mouth and her sucker-like fin.\u00a0",
            "But not all gobies go out to see the world. Gobies born during the dark of a new moon stay home and never leave the stream where they are born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Baby gobies are trying to avoid predation, Ballew says. \u201cA full moon provides a high tide. But it also produces a lot of light \u2014 even underwater.\u201d Night-hunting fish can better see tiny, defenseless gobies. So if a fish is going to stay put, hatching at the new moon is a safer bet.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The moon matters even as they grow into adults. A big, well-fed baby goby may become an adult during the full moon. But a smaller goby might become an adult at the new moon instead. The darkness hides these still-small, newly adult gobies, keeping them safe from predators. Ballew and her colleagues published their fishy findings February 26 in the journal Ecology of Freshwater Fish.\u00a0",
            "So there are pros and cons to lots of moonlight. A full moon lights up the night and makes it easy to spot dinner. But if a werewolf is as likely to become prey as it is to go hunting, a new moon might help it hide.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "In one study, Ritchie and his colleagues took photos of animals in southeastern Australia at different phases of the moon. Prey species such as possums and rabbit-sized bandicoots were more active when nights were cloudy. The extra darkness provided cover to hide from predators.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But predators such as quolls were also more active when it was darker \u2014 when the moon was new or half. Each species was trying to find a balance between getting more food and becoming someone else\u2019s dinner.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "\u201cPredators often use ambush to capture their prey,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cThe lighter it is, the harder it might be [for predators] to avoid detection.\u201d While the prey might be able to spot a predator more easily, they, too, may be more detectable. \u201cThey [might] be more hesitant to be active, especially in areas without much cover to retreat to.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ritchie and his colleagues published their findings in 2020 in the journal Australian Mammalogy.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Werewolves also need to find that balance between predator and prey. If a werewolf wanted to hunt as much as possible, \u201cthey would hunt humans by day and night,\u201d Ritchie says. But being a werewolf isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cMany prey, including humans, are often far from harmless.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In that case, Ballew says, a werewolf might be advised to vary its strategy. A big, strong werewolf could find good hunting during the full moon. But if a werewolf is small, young, or weak? \u201cMaybe you would want to utilize the new moon so that your predators are less likely to find you.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson a werewolf could learn from the gobies that stayed home.\u00a0\u00a0"

That allows the newborns to start off life with a feast.",

Some shark embryos eat their brothers and sisters while still in their mother\u2019s womb. Only the strongest embryo survives to be born.",

I went to a local haunted attraction and had a light bulb moment. I had spent all my time thinking about fear as this negative thing. Yet here I was lining up to spend money and my time to be scared.

But research shows that we find new and unusual experiences more engaging, fun and scary. Thinking about the importance of where a haunt is and who lives there is important.

Snakes may be the most famous venomous creatures. Snakebites cause an average of 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. But throughout the animal kingdom, critters on land and sea can produce this toxic tool.",

Venomous animals inject their toxins with a puncture wound. They might use teeth, fangs, spikes, spurs or stingers. Poisonous animals, on the other hand, are usually harmful only when eaten or touched.",

            "Have you ever wondered why leaves change from green to an amazing array of yellow, orange and red hues during the fall?",
            "Leaves get their brilliant colors from pigments made up of various color-creating molecules. During the warm, sunny months, plants use their leaves to turn sunlight into food energy, a process called photosynthesis. This primarily uses a pigment that reflects green light, which gives the leaves their characteristic color. In autumn, when colder, shorter days arrive, many kinds of trees no longer make food energy with their leaves and, consequently, no longer need the green pigment. The leaves\u2019 other pigments \u2014 some of which were already there during summer \u2014 become visible.",
            "In this science activity, you will uncover these hidden colors by separating plant pigments with a process called paper chromatography. What colors will you see?",

            "In this science activity, let\u2019s use paper chromatography to uncover the hidden pigments lurking in tree leaves.",
            "Because some plant pigments can stain, be careful not to spill your colored solutions when throwing them away.",
            "Even though a plant leaf looks like it is mostly one color, it is actually made up of a mixture of pigment molecules. In this activity, a scientific technique called\u00a0paper chromatography\u00a0was used to separate the individual color pigments. You should see different colors at different locations as you go along one of the paper towel strips, and the order in which the colors appear should be roughly the same among the different color solutions you tested.",
            "What are the different bands of color on the test strips? These are the different pigments in the leaves. The ones you may see on your paper towel strips are: green chlorophyll, yellow xanthophylls, orange carotenoids and red anthocyanins. Pigments travel along the paper strip based on their interactions with the paper strip and the isopropyl alcohol solution. Pigments that are more attracted to the paper strip than the isopropyl alcohol stay near the bottom of the strip, where the solution was first \u201cpainted\u201d onto the pencil line. Pigments that are more attracted to the alcohol than the paper strip usually travel farther up the strip. Because the color of the leaf depends on the mixture of pigments in it, different colored leaves will display different colors on their paper towel strips. For example, very green leaves may not have any red colors (anthocyanins) on their strips.",

            "Want to know more about paper chromatography? Science Buddies explains.",
            "There are many types of pigments in plant leaves. Chlorophyll makes them look green and helps carry out photosynthesis during warm, sunny months. As fall arrives and the green, food-making color fades, other pigments such as yellow, orange and red ones become more visible.",
            "Xanthophylls are yellow pigments, and carotenoids give leaves an orange color. Photosynthesis also uses these pigments during the summer, but chlorophyll, a stronger pigment, overpowers them. These pigments take more time to break down than chlorophyll does, so you see them become visible in fall leaves. They are also found in carrots, daffodils, bananas and other plants that have these vibrant colors.",
            "There are also anthocyanins, intense red pigments that are not made during the summer, only appearing with the final group of the fall colors. These molecules also give the red hue to apples, cranberries, strawberries and more.",
            "Although a leaf is a mixture of these pigments, you can separate the colors using a method called\u00a0paper chromatography. In this method, a mixture (such as your pigment mixture) is applied onto a chromatography paper. The paper strip is dipped into a liquid, called the solvent or mobile phase. The liquid will start traveling up the paper strip and carry all the components within the mixture (such as your different color pigments) along through the chromatography paper. While traveling up the paper, each component interacts with the paper and the solvent differently depending on its chemical properties. Some of them are more attracted to the paper, whereas others prefer to stay in the mobile phase. As a result, each individual component travels along the paper at a different speed. This is how with paper chromatography a colorful mixture of pigment molecules can be separated into each individual pigment component.",

An applied physicist at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, he\u2019s the lead author of a study describing the event. It appeared online July 31 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.\u00a0",

In contrast, these massive bolts can discharge electricity for spans lasting up to 100 milliseconds. They might infuse their energy into a tree or other target. That might even become the powerful trigger for a wildfire.",
            "The 2017 cloud-to-cloud record-breaker emerged from a massive thunderstorm system that swept across the U.S. Midwest. It sparked at least 116 cloud-to-ground spikes along its path.",

            "Researchers hope that satellites \u201cstaring\u201d continuously at such hot spots will help uncover why megaflashes periodically occur. (Some satellites sit above a single place on Earth. They travel in what\u2019s known as a geostationary orbit.)",
            "Megaflashes \u201chave the same ingredients as ordinary lightning,\u201d notes Peterson \u2014 \u201cbut with a twist.\u201d The heart of thunderstorms can contain many rain and ice particles. These rise to different heights due to updrafts. Each particle can carry an electric charge.",
            "When particles collide, their charges can transfer, forming lightning.",
            "There\u2019s a limit to how high these cloud particles can rise. Thunderstorm cells don\u2019t tend to kick them up higher than 11 kilometers (about 7 miles). This is the upper boundary of Earth\u2019s troposphere, or lowest atmospheric layer.",

So to \u201cincrease our understanding and build a database,\u201d Harel says, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to do a lot of experiments on different viruses in different environments.\u201d",

Although most are harmless to people, a few strains can cause serious disease. Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",
            "To find out, scientists will have to just keep listening. Once they have a robust library of sounds, they may be able to tell most microbes apart. That because microbial sounds are very specific, Harel says. It\u2019s like listening for a friend\u2019s voice in a loud place. Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",
            "There\u2019s plenty of research left to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at biology,\u201d Harel explains. For now, he says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see because very few people have ever looked.\u201d",
            "But one day, this type of tech might prove useful beyond the lab. For instance, it could be used in sensors installed at airports and other crowded places. These could then listen for worrisome microbes \u2014 and send out warnings of which ones (and how many) are out there.",

            "Some people see a pickleball and want to smash it. When Anchal Sareen saw some pickleballs lying around a lab a few years ago, she thought about submarines and airplanes. As a mechanical engineer who studies how fluids affect movement, she couldn\u2019t help it. So she went right out, bought a balloon and wrapped it around the pickleball. It became the inspiration for a new surface to speed and steer aircrafts and underwater drones.",
            "The surface has dimples, like a golf ball. But they\u2019re adjustable. Add air and the dimples smooth out. Remove air and the dimples deepen.",
            "In a pair of recent papers, Sareen and her team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor have now shown how dimple depth can alter drag. Drag is the friction-like force that slows things down as they travel through a fluid. They\u2019ve also shown how changing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dimples can help steer an object through air, water or other fluids.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a cool idea,\u201d says Christopher Douglas at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Drag is a big challenge, he says. \u201cAnything you can do to minimize drag is great,\u201d says this mechanical engineer who did not work on the new skin.",

            "fCThe dimples on this sphere can be made deeper or shallower. Their depth affects drag. Here, the sphere is hanging in a wind tunnel for testing.",
            "Douglas studies fluid flow as a way to improve the systems that propel vehicles. Engineers, he notes, have long been altering surface roughness to reduce drag.",
            "But drag isn\u2019t always a bad thing, he adds.",
            "Fins and rudders guide a ship by increasing drag in one place more than in another. This nudges a ship in a desired direction. And dimples might help here, too, says Sareen. She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",
            "They tested these plastic models in wind tunnels to identify how dimple depth affected drag.",
            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/De2VQYkdztM?feature=oembed",
            "Anchal Sareen and her team explain how they used soft robotic technology to develop dynamic surface dimples \u2014 ones that can change at different flow speeds \u2014 to cut the drag experienced by underwater vehicles. It should also allow them to maneuver without fins and rudders.",
            "They\u2019re also developing tests to see if the design would work in real-world conditions, such as the skin of some vessel sailing through air or water.",
            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",
            "\u201dA lot of people have asked me, \u2018Are you planning to patent this as a golf ball which can stay in the air?'\u201d Sareen laughs and says: Not any time soon."

And this can happen even where you can\u2019t smell any car exhaust. Atmospheric chemists at Texas A&M University in College Station shared their new findings here, on August 18, at the American Chemical Society fall meeting.",
            "People expect to find air pollution in and around cities. There, vehicles cough pollutants out of their tailpipes. But at Texas A&M, \u201cthe air smells beautiful,\u201d says Renyi Zhang. The campus is about 100 miles away from the closest big city. Here, he notes, the air is usually safe to breathe.",
            "But that may not be true during heat waves. Zhang\u2019s team collected data on campus. During a month-long event in August 2024, daytime temps hit 32\u02da to 41\u02da Celsius (90\u02da to 106\u02da Fahrenheit). And it wasn\u2019t just the heat that made these days uncomfortable. Pollution ramped up, too. Levels of lung-irritating ozone got especially high. It rose nearly to a level deemed hazardous to breathe.",

            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

Ozone levels, in particular, climbed as the heat rose. Then they stayed high throughout the hottest part of the day. That in itself was no surprise. Trees ramp up isoprene release during heat waves. Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",
            "The surprise was just how high the ozone levels climbed. If you just looked at the levels of other pollutants, like the nitrogen oxides from cars, you might think the air was safe to breathe.",

Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible.

            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change?

            "Longer wings \u2014 those more than about 1.7 millimeters \u2014 evolved more bristles and ones that are more closely spaced. As those bristles get very tightly packed, they eventually start to look more like a membrane.",

He knew exercise could boost memory and other types of learning. That made him wonder how little exercise was needed.",
            "Previous studies had tested the benefits of 20 to 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise. It might be riding a stationary bike or walking on a treadmill. But those regimes can\u2019t be done in a classroom. And they\u2019d take a lot of time away from lessons.",
            "Drollette wanted to develop a program that would take just a few minutes. It would also have to fit into a classroom setting, which often has limited space. Ideally, it would be something kids could do right at their desks.",

            "fCStudy participants demonstrate activities that can fit into the space next to their desks in a classroom.",
            "What his team came up with was a nine-minute high-intensity interval program.",
            "High intensity refers to how quickly someone reaches a target heart rate. Such exercises really get our blood pumping.",
            "Interval refers to the insertion of breaks between bouts of exercise. Kids might exercise for 30 seconds, rest for the next half minute, then do another 30-second bout. High knees, star jumps, jumping jacks, hops, lunges, squats and kicks would all qualify.",

            "fCOne study participant does jumping exercises while wearing a heart rate monitor and an EEG cap. Each dot on the cap is a sensor that picks up brain activity.",
            "Drollette and his team recruited 25 students 9 to 12 years old. Each visited his lab three times. There, the kids wore a heart rate monitor and an EEG cap. Sensors in that cap read electrical nerve signals. This records how the brain is responding to specific events.",
            "The kids did a nine-minute activity session on each visit. One time it focused on high-intensity interval exercises. Another time, the kids rode a stationary bike. Watching a short educational video was the third activity. The researchers compared brain responses triggered by each of these different activities.",
            "Shortly after each activity ended, participants completed a test. A computer screen displayed five fish in a line. The test asked kids to note which direction the center fish faced. Sometimes all five fish faced the same direction (left or right). Other times, the center one faced the opposite way than the other four, making it harder to give the right response.",

            "Researchers track brain activity on a computer as the participant completes the fish test. The participant is separated from the researchers, so they don\u2019t distract her from her task.",
            "Participants also completed tests of math, word recognition, silent reading and sounding out fake words like \u201csnue\u201d and \u201cblirping.\u201d This last test measured how well students might struggle to pronounce a real word they didn\u2019t yet know.After high-intensity exercise, students showed a change in one brain response during the fish test. \u201cWe call it the uh-oh mechanism,\u201d Drollette says. It happens any time you think, \u201cuh-oh, I made a mistake.\u201d It also has a more formal name: ERN (short for error-related negativity).",
            "The ERN response allows us to recognize a mistake so we can correct it in the future.",
            "High-intensity exercise reduced the size of that response. Kids still realized when they\u2019d erred, but their brains didn\u2019t have to work as hard to pick up on that. The change suggests the exercise had made their brains more efficient.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The other two activities didn\u2019t show that benefit.Students also performed better after the high-intensity workout on tests that focused on language.",
            "For math, the students performed a bit less well after the high-intensity session than after less-intense exercise or watching the video. That could be due to fatigue, Drollette says. \u201cPhysical fatigue will fatigue cognitive abilities as well,\u201d he says. Tasks that require higher-level thinking, such as math, tend to be the first ones affected. The nine-minute session seemed to be just right without overdoing it.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GDgInyAn-C8?feature=oembed",
            "This video explains what an EEG is, what it measures and how it can decode electrical signals moving through the brain to give experts a bit of a window into which brain parts are not only active but working hard.",
            "\u201cThese findings are exciting,\u201d says Lauren Raine. She\u2019s an exercise scientist at Northeastern University in Boston, Mass., who did not take part in the study. \u201cIf we provide students with short, high-intensity exercise breaks,\u201d she says, \u201cwe may actually see improved academic performance and better processing of mistakes.\u201d",
            "Regular classroom exercise could also improve physical health, she adds.High-intensity exercise could have added benefits for teens, Drollette suspects. Why? It puts the brain in a mentally healthy state. An overactive ERN is related to anxiety and other mental health issues. High school is \u201cwhere we see a lot more anxiety among kids,\u201d he says. After finding a change in the ERN in younger kids, he now expects to see the same response in teens.\u201cBeing active can help with a lot of things that are going on in society,\u201d he says. That includes both mental and physical health. So, he recommends, \u201cFind opportunities to stand up and get moving.\u201d\u00a0",

            "*A_researcher_wearing_purple_nitrile_gloves_flosses_the_lower_incisors_of_a_mouse_with_floss_coated_w",
            "A pair of researchers gently floss a mouse\u2019s bottom incisors. The floss is coated with a vaccine that could help protect the animal against influenza.",
            "Here\u2019s a no-jab way to get vaccinated. Just open your mouth and floss. This approach works well in mice, scientists report. They hope a version for people could work, too.",
            "Not all vaccines are delivered with a needle. Some target the moist tissues in our bodies. Known as mucus membranes, we have them in our mouth and nose. Germs often invade the body through these mucus membranes. Building immune defenses in these parts helps disarm viruses upon entry. The flu virus, for example, usually enters our body through the nose. Then it heads toward the lungs.",
            "Protecting mucus membranes can be challenging. These moist tissues come into direct contact with the air and germs around us. Their cells are tightly packed to help keep pathogens out. But that can make it tricky to get a vaccine in and prompt an immune response.\u00a0",
            "Researchers have designed vaccines before that target places in the mouth, where cells aren\u2019t quite as close together. To do this, they used cheek patches or liquid drops under the tongue.",
            "Harvinder Gill, a bioengineer at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, came up with another idea. While reading a paper on dental structure, he learned about a leaky collection of cells at the base of a small pocket, where gums attach to teeth. Maybe here, he thought, is where his team should try to introduce a vaccine.",
            "There\u2019s just one problem. This pocket \u2014 the junctional epithelium \u2014 sits below the gumline. That makes it hard to reach.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "\u201cWe needed something more precise [than a drop of liquid],\u201d Gill says. \u201cAnd then we thought \u2018Oh, hey, we already have floss. \u2026 Why don\u2019t we just use [floss] to also deposit the vaccines into this location?\u201d",
            "He proposed testing this in mice. But that immediately raised the issue: How do you floss a mouse? No one had ever done that. Rohan Ingrole, a bioengineer at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, accepted the challenge.",
            "That led to even more questions. What\u2019s the best way to open a mouse\u2019s mouth? How does one get the floss in the right spot? And is there a way to protect the mouse\u2019s gums from damage?",
            "Initial tests flopped. While gently moving the floss back and forth over the bottom front teeth (incisors), the animals\u2019 jaws dropped down. Right away, the floss slipped out.",
            "\u201cOne day, after a failed attempt, I was just going around [the lab] and I saw this key chain lying on the table,\u201d Ingrole recalls. \u201cIt made me wonder: Can I use the ring of this key chain to provide support to the mouse jaw?\u201d That, he now says, \u201cturned out to be a game changer.\u201d\u00a0",
            "It worked. Yet even with this support tool, flossing a mouse is a two-person job.",
            "First, the mouse must be lulled into deep sleep with an inhaled anesthetic. Then, one person must gently hold the mouse in an upright position by the scruff of its neck. That person also pops the mouse\u2019s head through the key ring. This allows the animal\u2019s lower jaw to stay open and rest against the ring\u2019s edge. The second person then plays dental hygienist with a vaccine-coated piece of floss.",
            "See how floss can apply a dye (which glows under ultraviolet light) to a mouse\u2019s gum pocket on its right lower incisor. Scientists also made floss coated with different types of vaccines. These can be used to vaccinate mice against disease. One day we may be able to treat ourselves this way.",
            "That floss had been coated with a vaccine made from dead flu viruses or lab-made bits and pieces of them. With each swipe back and forth, that floss delivered the vaccine through the gum\u2019s junctional epithelium.",
            "The team tried four different types of vaccines. All boosted immune defenses in the mice. Eating or drinking right after flossing didn\u2019t affect how well the vaccine worked. What\u2019s more, the flossed vaccine was similar to a vaccine inhaled through the nose.",
            "Giving vaccine with floss may even be a bit safer than a nasal mist. Why? Noses have a direct connection to the brain, Gill notes. So safety tests of nasal vaccines must show there\u2019s no big risk of side effects in the brain. Vaccines given through the gums, by contrast, are unlikely to reach the brain.",
            "Gill and Ingrole\u2019s team shared its new findings July 22 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very clever, I like the strategy,\u201d says Stephanie Langel. She\u2019s a viral immunologist who did not take part in the new work. Langel works at Case Western Reserve University. That\u2019s in Cleveland, Ohio.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Both nasal and floss vaccines triggered immune defenses in the blood of mice. So both vaccines may help prevent severe disease and death. But compared to the floss vaccine, the nasal type caused more antibodies to hang out in mucosal linings (such as those in the nose), the new study found. And that means nasal vaccines might be better at preventing one individual from passing a virus to another, Langel says.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/N6KvqNDErp0?feature=oembed",
            "Here\u2019s why they think this flossing vaccine delivery may work in people too.",
            "The floss vaccine might be improved, however, by adding the right adjuvant (ADD-ju-vunt). This is some chemical or other material that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to some foreign substance. This might help the body make more antibodies in places like the saliva or nose. In turn, that should protect against invading germs.",
            "The floss vaccine has been tested in 27 human volunteers. The researchers coated a one-handed floss pick with a dye. It glows under UV light. Then the volunteers flossed their teeth. Afterward, the researchers used UV light to search for the dye. Flossing had deposited roughly 60 percent of the floss\u2019 vaccine into people\u2019s gum pockets, they found.",
            "Now the goal is to make flossing easier, Gill says, and to ensure that people are getting a consistent dose.",
            "Such vaccines might one day provide a painless, needle-free way to vaccinate, he says. And if people are comfortable with flossing their teeth with a vaccine, they could do it at home.",
            "In fact, self-vaccinations could be huge during a pandemic, Ingrole says. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scores of health-care workers had to help with vaccination efforts. \u201cImagine if you had this vaccine that could just get delivered at your doorstep,\u201d Ingrole says. To get a vaccine, he notes, you\u2019d \u201cno longer have to go stand in line for hours.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"
