            "Some flowers attract pollinators by emanating the smell of death. Examples include plants in the Eurya (left, E. japonica pictured), Asarum (A. simile, middle) and Symplocarpus (S. renifolius, right) groups. New research suggests all of these use the same genetic trick to achieve their awful stink.",
            "Not all plants attract pollinators by smelling sweet. Some stink like rotting meat or even dung. Those odors can attract flies that will pollinate them. This stench is much like the smell that comes from bacteria feasting on rotting corpses. How plants make such a foul smell has been a mystery \u2014 until now.",
            "Scientists in Japan looked at DNA in three unrelated groups of stinky plants. All had all evolved the same trick to produce this reeking scent. It involved\u00a0tweaking one gene. (Genes are bits of DNA related to certain traits.)",
            "The team shared its findings May 8 in\u00a0Science.",
            "First, the stinky plants all made an extra copy of a gene called\u00a0SBP1. This gene makes an enzyme. It helps break down a chemical called methanethiol (Meth-an-ETH-ee-awl). This molecule is already fairly smelly. It can build up in the mouths of some people who don\u2019t regularly brush their teeth. An oral condition can develop called halitosis, in which someone\u2019s breath becomes really stinky.",
            "The extra copy of SBP1 in the stinky plants is altered, or mutated. The affected gene now makes its enzyme with a few different amino acids in it. In some plants, three amino acids in this enzyme have been changed. Those plants include a type of wild ginger and the East Asian eurya shrub. In the Asian skunk cabbage, meanwhile, only two amino acids are changed.",
            "But those tiny changes have big impacts. The altered SBP1 enzyme no longer breaks down methanethiol. Instead, it links two of these molecules into dimethyl disulfide. That chemical is to blame for the much more putrid scent of rotten meat. It\u2019s also one of the chemicals responsible for the intense reek of the corpse flower (although the main ones there are putrescine and dimethyl trisulfide).",

            "fCSome plants lure flies for pollination by smelling like rotting flesh. To do this, they make a chemical called dimethyl disulfide. This comic shows how these plants may fool hungry carrion flies by making the chemical, which stinks like garlic or rotting fish.",
            "What benefit do plants get from making the foul-smelling molecule? They may attract more flies to pollinate them.",
            "Gene duplication \u2014 like these plants did with SBP1 \u2014 is pretty common. It has happened in the evolution of most life-forms, including\u00a0humans.",
            "Flawed extra copies of genes become the sources of new traits in many species. The reason is that copies of genes can mutate without harming the original gene. This allows species to try out new traits without losing their old ones.",

            "Food poisoning isn\u2019t something we easily forget.\u00a0Scientists have now homed in on what makes it so unforgettable. Alarm cells lock the experience into our brain\u2019s circuitry as a yucky memory. That\u2019s the finding of a new study on mice.",
            "Many of us have eaten something that left us sick. \u201cNot only is it terrible in the moment, but it leads us to not eat those foods again,\u201d notes Christopher Zimmerman. He\u2019s a neuroscientist at Princeton University in New Jersey.",
            "Getting sick just one time after eating an undercooked enchilada or burger can make us hate that food forever. And the food repulsion it triggers can develop even if it takes hours or days to start feeling sick after the meal.",

            "Mice usually need an immediate reward or punishment to learn something, notes neuroscientist Richard Palmiter. He works at the University of Washington in Seattle. Even one minute\u2019s delay between cause (say, pulling a lever) and effect (getting a treat) can be too long for mice to learn the two are related.",
            "Not so for food poisoning. Even a rodent\u2019s brain has no trouble linking a tummy torment now with something it ate quite a while earlier.",
            "That makes food poisoning one of the best ways to study how our brains connect events that are separated in time, Palmiter says.",
            "So researchers asked: How does the brain learn to hate foods that made us sick? After five years of experiments, Zimmerman\u2019s team now shows that effects in the brain can burn dangerous tastes into memory.",

            "Palmiter\u2019s group had shown that the gut tells the brain when it\u2019s feeling icky. How? It activates certain \u201calarm\u201d neurons called CGRP cells. \u201cThey respond to everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d Palmiter explains.",
            "To study how alarm neurons link food poisoning to food repulsion, Zimmerman\u2019s team at Princeton had mice drink grape Kool-Aid. A half-hour later, they injected the animals with lithium chloride. This made them ill. Two days later, they again gave the mice grape Kool-Aid.",
            "The team ran versions of this simple experiment again and again. And at each step, they peeked inside the brains of those mice to see what was happening.",
            "When the mice had first gotten sick after drinking grape Kool-Aid, their alarm neurons turned on. This event increased the sensitivity of amygdala cells that carried memories of the grape flavor.",
            "Those same amygdala cells also turned on when the mice encountered grape Kool-Aid again. This suggests alarm neurons had helped the amygdala remember foods that seemed dangerous.",
            "This effect didn\u2019t show up in mice that had tasted grape Kool-Aid before without getting sick.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The novelty that cues humans to remember food poisoning could rely on a bit more than just taste. Many unusual aspects of an eating experience can ick us out. It could be some spice blend. Or we may not like smells or other things that we pick up on in a restaurant that\u2019s new to us.",
            "The new study was largely motivated by \u201cpure curiosity,\u201d says Ilana Witten at Princeton. She\u2019s a coauthor of the study. And her team\u2019s findings might go beyond food poisoning, she now suspects. They might be \u201cvery relevant to mental health.\u201d",
            "Similar nerve pathways likely explain why unusual and bad experiences become so memorable, she says. But this event-triggered repulsion \u2014 known as aversive learning \u2014 sometimes goes wrong in people who have suffered a trauma or who have developed some addiction.",

Within 300 years or so, however, the site was abandoned. Today, many Native Americans hold the canyon grounds sacred. And more than two dozen Pueblo tribes consider the Chaco people their ancestors. Now, DNA has helped confirm ancestral ties to one Pueblo group.",
            "An analysis genetically linked ancient people at Chaco Canyon to the modern Picuris Pueblo Tribal Nation. Picuris Pueblo today live some 275 kilometers (170 miles) east of the canyon. People in the tribe have long told stories about descending from ancient North Americans. Those oral histories described ties to Chaco Canyon.",

The Picuris Pueblo Tribal Nation has objected to that use of its ancestral land. But those protests were ignored. So Picuris officials sought to strengthen their case. They looked for science to confirm their tribe\u2019s link to this land.",

The remains included people from Chaco Canyon.",

            "Scientists at first resisted returning such remains. But a 1990 U.S. law now requires that Native American artifacts and remains be given back to tribal descendants. That has raised pressure on scientists to link ancient remains to the correct modern tribes.",

            "Columbus, Ohio \u2014 Preserving threatened coral reefs is no longer enough. Now, we must help build new ones, say Ja Young Kim, 17, and Jiho Kong, 19. They\u2019ve just designed one new option: robotic nurseries to attract and nurture baby corals.",
            "These modular units start as floating, hexagon-shaped cells. Once deployed in the water, they can link together to make large ocean habitats. These apartment-like structures even monitor for potential dangers. Before turbulent weather might turn young colonies belly-up, robots can propel the coral apartment buildings to safety.",

No longer. The reef is now bleached white and dead.",
            "Dying coral is \u201cnot just a story that we can hear from newsletters or books,\u201d Ja Young says. For her, the problem can\u2019t be ignored. So she and Jiho teamed up to build a fleet of robotic apartment complexes for baby coral. It would provide them homes. And being mobile, they can move when storms threaten.",
            "Their work earned these juniors at Saipan International School a place here, last month, as finalists at the 75th annual Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF. Society for Science \u2014 which also publishes this magazine \u2014 created ISEF and still runs it. This year\u2019s 1,657 finalists came from 62 nations or territories. Together, they took home nearly $9 million in prizes.",

            "Their system consists of two types of cells. The first offers a safe harbor for coral larvae. They can attach to these \u201ccoral cells\u201d and grow. The second are power cells. These similarly shaped units can drive the coral-housing units. Each power cell \u201chas a propeller,\u201d Ja Young points out, and runs on solar energy. So power cells can motor coral cells to the perfect nursery location. Once they arrive, these cells can link together. A tether connects them to the ocean floor. This ensures they won\u2019t drift away.",

            "Their solution was to build an escape plan into their housing units. For example, Ja Young says, \u201cThere could be a typhoon coming.\u201d The undersea waves kicked up by such a storm could destroy the cells. \u201cWe cannot make the house not blow away,\u201d she says. But \u201cwe can make it run away.\u201d",
            "Their coral-housing units not only can move, but also decide when it\u2019s time to move.",

            "Their system\u2019s motorized cells use these data to make decisions. If a dangerous storm looms, these cells will know. They can turn on their propellers and head for safer waters. An \u201calgorithm and the website itself can also designate a destination,\u201d says Ja Young.",
            "Even if people do nothing, these cells can execute an escape. Thanks to clever programming, the cells can pick their own destination. They also can calculate the best route. This escape feature sets their technology apart from other coral-transplant systems, says Jiho. Few such technologies can flee danger. And those that do need a lot of human help. Human labor makes them \u201cless efficient in both cost and time,\u201d Jiho says.",
            "Each cell costs about $120 to make, says Ja Young. That\u2019s far less than similar technologies. Most, he says, cost about \u201ca thousand times more.\u201d",
            "The coral apartments must still undergo ocean tests. Simulations show a lot of promise. However, unseen problems could occur.",
            "Ja Young recalls the kaleidoscopic colors of local reefs from snorkeling trips with her dad. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s pink! Blue! It\u2019s colorful inside,\u201d she remembers. She was in middle school then. Today, waves sweep bleached coral fragments onto the sand. Ja Young hopes their new invention will do more than try to preserve the past.

            "The soft, 3-D printed robot doesn\u2019t have any electronic parts. All it needs to move is an air canister. One day, robots like this could work underwater or in hazardous environments, its creators say.",
            "Mechanical engineer Yichen Zhai led the work. He and his colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, gave their robot six flexible legs, like an insect. Each leg can move up and down or side to side. The whole thing is made from the same type of plastic that\u2019s used to make hoses and shoe soles. The scientists 3-D printed it in one piece over the course of two and a half days.",
            "Air from a canister flows through tiny tubes and chambers in the robot\u2019s body to power it. As the pressure in each of these chambers changes, it opens and closes different tubes. That moves air into different sets of chambers, and the process starts again. This cycle of inflating and deflating chambers moves the robot\u2019s legs to waddle forward.",
            "Researchers published the design in the May issue of the journal Advanced Intelligent Systems.",
            "The robot\u2019s design is \u201cquite interesting,\u201d says Perla Maiolino. She wasn\u2019t involved in building it, but she does work on other soft robots at the University of Oxford in England. Typically, making a robot involves designing different parts from different substances and assembling them, she says. But this one\u2019s body is a single piece made with just one material. \u201cIt\u2019s all together.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/f8hTK7AabM8?feature=oembed",
            "This video, told from the perspective of the new robot, shows off its electronics-free capabilities.",
            "The robot may be soft, but its shape actually makes it quite sturdy. Having six legs helps it stay upright on rough and uneven ground. Whenever it takes a step, three of its legs move at once while the other three stay on the ground. This way, it doesn\u2019t tip over easily. And because the design doesn\u2019t contain any electronics, it\u2019s waterproof. In experiments on the beach, the robot toddled right down into a deep puddle and resurfaced to continue along its way.",
            "Electronics-free robots could one day work in areas that would thwart regular ones. \u201cWe are really pushing toward having untethered robots that can be deployed in very harsh environments,\u201d Maiolino says. An \u201cuntethered\u201d robot is one that doesn\u2019t need to be connected to a power cord or controller.",
            "A robot like the new six-legged walker could work in areas where electronics might be a fire risk, such as in mines. Or it might be used in space, where radiation could harm delicate electronic components.",
            "But the new soft robot isn\u2019t quite ready for these harsh conditions yet. The robot has to be able to move faster first, says Zhai. That will let it move farther on a single air canister. As of now, the insect-like robot creeps along at a leisurely pace of 4 centimeters (1.6 inches) per second. That\u2019s a little faster than a snail, but slower than a turtle. A single canister of air can power it for about 80 seconds.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Zhai and his colleagues are currently building a faster version of their machine. The team also hopes to add a steering system or a way for the robot to dodge obstacles. Right now, it can only shuffle forward in a straight line. Controlling air flow through the robot could allow it to change direction in response to obstacles \u2014 sort of like a self-driving Roomba vacuum.",
            "Until the robot gets these upgrades, it won\u2019t be doing heavy-duty work. But in its current form, people can still enjoy interacting with it. \u201cThe robot is like a toy,\u201d Zhai says. And it can be cheaply and easily 3-D printed. \u201cIf people love it, people can make it,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d",

            "One ancient type of wasp appears to have had an especially freaky way to trap prey 99 million years ago. It used a mouth-like structure on its backside, fossils now suggest.",
            "\u201cWhen you look at the head, the thorax and the wings, [this wasp] looks quite normal,\u201d says Lars Vilhelmsen. But its abdomen is very different, the insect biologist points out.",
            "Most stinging wasps, such as yellow jackets, have rounded abdomens that end in a point. The ancient wasp\u2019s totally unique abdomen instead has flaps that lay on top of each other. He likens it to a plant \u2014 the Venus flytrap.",
            "Vilhelmsen\u2019s team shared its findings March 27 in BMC Biology.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s significant and amazing,\u201d he says, \u201cthat we can find something that looks like nothing that we see today.\u201d Vilhelmsen works at the Natural History Museum of Denmark. It\u2019s part of the University of Copenhagen.",
            "Along with researchers at Capital Normal University in Beijing, China, Vilhelmsen examined 16 wasp fossils. All had been unearthed from a valley in northern Myanmar (a Southeast Asian country also known as Burma).",
            "At first, Vilhelmsen couldn\u2019t believe it. He thought an air bubble trapped in the amber might have caused the wasps\u2019 abdomens to look so weird. But the amber in which they were encased had helped preserve their anatomy. And CT scans would confirm the abdomen truly was bizarre.",
            "*the_fossilized_wasp_is_suspended_in_amber",
            "fCThe ancient wasp is suspended in amber. This gives the fossil a yellowish tint and prevents it from decaying.",
            "Entomologist Anderson Lepeco, too, was shocked when he first saw pictures of these wasps. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen something like that,\u201d he says. Lepeco, who was did not take part in the study, works at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil.",
            "For a second, Lepeco thought the first wasp that he saw was deformed. But when all had the same anatomy, he became convinced that this species \u201cwas a really, really cool bug.\u201d",
            "The scientists named the wasp S. charybdis (Kur-IB-duss) after a sea monster in Greek mythology. Why? The wasp\u2019s abdomen reminded them of the mouth full of teeth depicted in some drawings of Charybdis.",
            "The wasp\u2019s abdomen is split into three flaps \u2014 an upper, middle and lower one. In a few fossils, the lower flap gaped far from the other two. In other specimens, the lower flap pressed tightly against the middle and upper ones. Because of this difference in position, the team thinks the flaps could grasp things.",
            "The lower flap also had several thin hairs poking out of it. These hairs would likely trigger the flaps to shut when a critter brushed against them, the team suspects. That\u2019s much like how the hairs on Venus-flytrap leaves trigger these leaves to snap shut, locking in a meal.",
            "*a_short_clip_of_a_shield_bug_walking_across_a_venus_flytrap_and_triggering_the_hairs_that_cause_the_",
            "fCWhen an insect, such as this shield bug, touches the trigger hairs of a Venus flytrap, the plant snaps its leaves shut.",
            "Predators usually trap prey. When a praying mantis catches its dinner, for instance, the prey is so close to its mouth it can dine quickly. But this wasp\u2019s weird abdomen is far from its mouth. It is much closer to the insect\u2019s egg-laying organ.",
            "For that reason, the scientists suspect these wasps might have wielded their back-end traps to restrain other creatures so that they could lay eggs on or inside of them.",
            "\u201cI think it\u2019s the most likely explanation,\u201d agrees Lepeco. Parasitoids are insects that lay their eggs on or in other animals, he notes \u2014 and \u201call the insects in [this wasp\u2019s] group are parasitoids.\u201d When a parasitoid\u2019s babies hatch, they\u2019ll feed on the animals that are carrying them.",
            "Lepeco studies a group of insects that use stingers to inject a paralyzing venom into their prey. Afterward, they lay their eggs on this victim. Lepeco suggests the newly discovered ancient wasps might have laid their eggs on other creatures to feed their hatchlings.",
            "Scott Shaw is an entomologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. He agrees with Lepeco that the most likely reason for the weird abdomen was to restrain insects. He, too, believes the wasps likely laid their eggs on their hosts, rather than inside of them. But, he adds, clearly \u201cno one has observed the behavior\u201d in the now long-extinct wasp. So scientists can\u2019t be certain of this.",
            "Still, the mere existence of this feature is remarkable, says Lepeco. Like dinosaurs and saber-toothed tigers, insects of the past were very special, he says. \u201cWe forget that at the same time those species were alive, there were also insects \u2014 and the insects were also cool.\u201d"

            "You can express a ratio in several ways. One way is to separate the numbers with a colon. You can also use a fraction. For example, rather than describing the sugar-to-flour ratio as 1:2, you could say \u00bd.",
            "Ratios play crucial roles in many fields of science. In chemistry, a material\u2019s density is the ratio of its mass to its volume. Ratios also help chemists scale up and down chemical reactions. In ecology, ratios help describe and monitor animal populations.",
            "Geometry makes use of a famous ratio called pi, or \u03c0. One side of the ratio is the distance around \u2014 or circumference of \u2014 a circle. The other side is the straight-line distance across \u2014 or diameter of \u2014 the circle. This ratio is about 22:7, or 22/7, for all circles no matter their size.",
            "Let\u2019s unpack what that means. If you measure a circle\u2019s diameter to be 7 centimeters (2.8 inches), you can assume its circumference will be 22 centimeters (8.7 inches). Double the circle\u2019s diameter, and you also double its circumference. This relationship allows us to calculate a circle\u2019s circumference from its diameter and vice versa.",

Water is a polar molecule, so it has plus and minus ends \u2014 just like magnets that attract each other. When the water molecules align with each other they stick together, creating surface tension.",
            "You might think it is the surface tension of the water that holds the skin of a bubble together. Actually, the surface tension of water is too strong to make a bubble. You can try yourself to blow a bubble with plain old water, it just won\u2019t work! A good bubble solution has a detergent added to it to relax the surface tension of the water, allowing it to have more elastic, stretchy properties. Now it can act more like the skin of a balloon, stretching out nice and thin, trapping air inside of the bubble like a liquid balloon.",

            "Confusion over the sun\u2019s color may come from mixing up two things \u2014 an object\u2019s apparent hue and the wavelength where its light is strongest. That last feature is known as the light\u2019s peak intensity. These two aren\u2019t always the same.",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",

            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",

Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Kirby, the University of Manchester scientist and author, says filmmakers have been consulting with scientists throughout movie history. \u201cThat surprises people,\u201d he says. Early on, though, such meetings were unusual. Then everything changed. Kirby calls the current (and growing) use of scientists in movies a \u201cpost-Jurassic Park phenomenon.\u201d",
            "Jurassic Park came out in 1993. The movie takes place on an island where a scientist has found a way to clone dinosaurs. Things don\u2019t go well. To make the movie, director Steven Spielberg consulted with Jack Horner, a paleontologist. Horner helped the filmmakers design real-looking dinosaurs for the screen. He even inspired one of the characters. The film wasn\u2019t entirely accurate \u2014 dinosaurs are still extinct \u2014 but the illusion worked. The movie was a spectacular success, in large part because it looked so real, says Kirby.",
            "Since then, Kirby says, scientific accuracy has become even more important. \u201cThe development of special effects now means that audiences expect realism in everything,\u201d he says.",
            "Teran says part of that is getting the physics right. Physicists study matter and energy. They also study mechanics. Mechanics refers to motion and the forces that produce it. And if something doesn\u2019t move right on the screen, Teran says, an audience can tell. \u201cIf the physics is wrong, the movie looks less real.\u201d",
            "Take snow: In the past, films didn\u2019t pay much attention to the white stuff, says Teran. That changed with Frozen. To get the snow to look realistic, he and his team borrowed a mathematical approach called the \u201cmaterial point method.\u201d Using this method meant the mathematicians treated big blobs of snow as being made of lots of little particles. Sometimes the particles stuck together and sometimes they fell apart \u2014 like when a packed snowball smashes against a wall.",

And that was a challenge: In the movie, characters dig in snow, walk through snow and fall in the snow. Snowballs stick together like a solid, but disintegrate under stress. Tweaking their program to cover all these behaviors required some creative programming. The scientists couldn\u2019t make the computer program too complicated \u2014 it had to be able to compute real snow in a short amount of time. To make matters worse, at a certain point Teran became convinced that his team was missing the mark.",
            "\u201cI didn\u2019t think it looked right,\u201d he said. One of his students, who was from Russia, insisted that the snow did look real. While on vacation, the student went to the mountains and shot video of real snow in action. He showed the video to Teran. Upon comparing real snow to their computer model, Teran finally admitted that their computer program had succeeded. \u201cOur snowballs looked pretty real.\u201d",
            "Special effects aren\u2019t the only area in which scientists work on films. Screenwriters and producers are also looking to researchers \u2014 and their findings \u2014 for ideas, including how to spin a better story. Kirby points to Finding Nemo. This 2003 animated movie is about a talking clownfish searching for his missing son.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorite examples of a scientifically accurate film,\u201d says Kirby, referring to the realism of the undersea habitats created onscreen. \u201cThe filmmakers did a lot of research and talked to a lot of scientists to make sure that film was as accurate as possible. Outside of having the fish talk, of course.\u201d",

            "And just as scientists inspire movies, the opposite is true as well, says Loverd, at the Science and Entertainment Exchange.",
            "Walk through any scientific lab and the odds are high that you\u2019ll see a picture of Star Trek\u2019s Spock, a Cylon from Battlestar Galactica or perhaps a superhero, Loverd says. \u201cThese characters have inspired scientists.\u201d",
            "He explains how the Exchange hosts events such as talks and retreats to give scientists and filmmakers a way to share ideas. As a result, he says, producers may \u201cleave our events with new ideas for films and TV shows, or make big changes to the project they\u2019re working on.\u201d Loverd notes that the system isn\u2019t perfect. A movie still may tweak the science if it makes the story better, after all.",

Creating real-looking effects \u201crequires a ton of math and a ton of physics,\u201d he says. Studying a STEM subject may seem like an unusual way to get involved with movies. However, Teran says Hollywood is showing strong demand for experts who studied math or science in college. Their help is needed, and will continue to be needed, in creating ever more sophisticated effects.",
            "\u201cLook at Shrek, a movie from 10 years ago,\u201d Teran says. \u201cAt the time, I thought it looked amazing. But I watch it now, and it looks worse than video games. So video games already look more realistic than older movies.\u201d",

All he can say is that the movies will require even more complicated calculations than Frozen did. Eventually, animation will become indistinguishable from live action.",

If you\u2019re close to the show, you can feel the pressure waves that ripple from each exploding shell. And folks downwind of the action can smell the burnt gunpowder that fueled each rocket \u2014 and perhaps even taste it in the air.",
            "More than 14,000 fireworks displays light the night each 4th of July, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association. (Pyrotechnics\u00a0is the art of making or displaying fireworks.) But Independence Day the isn\u2019t the only time for such shows. New Year\u2019s Eve is also a popular time for this colorful artistry. More and more often, even small celebrations, such as graduations, are going off with a bang. And then there are all of those sporting events and rock concerts. Altogether, pyrotechnic displays throughout the United States, last year, shot off more than 8.6 million kilograms (19 million pounds) of fireworks.",
            "These days, there\u2019s more to putting on a fireworks show than lighting a fuse and running for cover. Things can get really complicated \u2014 and quickly.",

            "Large shows can run for many minutes and involve thousands of shells. Many have a musical soundtrack that plays on the radio while colorful bursts light up the sky. For such shows, timing is everything. So people who design these spectacles have to make sure that each shell explodes at just the right moment. They also have to consider how a show might look from different angles and locations. Then engineers and technicians have to build the electronic circuits to control the action.",
            "But long before a show begins, people have to design the fireworks. At what height should each shell explode? How broad should the burst be? What color \u2014 or combination of hues \u2014 should each burst deliver? Answers to these and many other questions provide show designers with the outline for the pyrotechnic displays that become true crowd-pleasers.",
            "Fireworks were probably invented in China more than 2,000 years ago. There, people found that when they tossed a bamboo stalk into a flame, it exploded. As air pockets in the bamboo overheated, they\u2019d expand enough to shatter the stalk. The sudden bang would supposedly ward off evil spirits.",
            "Centuries later, chemists added a crude type of gunpowder to these bamboo bomblets. That made the bangs bigger. Somewhere along the line, people found that adding metal powders and shavings to their mixtures made things sparkle. Later, they developed rockets by packing these materials into stiff paper tubes.",

            "fCEach streak of light emanating from a fireworks burst comes from a packet of chemicals (one shown) that contains fuel, an oxidizer and the metallic powders that provide color when they vaporize. ",
            "Modern-day fireworks are high-tech versions of those ancient Chinese devices. Today\u2019s shells typically include some sort of fuel, often gunpowder. They also contain a chemical called an oxidizer. This helps the fuel burn more quickly. The shells also contain chemicals whose recipes include metals. Those metal-based compounds play a big part in determining the color of fireworks, explains Phil Grucci. He\u2019s the owner of Fireworks by Grucci in Bellwood, N.Y. His family business has been operating for almost 170 years.",
            "As a shell\u2019s fuel explodes, it releases a sudden burst of heat. That energy, in turn, excites electrons orbiting metal atoms packed along with the fuel, Grucci explains. Excited electrons jump to a higher orbital. Soon, they\u2019ll drop back to their original orbits again. At this point, the metal atoms emit a characteristic color of light.",
            "Different chemicals produce different hues. For example, chemicals that contain barium give off a greenish light. Copper yields a blue light. This can be easily seen in an experiment that\u2019s often a staple of high-school chemistry classes, says Grucci. A small wire is dipped into a powder and then thrust into a small flame. The color of the flame changes with the elements contained in the powder.",
            "To come up with a new color for a firework, members of Grucci\u2019s team, as well as the chemists they work with at other companies, do a version of that wire test. Now, however, these tests take place in bigger, better-funded labs.",
            "Coming up with a new color can take a lot of time and involve a lot of trial and error. But by choosing and mixing chemicals in the right proportions, chemists can make a shell that will display almost any color imaginable, he notes.",

            "On the small scale, the size and shape of particles inside a shell affect how quickly they will burn. That, in turn, affects how long a burst\u2019s glow lights up the sky. Also, as Chinese inventors long ago noted, slow-burning gunpowder doesn\u2019t explode. Instead, it gives off gases that can provide thrust for a rocket if they\u2019re forced through a nozzle.",

            "fCA lot of engineering went into the design of this record-breaking shell, which rose more than 1,100 meters into the sky with a burst that spanned more than a kilometer. ",
            "To design a fireworks shell that rises to a certain height before it blows up, there\u2019s a lot of math and lab work to be done. For instance: How quickly does 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of a particular mixture of gunpowder burn? What volume of gas does it give off? (Those things can be measured in the lab.) How much weight can that lift? (That can be measured in a field test.) Together, those data can help engineers figure out how much gunpowder will be needed to send a 10-kilogram (22-pound) shell, say, up 500 meters (1,640 feet) into the air.",
            "On larger scales, engineering challenges can be just as daunting. Consider the world-record-size shell that Grucci\u2019s company recently developed. The projectile measured about 1.5 meters (5 feet) across and weighed a whopping 1,000 kilograms (1.1 U.S. tons). It was fired from a tube and rose to a height of more than 1,100 meters (3,600 feet) before it burst. When the shell exploded, its colorful display measured more than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) across.",
            "One challenge, says Grucci, was fine-tuning the strength of the shell\u2019s outer casing, which was made of many layers of paper. For one thing, the casing had to be strong enough to survive the launch, he notes. (When the shell left its launch tube, it was traveling at a speed of 122 meters [400 feet] per second.) But the shell\u2019s outer casing couldn\u2019t be too\u00a0strong or the shell wouldn\u2019t burst open properly when it reached peak height, says Grucci. The engineers used computer software to estimate how shell casings of various thicknesses might stand up to the stresses of launch and explosion. At the same time, a different team was designing the steel tube needed to launch the shell. It ended up being 7 meters (23 feet) long. Designing and building it took his teams more than 10 months.",
            "\u201cDesigning that shell was quite an interesting journey,\u201d says Grucci. Near the end of the process, \u201call our math lined up,\u201d he notes. And the team\u2019s lab tests suggested that the shell would work, he adds. \u201cBut at some point in time you\u2019ve just gotta build it and launch it.\u201d",

            "Many challenges remain to be tackled, says Grucci. He\u2019d like to be able to reduce the amount of smoke that each shell produces. This might involve tweaking the ratio of fuel to oxidizer inside the shell. That, in turn, might lead to more complete burning of the chemicals inside the rockets. And needing smaller amounts of ingredients could greatly reduce overall costs. But there\u2019s another reason to go smokeless, he notes. Smoke emitted by shells designed to burst at low altitude can obscure the view of fireworks exploding higher up.",
            "Plus, Grucci would like to make his fireworks more ecofriendly. Smoke itself can be a problem, polluting the air. And many of today\u2019s shell casings are no longer bamboo, but plastic. As the shells explode, they send a rain of little plastic bits falling all over the ground. \u201cGreener\u201d fireworks, he says, might house the rocket\u2019s ingredients in polymers\u00a0that are biodegradable. That way, the debris that falls to the ground might naturally break down over time.",
            "A company that puts on only one or two fireworks shows per year probably wouldn\u2019t earn much money. So it pays to diversify beyond staging shows on the 4th of July and New Year\u2019s Eve. And many companies have done just that.",
            "Among them is Pyrotecnico, based in New Castle, Pa. It stages some 3,000 shows across the United States each year, notes owner Stephen Vitale. The majority of those are small community celebrations. But the company also has staged events that range from a Super Bowl halftime spectacular to weddings (where, Vitale says, \u201cOur fireworks are the icing on the cake\u201d).",
            "Fireworks are \u201cobviously a visual business,\u201d says Vitale. But shows, particularly the large ones, have really evolved in recent years. \u201cAbout 50 percent of the shows we do are choreographed with a musical soundtrack,\u201d he explains. \u201cWith music, crowds get more emotionally involved in the show.\u201d",

            "Making sure the soundtrack lines up with the bursting fireworks takes a lot of effort \u2014 and a lot of creativity. For each minute that a fireworks show lasts, his designers spend somewhere between 2 and 3 hours ahead of time getting the details right. They typically design the show using computer software. That software started out as an off-the-shelf program. Team members then tweaked the software to add new features. For instance, designers have to take into account how high a shell will fly, as well as how long it takes to reach that height and then burst to light the night sky.",
            "In a sense, Vitale says, a fireworks show is like staging a play. \u201cIn the first scene, you grab the audience\u2019s attention. After starting out strong, you program in a series of \u2018Wow!\u2019 moments,\u201d he points out. \u201cThen, you end with a bang!\u201d",
            "Designing the succession of bursts in a computer allows planners to visualize how a potential show will look. It also gives the company a way to preview the show. Designers can view via computer what the show would look like from any location in the area and from any angle. The team can then tweak the display as needed.",
            "The opportunity to be creative attracts a lot of people to the field, says Vitale. \u201cPeople get to be their own designer and choreographer, or direct their own play or movie,\u201d he notes. It\u2019s a very satisfying business, he adds. \u201cWe try to make a difference every day \u2014 to put a smile on people\u2019s faces.\u201d",

They also, among other things, decide where each shell should be fired from. In the virtual model that the designers create, events are precisely timed, Souza notes \u2014 \u201cusually down to the tenth of a second.\u201d They also work closely with clients to make sure that any musical soundtrack triggers \u201cexcitement, enjoyment and a lot of emotion,\u201d he adds.",

In the United States, these technicians usually are certified by local or state authorities. To be certified in California, for example, the technicians must go through a training program, take a detailed test and have two years of job experience.",
            "Besides being trained in safety, the technicians have to be handy with tools and keenly creative. These are the workers who turn the designers\u2019 visions into a reality. Some design and assemble the circuits that control when shells get fired. Others design and build the brackets that hold fireworks at a particular angle so that the shells will fly off and burst at the proper locations and heights. Yet other technicians may have to hang off the sides of skyscrapers and bridges to install brackets and wiring.",
            "More than 50 people helped set up the fireworks show that lit up the Brooklyn Bridge, notes Souza. It took two weeks to set up a show that was over in less than half an hour.",
            "Like all fireworks firms, Souza\u2019s company has to abide by state and local environmental rules. One recent challenge has been a need to reduce their use of chemicals called perchlorates\u00a0(Per-KLOR-aytes). If some of those oxidizers are left over when a shell explodes, they can drop into waterways or onto soil and affect animals and plants living or growing there. Not only that, they can be harmful to human health. Among other problems, they can reduce the production of hormones in the thyroid gland. \u00a0",
            "So, there\u2019s plenty of challenges for people to address, both in the near term and into the future. The fireworks industry relies on many types of experts, says Grucci.

            "Sunscreen protects us from blistering solar rays. However, concerns about the environmental safety of some ingredients lead some people to seek alternatives to mineral sunscreens. Fruits \u2014 such as bananas \u2014 have natural, light-filtering chemicals that may lead to eco-friendlier sunscreens.",
            "Columbus, Ohio \u2014 Bananas grow best in full sun. To protect their sensitive skins from damaging ultraviolet rays, banana peels produce a natural sunscreen. A teen has now peeled back the secrets of this natural sunblock. What she\u2019s found could lead to more eco-friendly sunscreens for all of us.",

            "fCTaylor Maguire investigated how banana peels might lead to more eco-friendly sunscreens.",
            "\u201cMy mom always raised me to pay attention to the ingredients in my cosmetics,\u201d says Taylor Maguire, 15. She prefers \u201corganic products over synthetic ones.\u201d That led this sophomore at Garden City High School in New York to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in my sunscreen?\u201d",
            "These products protect our skin against blistering solar rays. But their use comes at a price. Some of sunscreen\u2019s chemicals may cause cancer, Taylor notes. And when these chemicals wash into our environment, they can hurt animals. For example, some mineral sunscreens interfere with the ability of freshwater animals to navigate. High enough exposures, she says, can kill some organisms.",
            "So, Taylor looked for alternatives to mineral-based sunscreens.\u00a0",
            "Bananas can naturally filter out much of the sun\u2019s more damaging rays. Could their natural sunblock replace mineral sunscreens? Taylor investigated. And what she found out won her a spot here in May at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF.",
            "Bananas tend to grow in a \u201cUV-intense environment,\u201d Taylor says. UV \u2014 short for ultraviolet \u2014 is a band of light wavelengths. This high-energy light is invisible to the human eye. But it causes most of the sun\u2019s damage to our skin. For a sunscreen to work, it must protect against certain UV rays.",
            "Taylor had reasoned that bananas \u201cmust have their own mechanism.\u201d After all, they grow near the equator. That\u2019s where UV exposures are strongest.",
            "Plants typically make flavonoids \u2014 pigments that come in a rainbow of colors \u2014 as a defense against the sun\u2019s UV. Taylor wondered if banana flavonoids might work to protect our skin from UV, too.",
            "She wasn\u2019t sure exactly which bananas flavonoids to use. Taylor heated, froze and blended the outer layer of a banana peel. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s exposed to the sunlight,\u201d she explains. Any UV-filtering chemicals likely lie there.",
            "Breaking open the cells released many of their chemicals. From this soup she made two extracts. One of these contained only components that would dissolve in water. That was her aqueous extract. The other contained only chemicals that wouldn\u2019t dissolve in water. That was her nonpolar extract. Nonpolar chemicals dissolve in oil rather than water.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A sunscreen must absorb UV light before it reaches your skin. And the more it absorbs, the better. To test how well each extract could do that, Taylor turned to a light-measuring tool. Called a spectrophotometer, it measures how much of any color of light a liquid absorbs.",
            "The tool confirmed that both of her banana extracts absorbed UV light. But the nonpolar one went a step further. It absorbed the full range of UV wavelengths \u2014 and especially the most damaging ones. They belong to a part of the UV spectrum called UV-A.",
            "Would banana-based sunscreens also be safe for the environment? After all, Taylor says, typical drug-store sunscreens can harm aquatic life. To find out, she recruited planarians (Girardia tigrina) as her \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d Planarians are a type of flatworm that live in water. They\u2019re often used in drug-safety studies, Taylor explains. A chemical that harms these worms might also pose a risk to other aquatic animals.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!5",
            "fCTaylor created two banana-extract solutions \u2014 one nonpolar and one aqueous. She also created mineral-sunscreen solutions for comparison. Spectrophotometry allowed her to test wavelengths of light absorbed by each sample. She also used a microscope to observe planarians\u2019 locomotion \u2014 or movement \u2014 when exposed to UV light.",
            "The plan was to put planarians into dishes with different extracts and expose them to strong UV light for 10 minutes. If the worm\u2019s movement slowed or stopped, she took that to mean the light damaged them. Her five test solutions included her two extracts, a drugstore sunscreen solution, plain water and glycerol.",
            "Why glycerol? The nonpolar extract and sunscreen solution both contained this thick liquid. Taylor tested glycerol by itself to check if it caused problems on its own.",
            "And it did. \u201cThe nonpolar banana, the glycerol and the mineral sunscreen [appeared] fatal\u201d to the worms, she found. \u201cThey stopped moving.\u201d",
            "That \u201cwas surprising,\u201d Taylor says. Glycerol \u201cis actually an ingredient found in a lot of sunscreens,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not known to hurt people. But she\u2019s \u201cpretty sure\u201d it killed her planarians.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!6",
            "fCTaylor used these peels to create her banana extracts.",
            "In a later test, Taylor would notice that glycerol damaged planarians\u2019 skin \u2014 even with no UV exposure. Glycerol is used in many products. Taylor\u2019s work now suggests it might pose risks to aquatic life.",
            "But planarians survived just fine in the aqueous extract. And these outperformed the water-only group \u2014 the only other ones left alive, the teen says.",
            "Taylor confirmed this later when she stained those same planarians. She used a special dye. It stains damaged tissue so that it glows under her microscope\u2019s UV light. Basically, the more glow, the more damage there is.",
            "The three glycerol-exposed groups exhibited the most damage. The aqueous extract group showed the least. Where damage did show up, Taylor says, it looked \u201cspotty.\u201d That probably means a worm \u201cwas not fully coated.\u201d",
            "The next step is figuring out exactly what chemical provided the aqueous extract\u2019s UV protection. Identifying that, she says, could allow for a new class of eco-friendly, banana-based sunscreens.",
            "Regeneron ISEF is a program created and run by the Society of Science (which also publishes this magazine). Taylor was among 1,657 students \u2014 from 62 nations or territories \u2014 competing at the 75th annual ISEF. They shared in nearly $9 million in prizes."

In this way, it altered the fish\u2019s path. There\u2019s little evidence that narwhals normally eat much char. And winter, not summer, is their big dining season. So this video seems to show the whale and fish investigating one another.",

The third group experienced rapid finger motion, but all the fingers moved at once. Two other groups didn\u2019t use the robo-hand. One of these continued to practice the tricky pattern on their own. The final group just rested.",

These connections could help explain why the training improved the musicians\u2019 speed in their left hands, even though they only wore the device on their right.",
            "Doctors and researchers already use robotic devices similar to this one in therapy, notes Hatsopoulos. For example, a stroke often impairs movement on one side of the body. Using a robot to move an arm can help a patient get back their former range of motion.",

            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

Although these stress responses may not feel good, they are totally normal. They\u2019re your body\u2019s way of sharpening your focus and boosting the energy you have to help you perform well.\u00a0",
            "When we encounter a big challenge or risk \u2014 or become overly excited \u2014 our body responds in a way to keep us safe. We\u2019re hardwired for this. These changes supercharge how our body functions.",
            "An increased heart rate and breathing will send more oxygen to our muscles and brain. Our muscles tense so they can react quickly. By sweating, our body attempts to avoid overheating. Our pupils enlarge so we become more aware of our surroundings. And our body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, to boost our energy and focus.",
            "Together, these changes are known as the fight-or-flight response. They\u2019re automatically triggered by what\u2019s known as the sympathetic nervous system.

Particles with different spins interact with matter and magnetic fields in different ways.",

            "In cities that no longer add fluoride to drinking water, children experience more tooth decay, studies show.",
            "Warren Loeppky has been a kids\u2019 dentist for 20 years. Over the last decade, he\u2019s been seeing more tooth decay in his young patients. Not only is it more common, he says, but also more aggressive and severe. Many kids have so much damage that he has to put them under general anesthesia to repair their teeth.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s always sad seeing a young child in pain,\u201d Loeppky says. \u201cDental decay is very preventable. It breaks your heart to see these young kids that aren\u2019t able to eat.\u201d",
            "Many things can foster tooth decay. Diet and genetics can both play a role, Loeppky notes. Still, he believes part of the problem stems from a decision made in Calgary, where he works. In 2011, this Canadian city stopped adding fluoride to its drinking water.",
            "The decision \u201cwas surprising to the general public,\u201d says Juliet Guichon. But it was \u201cshocking and alarming to dentists, to pediatricians, to anesthesiologists and others in the healthcare field,\u201d she says. They \u201cknew what it would mean\u201d for children\u2019s health. Guichon is a legal and ethics scholar at the University of Calgary. She formed a group that pushed for putting fluoride back in the city\u2019s tap water.",
            "Fluoride is a mineral. Soil, water and many foods naturally contain low levels of it. It offers a safe and effective way to prevent tooth decay, studies have shown. It recruits other minerals, such as calcium and phosphate, to teeth. They strengthen a tooth\u2019s enamel, which fends off the acid made by mouth bacteria. Dental health can have a big effect on someone\u2019s overall health. That\u2019s why fluoride is added to toothpaste and other oral-care products.",
            "*a_girl_in_a_bathroom_squeezing_toothpaste_--_likely_containing_fluoride_--_onto_a_toothbrush",
            "fCStudies have shown that fluoride strengthens tooth enamel and helps prevent tooth decay. This is why it\u2019s found in toothpaste, mouthwash and many other oral-care products.",
            "Many people also get fluoride from tap water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that communities add 0.7 milligrams of it for every liter of water. It\u2019s up to state and local governments to decide if they want to follow that guidance. In 2022, the CDC reported that nearly two in every three Americans received fluoridated water.",
            "But this water treatment practice is coming under new scrutiny.",
            "In March, Utah became the first state to ban water fluoridation. Florida followed suit in May. Many cities and towns across the country are considering it. And on April 7, one federal official said he would tell the CDC to stop recommending this water treatment.",
            "To understand the impacts of such a move, some researchers have studied public health effects in places that no longer add fluoride to water. Calgary is one such city. Juneau, Alaska, is another. It stopped this water treatment in 2007.",
            "The data may offer a cautionary tale for other cities and towns. Science News spoke with researchers and other experts in both cities. They described what can happen when local governments opt to stop adding fluoride to drinking water.",
            "Lindsay McLaren says she never expected to end up studying fluoride. At the University of Calgary, she studies how public policies can affect people\u2019s health. She hadn\u2019t thought much about fluoridation \u2014 until 2011. That\u2019s when the Calgary City Council decided to stop adding fluoride to the city\u2019s water.",
            "The move gave McLaren an idea for a study. She\u2019d look at how the dental health of local children fared once fluoride was gone.",
            "She recruited dental hygienists to inspect the mouths of second-graders. Some went to schools in Calgary. Others went to schools in Edmonton. It\u2019s a city in the same province that\u2019s roughly the same size. And it still added fluoride to its water.",
            "In Calgary, the team surveyed second-graders about seven years after water fluoridation had ended. So these kids likely had never been exposed to fluoride in their drinking water. Of 2,649 children, 65 percent had tooth decay. That\u2019s nearly two in every three. In Edmonton, 55 percent of the 2,600 surveyed children had tooth decay.",
            "On a population level, that difference is \u201cquite large,\u201d McLaren says.",
            "\u201cCompared to Edmonton kids, Calgary kids were now considerably worse as far as dental health goes,\u201d McLaren says. Her team looked at other factors, such as diet, social measures and family income. But none of these, she says, could explain the differences between dental health in the two cities\u2019 kids.",
            "And the number of kids with decay wasn\u2019t the only difference. More kids treated for tooth decay-related problems had to be placed under general anesthesia in Calgary than in Edmonton. That finding comes from an April 2024 study in the Canadian Journal of Public Health. It suggests the decay in these kids may have been more severe or extensive. From 2018 to 2019, 32 out of every 10,000 children in Calgary were put under general anesthesia to treat tooth decay. In Edmonton, it was roughly half as many.",
            "The findings don\u2019t surprise local dentists, says Bruce Yaholnitsky. He specializes in gum disease and other mouth issues in Calgary. \u201cThis is just obvious to us. But you need to have proper science to prove, in some cases, the obvious.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/TyVV0UDQ_f4?feature=oembed",
            "Juneau, Alaska\u2019s capital, showed similar signs of fluoride\u2019s value.",
            "Jennifer Meyer moved to the city in 2015. At the time, she had two young children. Her third was born in Juneau. She was surprised at how\u00a0many fillings and other dental work other young kids seemed to have.",
            "\u201cI thought \u2018Wow, what\u2019s going on here?\u2019 Because I could see a lot of the decay and the repairs,\u201d Meyer says.",
            "Meyer is a public health researcher at the University of Alaska Anchorage. She wondered whether a lack of fluoride might be playing some role.",
            "Before Juneau voted to stop adding fluoride to its water, a six-member commission had reviewed evidence on the value of fluoride. Meyer got a copy of the commission\u2019s report. In it, two commission members opposed to fluoridation made some claims about its risks. Meyer says those claims were \u201cfalse\u201d and not based on \u201cquality\u201d research.",
            "The commission\u2019s chair criticized anti-fluoride positions. At one point, he wrote that part of the cited research was \u201cjunk science.\u201d But in the end, he still recommended that the city stop adding fluoride to its water. He claimed the evidence about the safety of low levels of fluoride was not conclusive. That left the commission\u2019s members split at 3\u20133.",
            "Afterward, the Juneau Assembly voted to end fluoridation. The practice ended in 2007.",
            "Meyer\u2019s team pored over records from a government program called Medicaid. It helps cover the costs of health-care treatments for people with limited income.",
            "The team compared dental claims made before and after the city stopped using fluoride. They found a big effect on children under age 6. In 2003, when fluoride was still present, these kids had an average of 1.5 procedures to treat tooth decay. In 2012, five years after fluoride use stopped, this number had risen to 2.5 treatments per child.",
            "These extra treatments come at a steep price. The cost, when adjusted for inflation, jumped by an average of $303 per child from 2003 to 2012.",
            "Who ends up paying those higher costs? Taxpayers, Meyer says.",
            "\u201cWhen politicians decide to withhold a safe and effective public health intervention like fluoridation, they are imposing a hidden health care tax on everyone in their state or community,\u201d Meyer says.",
            "*a_young_man_wearing_a_baseball_cap_backwards_beding_over_a_water_fountain_to_drinik",
            "fCMore than 60 percent of Americans had access to public tap water with fluoride in 2022. Many places are now questioning whether to continue adding fluoride to water.",
            "Today, many who oppose fluoride in water point to a review published last August. It was released by the National Toxicology Program. This U.S. program evaluates the health effects of substances.",
            "That 2024 review has proven controversial. It concluded with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water was correlated \u2014 or linked \u2014 with lower IQs in children.",
            "One reason why that statement was controversial: That dose is more than double what the CDC recommends adding to water.",
            "And authors of this review couldn\u2019t tell if lower levels \u2014 like those found in treated U.S. drinking water \u2014 affect kids\u2019 IQ. Plus, that correlation is not causation. Seeing a lowered IQ does not prove that higher levels of fluoride caused it. Indeed, that warning is noted on the program\u2019s website.",
            "Meyer cautions against making decisions \u201cbased on weak or misrepresented evidence.\u201d Choosing to stop adding fluoride, she says, \u201cis not a precaution, it\u2019s negligence.\u201d",
            "Juneau still doesn\u2019t add fluoride to its water. But in 2021, 62 percent of Calgary residents voted to bring it back. That\u2019s more than voted in 1989 to first put fluoride in Calgary\u2019s water. Legal scholar Guichon says McLaren\u2019s study helped get people to vote for it.",
            "\u201cMore people voted to reinstate fluoride than voted for the mayor. So that\u2019s a success,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cBut in America, we are entering a dark time.\u201d"

            "Some vaccines, such as flu shots, contain killed versions of disease-causing microbes. Others, including vaccines against measles and smallpox, contain weakened forms of germs. Still others, including COVID-19 vaccines, contain instructions for the body to briefly make proteins typically made by a pathogen. Each of those options offers the body a small \u2014 but safe \u2014 sample of what a dangerous germ might look like.",
            "When the body detects those intruders, the immune system launches a response. It sends its own proteins, called antibodies, to fend off the invaders. This is basically a dress rehearsal for how to fight off the disease. That way, if someone is ever exposed to a real, live form of the germ, their body already knows how to defend itself.",
            "But vaccines don\u2019t just protect those who have gotten vaccinated. The more people who get vaccinated, the fewer people can spread the disease. That helps shield those who can\u2019t get vaccinated, such as babies and cancer patients, from infection.",
