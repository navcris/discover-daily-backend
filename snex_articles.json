This bone collector caterpillar chows down for months until it\u2019s ready to turn into a moth. Then, its gruesome coating becomes its cocoon.",
            "A severed ant head. A fly wing. A beetle abdomen. These body parts ripped from dead insects adorn a caterpillar\u2019s protective coat. That\u2019s why scientists are calling this newfound species the \u201cbone collector.\u201d",
            "This caterpillar sports remains of prey as camouflage while it searches spider webs for trapped bugs. The meat-eating caterpillar was found on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. It is the first known by scientists not only to live in spider hunting grounds but also to fully decorate itself with body parts.",
            "Researchers described the caterpillar April 25 in Science.",
            "Relatively few caterpillars eat meat. Of nearly 200,000 known moth and butterfly species, only about 300 types are carnivorous. The bone collector caterpillar belongs to the moth genus Hyposmocoma. They are native to the Hawaiian Islands. All members wear protective coats when young.

This short, double-speed video shows it eating another of its species.",
            "While walking in the Waianae Mountains almost 20 years ago, some scientists spied an odd caterpillar next to a spider web in a tree hole. \u201cIt [was] covered in little bits of bug,\u201d recalls Dan Rubinoff. He works for the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa in Honolulu. As an entomologist, he studies insects.",
            "At first, he had dismissed that caterpillar as a curiosity. But over time, he kept crossing paths with more weird caterpillars. Over the next two decades, he and others spotted 62 of these bone-collector caterpillars. All were within a 15-square-kilometer (almost 6-square-mile) range.",
            "Each lived in a spider web tucked away in a tree, log or rock cavity. And there was never more than one per web (otherwise one would eat the other). The caterpillar lurks in a web, waiting to prey on insects stuck there. The caterpillar masks its scent and texture with leftovers from prey on which the spider had dined. The caterpillar even wears skin shed by its eight-legged landlord.",

            "When assembling its prey-based wardrobe, a caterpillar carefully probes and rotates those bodily remains. The carnivorous critter first nibbles large pieces down to size. Then, it weaves them onto its silken case. After a few months of feasting, the caterpillar seals off the open end of its case. Now, that case will become its cocoon as the caterpillar transforms into a moth.",
            "Scientists analyzed the bone collector moth\u2019s genes. They found that its lineage is at least 6 million years old. That\u2019s even older than the island of Oahu! So this critter\u2019s ancestors may have originated on a different island. Other Hyposmocoma moths are represented by multiple species on several of the Hawaiian Islands. But the bone collector is the only species in its line, Rubinoff says.",

She prefers \u201corganic products over synthetic ones.\u201d That led this sophomore at Garden City High School in New York to ask: \u201cWhat\u2019s in my sunscreen?\u201d",
            "These products protect our skin against blistering solar rays. But their use comes at a price. Some of sunscreen\u2019s chemicals may cause cancer, Taylor notes. And when these chemicals wash into our environment, they can hurt animals. For example, some mineral sunscreens interfere with the ability of freshwater animals to navigate. High enough exposures, she says, can kill some organisms.",
            "So, Taylor looked for alternatives to mineral-based sunscreens.\u00a0",
            "Bananas can naturally filter out much of the sun\u2019s more damaging rays. Could their natural sunblock replace mineral sunscreens? Taylor investigated. And what she found out won her a spot here in May at the 2025 Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF.",
            "Bananas tend to grow in a \u201cUV-intense environment,\u201d Taylor says. UV \u2014 short for ultraviolet \u2014 is a band of light wavelengths. This high-energy light is invisible to the human eye. But it causes most of the sun\u2019s damage to our skin. For a sunscreen to work, it must protect against certain UV rays.",
            "Taylor had reasoned that bananas \u201cmust have their own mechanism.\u201d After all, they grow near the equator. That\u2019s where UV exposures are strongest.",
            "Plants typically make flavonoids \u2014 pigments that come in a rainbow of colors \u2014 as a defense against the sun\u2019s UV. Taylor wondered if banana flavonoids might work to protect our skin from UV, too.",
            "She wasn\u2019t sure exactly which bananas flavonoids to use. Taylor heated, froze and blended the outer layer of a banana peel. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that\u2019s exposed to the sunlight,\u201d she explains. Any UV-filtering chemicals likely lie there.",
            "Breaking open the cells released many of their chemicals. From this soup she made two extracts. One of these contained only components that would dissolve in water. That was her aqueous extract. The other contained only chemicals that wouldn\u2019t dissolve in water. That was her nonpolar extract. Nonpolar chemicals dissolve in oil rather than water.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "A sunscreen must absorb UV light before it reaches your skin. And the more it absorbs, the better. To test how well each extract could do that, Taylor turned to a light-measuring tool. Called a spectrophotometer, it measures how much of any color of light a liquid absorbs.",
            "The tool confirmed that both of her banana extracts absorbed UV light. But the nonpolar one went a step further. It absorbed the full range of UV wavelengths \u2014 and especially the most damaging ones. They belong to a part of the UV spectrum called UV-A.",
            "Would banana-based sunscreens also be safe for the environment? After all, Taylor says, typical drug-store sunscreens can harm aquatic life. To find out, she recruited planarians (Girardia tigrina) as her \u201cguinea pigs.\u201d Planarians are a type of flatworm that live in water. They\u2019re often used in drug-safety studies, Taylor explains. A chemical that harms these worms might also pose a risk to other aquatic animals.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!1",
            "fCTaylor created two banana-extract solutions \u2014 one nonpolar and one aqueous. She also created mineral-sunscreen solutions for comparison. Spectrophotometry allowed her to test wavelengths of light absorbed by each sample. She also used a microscope to observe planarians\u2019 locomotion \u2014 or movement \u2014 when exposed to UV light.",
            "The plan was to put planarians into dishes with different extracts and expose them to strong UV light for 10 minutes. If the worm\u2019s movement slowed or stopped, she took that to mean the light damaged them. Her five test solutions included her two extracts, a drugstore sunscreen solution, plain water and glycerol.",
            "Why glycerol? The nonpolar extract and sunscreen solution both contained this thick liquid. Taylor tested glycerol by itself to check if it caused problems on its own.",
            "And it did. \u201cThe nonpolar banana, the glycerol and the mineral sunscreen [appeared] fatal\u201d to the worms, she found. \u201cThey stopped moving.\u201d",
            "That \u201cwas surprising,\u201d Taylor says. Glycerol \u201cis actually an ingredient found in a lot of sunscreens,\u201d she says. It\u2019s not known to hurt people. But she\u2019s \u201cpretty sure\u201d it killed her planarians.",
            "*_Eco-friendly_sunscreen_That\u2019s_bananas!2",
            "fCTaylor used these peels to create her banana extracts.",
            "In a later test, Taylor would notice that glycerol damaged planarians\u2019 skin \u2014 even with no UV exposure. Glycerol is used in many products. Taylor\u2019s work now suggests it might pose risks to aquatic life.",
            "But planarians survived just fine in the aqueous extract. And these outperformed the water-only group \u2014 the only other ones left alive, the teen says.",
            "Taylor confirmed this later when she stained those same planarians. She used a special dye. It stains damaged tissue so that it glows under her microscope\u2019s UV light. Basically, the more glow, the more damage there is.",
            "The three glycerol-exposed groups exhibited the most damage. The aqueous extract group showed the least. Where damage did show up, Taylor says, it looked \u201cspotty.\u201d That probably means a worm \u201cwas not fully coated.\u201d",
            "The next step is figuring out exactly what chemical provided the aqueous extract\u2019s UV protection. Identifying that, she says, could allow for a new class of eco-friendly, banana-based sunscreens.",
            "Regeneron ISEF is a program created and run by the Society of Science (which also publishes this magazine). Taylor was among 1,657 students \u2014 from 62 nations or territories \u2014 competing at the 75th annual ISEF. They shared in nearly $9 million in prizes."

When these ticks bite, the sugar molecule and other compounds can get into someone\u2019s body. There, they can somehow make the immune systems go haywire.",
            "The next exposure to alpha-gal may trigger an allergic reaction in these people. Red meats and other animal products (such as milk and gelatin) are rich in alpha-gal. So those foods could incite that bad reaction.",

Quickly finding and removing those tiny arachnids can keep them from spreading diseases. That\u2019s the case for Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. A tick must latch onto someone\u2019s body for hours or days to transmit the bacteria that cause those illnesses.",

Not only is it more common, he says, but also more aggressive and severe. Many kids have so much damage that he has to put them under general anesthesia to repair their teeth.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s always sad seeing a young child in pain,\u201d Loeppky says. \u201cDental decay is very preventable. It breaks your heart to see these young kids that aren\u2019t able to eat.\u201d",
            "Many things can foster tooth decay. Diet and genetics can both play a role, Loeppky notes. Still, he believes part of the problem stems from a decision made in Calgary, where he works. In 2011, this Canadian city stopped adding fluoride to its drinking water.",
            "The decision \u201cwas surprising to the general public,\u201d says Juliet Guichon.

It recruits other minerals, such as calcium and phosphate, to teeth. They strengthen a tooth\u2019s enamel, which fends off the acid made by mouth bacteria. Dental health can have a big effect on someone\u2019s overall health. That\u2019s why fluoride is added to toothpaste and other oral-care products.",

            "Lindsay McLaren says she never expected to end up studying fluoride. At the University of Calgary, she studies how public policies can affect people\u2019s health. She hadn\u2019t thought much about fluoridation \u2014 until 2011. That\u2019s when the Calgary City Council decided to stop adding fluoride to the city\u2019s water.",
            "The move gave McLaren an idea for a study. She\u2019d look at how the dental health of local children fared once fluoride was gone.",
            "She recruited dental hygienists to inspect the mouths of second-graders. Some went to schools in Calgary. Others went to schools in Edmonton. It\u2019s a city in the same province that\u2019s roughly the same size. And it still added fluoride to its water.",
            "In Calgary, the team surveyed second-graders about seven years after water fluoridation had ended. So these kids likely had never been exposed to fluoride in their drinking water. Of 2,649 children, 65 percent had tooth decay. That\u2019s nearly two in every three. In Edmonton, 55 percent of the 2,600 surveyed children had tooth decay.",
            "On a population level, that difference is \u201cquite large,\u201d McLaren says.",
            "\u201cCompared to Edmonton kids, Calgary kids were now considerably worse as far as dental health goes,\u201d McLaren says. Her team looked at other factors, such as diet, social measures and family income. But none of these, she says, could explain the differences between dental health in the two cities\u2019 kids.",
            "And the number of kids with decay wasn\u2019t the only difference. More kids treated for tooth decay-related problems had to be placed under general anesthesia in Calgary than in Edmonton. That finding comes from an April 2024 study in the Canadian Journal of Public Health. It suggests the decay in these kids may have been more severe or extensive. From 2018 to 2019, 32 out of every 10,000 children in Calgary were put under general anesthesia to treat tooth decay. In Edmonton, it was roughly half as many.",
            "The findings don\u2019t surprise local dentists, says Bruce Yaholnitsky. He specializes in gum disease and other mouth issues in Calgary. \u201cThis is just obvious to us. But you need to have proper science to prove, in some cases, the obvious.\u201d",

At one point, he wrote that part of the cited research was \u201cjunk science.\u201d But in the end, he still recommended that the city stop adding fluoride to its water. He claimed the evidence about the safety of low levels of fluoride was not conclusive. That left the commission\u2019s members split at 3\u20133.",
            "Afterward, the Juneau Assembly voted to end fluoridation. The practice ended in 2007.",
            "Meyer\u2019s team pored over records from a government program called Medicaid. It helps cover the costs of health-care treatments for people with limited income.",
            "The team compared dental claims made before and after the city stopped using fluoride. They found a big effect on children under age 6. In 2003, when fluoride was still present, these kids had an average of 1.5 procedures to treat tooth decay. In 2012, five years after fluoride use stopped, this number had risen to 2.5 treatments per child.",

Seeing a lowered IQ does not prove that higher levels of fluoride caused it. Indeed, that warning is noted on the program\u2019s website.",
            "Meyer cautions against making decisions \u201cbased on weak or misrepresented evidence.\u201d Choosing to stop adding fluoride, she says, \u201cis not a precaution, it\u2019s negligence.\u201d",
            "Juneau still doesn\u2019t add fluoride to its water. But in 2021, 62 percent of Calgary residents voted to bring it back. That\u2019s more than voted in 1989 to first put fluoride in Calgary\u2019s water. Legal scholar Guichon says McLaren\u2019s study helped get people to vote for it.",
            "\u201cMore people voted to reinstate fluoride than voted for the mayor. So that\u2019s a success,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cBut in America, we are entering a dark time.\u201d"

Yellowstone\u2019s volcanic activity started about 1.2 million years ago. Over time, multiple vent-like eruptions created a vast caldera system throughout the region. The last eruption occurred about 600,000 years ago. Geologists think this one was massive. It emptied the caldera\u2019s magma chamber. Without magma to support it, the ground caved in. That created Yellowstone\u2019s largest caldera, which stretches 113 kilometers (70 miles) across.",
            "Another famous caldera is Crater Lake, in Oregon. It formed about 7,700 years ago. The Native American Klamath Tribes lived in this region at the time. Their legends describe the event. The stories tell of fire and rock bursting from the ground. Landslides followed. Finally, Mount Mazama caved into the void below. Over time, the caldera filled with rainwater. That\u2019s why today, it is a lake. Crater Lake remains a sacred place to these tribes.",

It\u2019s so scary that some people instead call it \u201cthe C-word.\u201d There are more than 200 types of cancer. No two are exactly alike. Some still baffle doctors and scientists while others can be treated and even cured.",
            "Our cells are supposed to grow and divide. Without more cells, our bodies couldn\u2019t develop, and some parts would wear out.",
            "Cells divide as we shed skin and grow hair. Dividing cells keep our stomach lining working and replenish our blood. Cells grow to make our muscles bigger and bones longer.",
            "Cells usually keep this growth and division under tight control. But if those controls fail, a cell can begin to divide rapidly. And the new cells can do the same.

            "To make sure such errors get corrected, the cell has DNA repair genes. These produce molecules that run along the DNA, repairing mutations. Most times, a cell repairs the spelling errors. Other times, the body\u2019s immune system may find this cell and kill it.

For instance, exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays can cause DNA mutations. So can inhaling the smoke from cigarettes. Factors that trigger mutations raise the risk of developing cancer.

If doctors catch a cancerous tumor before its cells start spreading to other parts of the body, they can remove it. Common solid cancers include breast cancer, skin cancer and lung cancer.",

Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",

But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed.

Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise.

            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

In people, that diversity helps to limit health problems. Some hospitals with low microbial diversity show a higher risk of infections. Microbes in your home can affect health, too.

            "Doctors and researchers already use robotic devices similar to this one in therapy, notes Hatsopoulos. For example, a stroke often impairs movement on one side of the body. Using a robot to move an arm can help a patient get back their former range of motion.",

            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

Our pupils enlarge so we become more aware of our surroundings. And our body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, to boost our energy and focus.",

            "Min\u00e8re first got curious about sugar cravings while working with mice in another experiment. When the mice were full, she noticed, they wouldn\u2019t eat more of their normal food. But they would eat sugar \u2014 as do many people after a meal.",
            "\u201cThat really made us want to know what drives that extra sugar intake,\u201d she recalls. So Min\u00e8re\u2019s team designed another experiment with two groups of mice.",

            "In the morning, the researchers offered both groups of mice sugar. And all devoured it \u2014 even those that had just eaten. This confirmed that even when full, mice crave sugar.",

            "They inserted special proteins into a few parts of the animals\u2019 brains. These proteins glow when brain cells are active. To detect that glow, the scientists also implanted a light-recording device into each mouse\u2019s brain.",
            "The researchers focused on a bundle of neurons called the POMC. It sits in a part of the brain that controls hunger, known as the hypothalamus. These cells are known to make mice \u2014 and people \u2014 feel full. The team wondered if the same cells might help drive sugar cravings.",
            "When an animal eats, POMC neurons kick off a cascade of activity. They send messages to other groups of brain cells that give a sense of feeling full. That feeling tells the animal to stop eating.",
            "When the mice were offered sugar, though, a different pathway out of the POMC lit up. \u201cWe found that the POMC neurons, which tell us how full we are, are also quickly turned on when [mice] see signs of sugar,\u201d says Min\u00e8re.",
            "This pathway, she believes, acts as a sugar-craving circuit. It can override the fullness circuit. The sugar-craving circuit engages a part of the brain that signals rewards and pleasure. This, the researchers think, is what makes sweets so appealing \u2014 even when we\u2019re full.",

As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",

            "Many vaccines today, such as flu shots, are delivered by injection. But in the future, vaccines might instead be delivered by puffs of air or pain-free patches.  ",
            "Vaccines have made the world a much safer place \u2014 especially for children.",
            "Before vaccines, many kids suffered from debilitating or deadly infections. Such horrible illnesses included measles, polio and smallpox. Now, vaccines have wiped out \u2014 or nearly wiped out \u2014 those diseases from many parts of the world.",
            "In fact, scientists reported last year that vaccines have saved some 154 million lives in the last 50 years. About 146 million of those saved were children under age five.",
            "Vaccines help protect people from disease by training the body\u2019s immune system to fight off harmful pathogens.",
            "Some vaccines, such as flu shots, contain killed versions of disease-causing microbes. Others, including vaccines against measles and smallpox, contain weakened forms of germs. Still others, including COVID-19 vaccines, contain instructions for the body to briefly make proteins typically made by a pathogen. Each of those options offers the body a small \u2014 but safe \u2014 sample of what a dangerous germ might look like.",
            "When the body detects those intruders, the immune system launches a response. It sends its own proteins, called antibodies, to fend off the invaders. This is basically a dress rehearsal for how to fight off the disease. That way, if someone is ever exposed to a real, live form of the germ, their body already knows how to defend itself.",
            "But vaccines don\u2019t just protect those who have gotten vaccinated. The more people who get vaccinated, the fewer people can spread the disease. That helps shield those who can\u2019t get vaccinated, such as babies and cancer patients, from infection.",
            "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, recommend vaccines for more than a dozen deadly illnesses. Measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis and the flu are just a few examples. You can get some vaccines through nasal sprays. Others have to be given through shots. (Engineers are working on ways to deliver vaccines through puffs of air or skin patches as alternatives to shots.)",
            "Vaccines are safe and life-saving medical treatments. Yet vaccination rates in the United States have been falling. With fewer people vaccinated, it will become easier for deadly infectious diseases rear their ugly heads once again. We\u2019ve already seen this happen with a major measles outbreak in Texas this year.\u00a0",
