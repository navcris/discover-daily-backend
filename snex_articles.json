            "Paula Kirya at the University of California, San Diego holds a morpho butterfly wing. She used what she learned about how it gets its blue hue to pioneer a new way to study cancer and other diseases.",
            "The morpho butterfly is a flying marvel. It flits through the rainforests of Central and South America. With wings that can span 20 centimeters (8 inches), it can be bigger than most human hands. Those wings shimmer with a dazzling blue hue. New data show these butterfly wings could one day become the basis of a new medical tool \u2014 one that might help doctors investigate the development and severity of some cancers.",
            "Although this butterfly\u2019s wings are blue, that hue is not due to any pigment. Instead, it comes from how light reflects and refracts off tiny microstructures atop those wings. The shimmering color of the wing depends on how light hits it. (Many materials, from rocks to plastic wrap, have this property, called structural color.)",
            "Researchers at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) have now shown how those microstructures can provide a new view on biological tissue.",
            "The method they devised was simple. They placed a morpho wing on one microscope slide. Then they placed a thin slice of tissue on a second slide. After lining up the two, they turned on a special kind of light. This polarized light went through both the wing and the tissue beneath it. The light reflected back and passed through both again.",
            "*a_microscopic_view_of_bright_blue_butterfly_scales_",
            "fCThe wing of a morpho butterfly, seen here at 100x magnification, has tiny microstructures that give it a vivid blue hue. ",
            "This process can reveal alterations in the structural fibers that make up certain tissues. These are called fibrotic changes. And they can help researchers diagnose or study many diseases.",
            "The UCSD team described its new technique in the January 15 Advanced Materials. It can spot changes in fibrous tissue that may signal breast cancer \u2014 and whether that cancer is getting ready to spread.",
            "It\u2019s often hard to study fibrous tissues in a medical clinic, says Lisa Poulikakos. She\u2019s a materials scientist at UCSD. \u201cUsually,\u201d she explains, \u201cyou need those expensive optical machines that cost around $200,000.\u201d They\u2019re not available to many doctors. Plus, she adds, looking for microstructural changes in tissue often requires first staining or dyeing it. But those processes change the tissue itself. The dyes also break down with time.",
            "This new technique is a simpler and less expensive way to diagnose the fibrous nature of cancer tissue, she says. It requires only a microscope and one morpho wing. And the only thing that hits the tissue, she notes, is light.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The method came about because two scientists happened to be in the right place at the right time. Poulikakos was one of them. The other was Paula Kirya. This graduate student had just come to study at UCSD.",
            "\u201cDr. Poulikakos was maybe the first person I met in San Diego,\u201d says Kirya. \u201cShe let me join her lab very quickly.\u201d In that lab, scientists study how light interacts with materials.",
            "This team knew that fibrous tissue reflects light in unusual ways. They also knew that etching marks into a material could make it reflect different colors of light in different directions. They wanted to combine these two ideas to create a tool that would more accurately reveal how fibrous some tissue might have become.",
            "When Kirya visited the lab, a student told her they were having trouble reflecting blue light. At once, something clicked in Kirya\u2019s mind. She went to Poulikakos and said: \u201cIf this is what we\u2019re trying to do, we could just look at the morpho butterfly and see these features.\u201d",
            "For two years before she came to UCSD, Kirya had been studying the blue morpho butterfly. She knew its wings\u2019 deep hue doesn\u2019t come from any natural dye or other chemical. Instead, it shimmers blue thanks to how tiny structures on its surface manipulate light.",
            "fC",
            "Poulikakos was delighted at Kirya\u2019s idea \u2014 and the new project was born.",
            "Kirya bought a single morpho wing for about $8 in a local store. \u201cThey gave us a discount,\u201d she says. \u201cMost insect collectors want pristine insects. We just wanted the wing.\u201d Then she began experimenting with ways to combine samples of tumor tissue and this wing.",
            "By rotating the tissue and wing together under a microscope, the scientists quickly found they could see the thick fibers associated with cancer.",
            "Their method didn\u2019t require any costly materials. Best of all? It needed no stain or dye. In fact, this is one major advantage of the new method, says Vance Williams. A materials scientist, Williams works at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada.",
            "\u201cThe material itself doesn\u2019t absorb light. And it\u2019s not using dye that tends to fade over time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just all weird optical effects.\u201d",
            "Plus, Kirya notes, a single wing can be used again and again for years.",
            "But this discovery was just the first step.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/sT7p4HAApJM?feature=oembed",
            "A material called collagen can help some cancerous tumors grow. High levels of collagen can be a sign of how likely a cancer is to spread. One way to measure collagen levels, new data show, is to see how polarized light reflects off fiber-like microstructures in the tissue.\u00a0 \u00a0",
            "Polarized light is made up of light waves that all vibrate in the same plane. When the direction of this light lines up with tiny structures on the morpho\u2019s wing, the light reflects brightly. The same thing happens for fibrous tissue, though less strongly.",
            "The UCSD team found that shining polarized light through both materials now strengthened the light signal from those fibers.",
            "\u201cThey\u2019re using some clever optics,\u201d Williams says, to make it \u201camplify a small signal.\u201d",
            "The light show put on by morpho butterfly wings shows up in other materials, too, he notes. (You can see much the same thing by looking through two polarizing lenses at stretched-out plastic wrap.) Williams designs materials with similar properties. They change color depending on how light strikes them.",
            "Kirya may be young, says Poulikakos, but \u201cshe\u2019s really a true scientist.\u201d She took detailed measurements of the fibrous tissues and the reflected light. Then she worked with other researchers to develop a computer model to turn those measurements into meaningful information about how advanced a breast cancer was. That\u2019s a gauge of how likely it is to spread and become lethal.",
            "Kirya suspects that her new technique could be most useful in parts of the world where scientists don\u2019t have access to expensive machines for diagnosing tissues. \u201cI had been looking at butterflies for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a dream of mine to apply that knowledge to real life. To a real-life problem.\u201d Now she has.",

            "Nucleosynthesis is a process by which new atomic nuclei are made. This process created all the elements that make up our universe.",
            "Synthesis is a fancy word meaning to create something. So nucleosynthesis means nuclei are being created. In this case, the nuclei are inside atoms. That\u2019s a big deal because an atom\u2019s nucleus determines which element it is. By making new nuclei, nucleosynthesis makes different elements, too.",
            "Nucleosynthesis works in one of two ways. It can start with protons and neutrons (or something even smaller) and bind them into a nucleus. Or it can start with a few lighter nuclei and fuse them into a heavier one.",
            "An atom\u2019s nucleus contains protons and neutrons. An atom\u2019s atomic number \u2014 the number of protons it contains \u2014 determines the element\u2019s identity. For example, all helium atoms have two protons. Helium\u2019s atomic number is 2. If an atom has two protons, it\u2019s a helium atom. If, by some process, a helium atom gains two more protons, it will no longer be helium. It would now be beryllium.",
            "This process doesn\u2019t always change the element. If only the number of neutrons in a nucleus changes, the element stays the same. That\u2019s because the number of protons, not neutrons, determines the element type.",
            "Most nucleosynthesis occurs in the cosmos. It started with the Big Bang, which exploded our universe into being. As matter and space rapidly expanded from the Big Bang, particles started to group together. Some of those particles were protons and neutrons. And in joining them together, the Big Bang created atomic nuclei. Scientists believe that lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, came from nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang.",
            "Other elements have been forged inside stars. During its lifetime, a star fuses lighter nuclei \u2014 such as hydrogen and helium \u2014 into heavier ones. The extreme gravity in the star\u2019s core drives this process. This is called stellar nucleosynthesis. This is where much of the carbon, iron and other elements crucial for life originate.",
            "Even in death, stars can form new elements. When supermassive stars die, they don\u2019t just fade away. They explode as a supernova. This releases huge amounts of energy. Enough energy to fuse nuclei together and create new elements. Scientists believe supernova nucleosynthesis made much of the oxygen in our universe. Supernovas likely cooked up most of the elements heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium, too.",

After an internship at a tech company making semiconductors, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. The Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago caught my eye. It\u2019s something that I really feel can change the world. I decided to go to a lab [run by Bozhi Tian] that worked with biointerface materials. These help seamlessly connect technology with the body. One example is the soft coatings on medical devices that make them safer and more comfortable.\u00a0One of the lab members was very good at heart surgery and experiments. Seeing his work made me interested in combining the engineering of materials with biology.\u00a0",

That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface.

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise.

            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",

You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",

But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",

But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better.

She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",

This stage can go on for weeks, months or longer.",

            "When someone claps their hands, a jet of air streams out of a gap where the hands meet. It goes between the thumb and forefinger. \u201cThis jet of air carries energy,\u201d explains Yicong Fu.

They described their findings February 12 in Nature. What they observed may also help scientists better understand worlds beyond Earth.",
            "Plastic ice is \u201csomething intermediate between a liquid and a crystal,\u201d explains Livia Bove. She\u2019s a physicist at CNRS in Paris. \u201cYou can imagine that it is softer when you squeeze it.\u201d It\u2019s called plastic ice because it is more easily molded or deformed than typical crystalline ice. Scientists refer to this Play-Doh-like trait as plasticity.",
            "Explains Bove, it\u2019s \u201clike something that can [squeeze] through a hole and come out, even if it\u2019s still solid.\u201d",
            "The molecules that make up ordinary ice sit in a hexagonal, honeycomb-like shape. Ice cubes, glaciers and snow contain this type of ice. It\u2019s formally known as ice Ih.",
            "In addition to Ih, there are at least 20 other known ice phases. They form under different conditions of pressure and temperature.",
            "At pressures above about 20,000 kilograms per square centimeter (285,466 pounds per square inch), ice smooshes into what\u2019s known as ice VII. It\u2019s densely packed molecules are ordered like the cubies in a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Ice VII has been found trapped in diamonds from Earth\u2019s mantle. It\u2019s also thought to occur inside other planets.\u00a0",
            "Some ice phases exist only in theory. They\u2019ve never been seen.",
            "More than 15 years ago, computer models predicted what would happen if ice VII were heated and put under extreme pressure. As in a liquid, its individual water molecules should start to rotate freely. Yet those molecules also should stay in one place \u2014 as in a solid.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",

            "For the new study, Bove was part of a team that used a relatively new tool. It can measure the motions of molecules under extreme pressures. It does this by shooting them with tiny particles called neutrons.",
            "Those neutrons interact with molecules in their samples. Depending on the molecules\u2019 motion, the neutrons gain or lose energy \u2014 then scatter away toward a detector. Measuring the scattered neutrons\u2019 energies allowed Bove\u2019s team to figure out how the ice molecules moved. From this, they could identify the ice phase that had formed.",
            "Above 177\u00b0 Celsius (350\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and at a pressure about 28 times that of the deepest point in Earth\u2019s oceans, Bove\u2019s team observed plastic ice VII. As expected, its structure formed a cubic-crystal lattice. And its molecules rotated about as fast as those in liquid water.",

            "However, one detail differed from what had been predicted. Rather than revolve freely, plastic ice VII\u2019s molecules appeared to swivel in jerky motions. As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux. He\u2019s a planetary scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Plastic ice VII could have formed then because water hadn\u2019t escaped yet from those moons\u2019 high-pressure interiors, he explains.",

            "It would be interesting to find out whether seafloor nutrients could move through plastic ice and into the oceans above, Journaux says. \u201cThat would actually feed the ocean with more nutrients.\u201d And those nutrients could make the oceans more habitable, he says.",
