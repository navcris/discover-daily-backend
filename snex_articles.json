            "Biologists estimate biodiversity a few different ways. One way is to count the number of species in a region. Scientists can also look at the members of a single species in a region. If the members of that species share similar genes, there is less diversity.",
            "In general, biodiversity increases as you approach the equator. That\u2019s because warm, wet climates allow more species to thrive. Tropical rainforests and coral reefs are near the equator. They are among the most diverse regions of the world.",

            "Some places naturally support fewer species. For example, the chilly Arctic is home to only about 21,000 species. Its biodiversity is much lower than the Amazon\u2019s.",
            "Ecosystems with more biodiversity tend to be more stable. Why? Think of it like this. Say an area has many kinds of plants and pollinators. If one type of plant dies out, most local pollinators will still have many other plants to feed on. But in an ecosystem with less biodiversity, losing one species can spell disaster for others that rely on it.",
            "Across the globe, biodiversity is decreasing. And the species that remain are losing numbers, too.\u00a0One leading cause is human activity. People have destroyed many species\u2019 habitats by turning land into roads, buildings and farms. Pollution, climate change and other human impacts have also played a role.",

She was puzzled by idea of a spider vomiting lethal toxins on its prey. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she remembers wondering.",

And sleeping in on the weekend may reduce anxiety, a new study finds \u2014 as long as teens don\u2019t tack on more than two extra hours of shut-eye.",
            "It might seem like a good idea to get as much sleep as possible on the weekend. Sleep is essential for a fully functioning brain and body \u2014 especially for adolescents. And 75 percent of American teens don\u2019t get the recommended eight to 10 hours per night. School, homework and other weekday activities require them to rise early. Teens\u2019 circadian rhythm also makes it difficult to fall asleep before 11 p.m.",
            "Yet past research has hinted that too much sleep on the weekend can lead to health issues. Those studies had found a possible connection between catch-up sleep and depression. But the link hadn\u2019t been carefully studied. What\u2019s more, no one had looked at another major aspect of mental health \u2014 anxiety \u2014 in relation to sleep.",

            "The data included sleep and activity patterns for nearly 1,900 young people. These data came from a Fitbit each participant wore during the study. Participants had also filled out questionnaires about their feelings of anxiety and depression. Kim studied those, too.",
            "Teens who slept in on weekends reported the lowest symptoms of anxiety, but only if they got less than two hours of extra shut-eye. Teens who didn\u2019t sleep in \u2014 or lost sleep on the weekend \u2014 reported higher anxiety levels. Those who slept more than two additional hours had the highest anxiety symptoms of all.",

            "One limit of the new research is that it was an observational study, Depner says. An observational study is one where researchers simply observe something happening in the world. They don\u2019t set up an experiment and control variables to test a hypothesis about how it works.",
            "\u201cThe scientists just watched how people sleep without asking them to try any new sleep habits or treatments,\u201d Depner points out. Having people follow different sleep schedules and then measuring their mental health could help clarify how one affects the other.",

            "If there is a link between just the right amount of catch-up sleep and anxiety \u2014 why? What would make someone who gets more than two hours of extra sleep more anxious?",
            "Kim suspects that having big swings between weekday and weekend sleep schedules creates what scientists call social jet lag.",
            "Like jet lag triggered by traveling between time zones, social jet lag causes grogginess and a foggy brain. It happens when our body\u2019s clock is out of sync with our sleep cycle. Switching from too little sleep to too much is a known trigger. Although Kim\u2019s study didn\u2019t investigate this as a cause, she suspects it\u2019s part of the problem.",
            "Kim didn\u2019t find a clear link between catch-up sleep and symptoms of depression. That might be due to the age group Kim studied. \u201cUsually, depressive symptoms onset later in adolescence,\u201d she says. Anxiety, on the other hand, tends to start when teens are younger. Kim\u2019s next step is to study weekend catch-up sleep among older teens.",
            "For now, she wants teens to know there can be benefits to catch-up sleep. \u201cGetting a little extra sleep on weekends might help [you] feel less anxious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not too much, because it can give you the opposite effect.\u201d"

The leading cause of death worldwide, CVD includes all diseases of the heart and blood vessels. Among them: clogged arteries (a source of heart attacks), stroke, heart failure and more.",
            "To start, the NYU team gathered estimates on DEHP exposures across the globe. These data came from 216 studies published between 2000 and 2023. The studies measured, in people\u2019s bodies, amounts of chemicals made when DEHP breaks down. Called metabolites, such chemicals indicate how much DEHP people were exposed to.",
            "Next, the team looked at how CVD deaths and DEHP exposures had changed over the years. They compared DEHP data from 2008 with death rates from CVD 10 years later among people 55 to 64 years old. From this, they calculated what share of those deaths globally seemed to trace to this phthalate.",
            "More than 2.6 million CVD deaths were recorded for this age group in 2018. The new study links 13.5 percent of them to this plasticizer.",

However, if the link is shown to be causal, that would be quite troubling: It would come to more than one in every eight CVD deaths worldwide.",

The group\u2019s analysis also didn\u2019t account for other factors that might play a role in heart disease, such as diet, exercise or other medical conditions. \u201cMore research is needed,\u201d she says, to also account for these.",

            "Changcheng Zhou is a biomedical scientist at the University of California, Riverside, who studies what causes cardiovascular disease. And he finds the death rate being linked to DEHP \u201cquite alarming.\u201d",
            "That rate varied greatly across the globe. About three in every four of those deaths linked to DEHP occurred in the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific. That might be due to the large and growing plastics industries in those parts of the world, the NYU team suggests.",
            "Future studies could refine these estimates further, the scientists say. Some national health surveys collect data on phthalate exposures. This is true in the United States, Canada and many nations in Europe. Elsewhere, such as in Latin America, Africa and Asia, such national monitoring is lacking, Hyman says. So her team\u2019s estimates of DEHP exposure in those places are based on far fewer people. As such, she notes, links to DEHP in these places might be slightly less precise.",
            "Different phthalates may affect different processes in the body. And they might not operate alone. \u201cYou do need to study the effect of the mixture\u201d of phthalates people encounter regularly, says Mahua Choudhury. She studies environmental risks to our genes at Texas A&M University in College Station. Some phthalates, she notes, could lessen \u2014 or worsen \u2014 the health effects of others.",

            "Phthalates can enter the body when you eat food that had been sold, stored or heated in plastic. We also breathe them in from the air and absorb them through the skin. Once inside the body, they can tinker with hormone action. Previous research has also linked phthalates to diabetes, obesity, pregnancy complications \u2014 and yes, heart disease.",
            "Also quite troubling: One 2020 study linked pregnant moms\u2019 DEHP exposure with mental risks in their children \u2014 such as a lower IQ. Another study linked school-age kids\u2019 exposures to DEHP with a lower IQ \u2014 especially in boys. A more limited IQ risk emerged for dibutyl phthalate (DBP). It\u2019s another plasticizer and solvent. It\u2019s used widely in making PVC plastic, inks, adhesives and cosmetics.",
            "Prenatal exposure to DEHP and DBP also has been linked with lowering a boy\u2019s preference for certain types of play, such as playing with toy guns. It also made boys more likely to engage in gender-neutral types of play \u2014 think puzzles or sports. No such change was seen in girls.",
            "The new NYU study\u2019s findings offer yet another reason to reduce our use of plastics, researchers say. \u201cWe\u2019re going to become the plastic planet,\u201d Zhou worries. \u201cWe need to start to really address this serious issue.\u201d",

Because of the dry conditions, few trees can grow in this ecosystem. With few trees to block gusts, wind sweeps almost constantly across these flatlands. Trees occur along rivers and streams that may cut through the plains.",
            "The Eurasian steppe is the largest in the world. It lies just south of Siberia. It extends over 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) across Europe and Asia. These vast plains provide good pasture for livestock. The region is home to herd animals such as saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) and Przewalski\u2019s horses (Equus przewalskii). Predators \u2014 such as the corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) \u2014 also hunt here, feeding on birds and other small prey.",
            "Another example of a steppe lies in North America \u2014 the Great Plains. This steppe lies east of the Rocky Mountains. As air from the west moves up and over the mountains, water vapor condenses and falls as rain. This leaves the air on the eastern side \u2014 the \u201crain shadow\u201d side \u2014 very dry. This dry air descends to the plains below and cannot support forests. But it does support grasses, which form the steppe.",
            "Grazing herd animals make their home here. The American bison (Bison bison) is one example. Pronghorns (Antilocapra americana) are another. Pronghorns are the fastest land animals in North America. They sprint up to 96 kilometers (60 miles) per hour. That\u2019s fast enough to keep pace with many cars.",
            "Sometimes, humans turn steppes into farmland. Crops that tolerate the dry climate \u2014 such as wheat, barley, and oats \u2014 thrive for a while. However, once the natural grasses get plowed under, the region can become even drier. Soil nutrients can dwindle without natural vegetation to anchor them in place. This can reduce crop production over time.",

            "After earning my bachelor\u2019s degree, I worked at various companies doing research for about 25 years. That\u2019s where I realized that I didn\u2019t have to just study the chemistry of things here on Earth. I could study the chemistry of the universe.\u00a0\u00a0",

In 2016, I got into a doctoral program for physics and astronomy in Australia. In high school and my first years in college, I really struggled with physics.

That suggested that these molecules do exist and could be available for life to develop elsewhere.",

The techniques used to study the chemistry of space are very similar to those used to study whether technology exists beyond Earth.

            "For hundreds of years, we\u2019ve been able to see cells through microscopes. As these spyglasses have gotten more powerful, they\u2019ve been able to zoom in on smaller and smaller details. Yet even when you can see individual microbes, most look pretty similar.",

So to \u201cincrease our understanding and build a database,\u201d Harel says, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to do a lot of experiments on different viruses in different environments.\u201d",
            "Another issue: Many microbes belong to species with lots of related members \u2014 strains that you might think of like siblings. Consider E. coli. These bacteria live almost everywhere. Although most are harmless to people, a few strains can cause serious disease. Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",
            "To find out, scientists will have to just keep listening. Once they have a robust library of sounds, they may be able to tell most microbes apart. That because microbial sounds are very specific, Harel says. It\u2019s like listening for a friend\u2019s voice in a loud place. Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",

            "Peeling tape can create a separation of positive and negative charges that triggers lightning \u2014 micro-lightning. These sparks of energy, illustrated here, may one day be put to useful work.",
            "Rip off a piece of tape in a dark room and you may see a flash of light. This happens because the peeling tape releases energy that creates tiny sparks. It might seem like just a neat little trick. But scientists have now shown this \u201cmicro-lightning\u201d is shockingly powerful. In fact, it can be strong enough to drive chemical reactions in the air.",
            "One day, such micro-sparks could help make some chemicals in a more sustainable way.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve been very interested in the idea of micro-lightning,\u201d says Richard Zare. A chemist, he works at Stanford University in California. His team recently showed sprays of water release tiny sparks that can drive chemical reactions. Now, working with Xinxing Zhang, a physical chemist in China, his team is studying micro-lightning sparked by peeling tape.",
            "fCWatch the glow from electrons jumping as tape is peeled off a roll in the dark.",
            "Using tape was Zhang\u2019s idea. Ripping tape loose from its roll releases visible light. But Zhang knew it also, surprisingly, generates X-rays. He wondered how high this electric charge was and if it sparked chemical reactions. To find out, his team at Nankai University in Tianjin set up an experiment.\u00a0",
            "They started with a roll of sticky tape placed on a bearing. With a motor, they pulled off the tape and wound it around a cylinder. Along the way, the team measured the strength of the electric field that the peeling tape created. They also looked for any changes in the chemistry of the surrounding air.",
            "The test setup pulls tape off a roll and onto a cylinder. A motor controls its speed. The unrolling tape sits on a device (XY translational stage) that can move back and forth. This positions the peeling point in front of a mass spectrometer (Extended MS inlet), which identifies chemicals formed as the zapping triggers air chemicals to react.",

            "fCXufeng Gao",
            "Peeling the tape slowly, at 12.5 centimeters (5 inches) per second, created a small electric field. But when the motor sped up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) per second, the space where the tape left the roll became very highly charged. Zhang\u2019s group tallied a billion volts per meter across this tiny space!",
            "That\u2019s an astonishing voltage \u2014 far beyond what\u2019s usually achieved in the lab, Zare points out. (For perspective, lightning shoots from a storm cloud when the voltage is 3 million volts per meter. In the tape experiment, the high voltage is across too small of a space for the micro-lightning to hurt us.)",
            "The peeling tape\u2019s zap illustrates the triboelectric effect. This is the generation of an electric charge as materials come into contact and then separate. It\u2019s like static electricity, when two objects are rubbed together then moved apart. One object becomes positively charged, meaning it loses electrons. The other gains those lost electrons and becomes negatively charged. (This can make a negatively charged balloon repel electrons from a wall, then \u201cstick\u201d to the positively charged surface. Or, it can send out a tiny zap of electricity.)",
            "The triboelectric effect is at work all around us \u2014 in things as simple as a sliding raindrop and the rustle of our clothes. But the tape experiment created a much higher voltage than most other everyday triboelectric events. Why? Being sticky, the tape peeled off the roll in a jerky way. Scientists call this a \u201cstick\u2013slip\u201d event. It leads to higher charges than when things just rub together or touch.",
            "A high electric field emerged only when the tape was pulled quickly, Zare says. If that electric field is high enough, electrons from the tape will speed up and smash into air molecules or other molecules in the tape. This \u201cleads to a spark that drives chemical reactions,\u201d says Zare. Those electrons flowing between the tape\u2019s surfaces can create a high enough voltage around the tape to break down molecules in the air, he says \u2014 turning them into ions.",
            "Zare\u2019s team repeated what Zhang\u2019s team had done. This time, they also looked to see if molecules of water vapor in the air near the tape would break up and form into new molecules. They did.",
            "Next, Zare\u2019s group put chemicals they suspected would react as vapors in the electric field next to the peeling tape. This was to test a common reaction used in industrial chemistry. (It\u2019s one where pyridine and methyl iodide are reacted to form something new.) Right away, Zare\u2019s group detected new products as these chemicals now reacted.",
            "The team shared its new findings June 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

            "Adhesive bandages can spark a glow in air as they\u2019re peeled off a substance \u2014 such as their wrapper or our skin. Now watch it happen and learn about the physics processes that explain what\u2019s happening to electrons in and around the bandage.",
            "\u201cThis is a fabulous discovery,\u201d says Thalappil Pradeep. A chemist, he studies triboelectricity at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai. There is a lot to discover about what\u2019s happening at the tiny space where the peeling tape first makes contact with the air, he says.",
            "Daniel Lacks agrees. This chemical engineer works at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually look at what\u2019s happening in that little, teeny distance\u201d between two nearly touching surfaces, he says. His own work has focused on particles that pick up an electric charge after rubbing against each other.\u00a0",
            "Lacks finds it \u201cvery cool\u201d that the electric fields created by tape get so high they can drive chemical reactions.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Simone Ciampi works with triboelectric effects at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. What surprised him was the beauty and simplicity of the new experiment.",
            "Guiding chemical reactions with triboelectricity is one type of green chemistry, Ciampi notes. Here, electricity can do work typically done by chemicals that may be toxic. So this approach, he concludes, can be more environmentally friendly.",
            "Chemicals often react through a series of steps. Some may require separating positive and negative charges within a molecule. By controlling those electric charges, you can manage the reaction\u2019s steps to help choose what product you end up with, Ciampi explains.",
            "Indeed, a huge number of chemical reactions are sensitive to electric fields. But there\u2019s often a challenge in using an electric field to guide reactions. The problem, Ciampi says, is the electrically conducting materials used to make the field. Those materials can interfere with the reacting chemicals, which could prevent the desired results.",
            "That\u2019s why Ciampi is excited about this new research. It shows how a material that\u2019s not electrically conductive, such as tape, can create an electric field \u2014 and drive reactions without interfering with them. This, he says, could open \u201can entirely new space in chemistry.\u201d",

            "With their humanlike digestive tracts, vampires would probably starve in real life. That\u2019s because our bodies evolved to rely on a wide array of foods that includes vegetables, meat and grains. ",
            "Vampires have been stalking the human imagination for centuries. These fictional creatures take many forms, including the famous Count Dracula and Morbius of the Marvel Universe. But most share one feature: long, razor-sharp teeth. These fangs help vampires bite the necks of victims to feast on their blood.",
            "Many real bloodthirsty creatures exist in nature. Vampire bats are perhaps the most famous. Mosquitoes and ticks also make the list, as do some spiders and moths. But it would be hard to turn a human body \u2014 even an undead one \u2014 into a blood-drinking monster.\u00a0",
            "\u201cWe can\u2019t survive the way vampires do,\u201d says David Begun. This paleoanthropologist studies how apes, including humans, evolved. He works at the University of Toronto in Canada. In real life, no primates survive on blood, Begun notes. To do so, vampires would need to rework both the mouths and guts that humans inherited from our plant-eating ancestors.",
            "In popular media, vampires puncture skin using knifelike upper canine teeth. Humans occasionally use their canines to tear food, too. But any vampire would probably struggle to reliably break skin. \u201cOur canines are completely unsuited to piercing anything,\u201d says Begun. \u201cThey look more like incisors, our front teeth.\u201d",
            "Human canines have slowly shrunk over time. Like many primates today \u2014 including our close cousins, chimpanzees and gorillas \u2014 our ancestors once sported large, pointed canines. These impressive teeth would have even sharpened themselves by rubbing against neighboring molars.",
            "But anthropologists suspect that these flashy teeth weren\u2019t primarily for eating. Instead, ancient apes probably used them to intimidate rivals and defend themselves. Over time, these teeth grew smaller as our ancestors evolved to live in cooperative groups. Less fighting between males left little need for such large canines.",
            "Vampires would have to revert to big canines, says Begun. Those teeth would also need to be much sharper, more like the teeth of the only real blood-drinking mammals: vampire bats.\u00a0",
            "These blood sippers use their two front incisors to create tiny incisions in their prey. Unlike human teeth, these incisors don\u2019t have enamel. This allows them to remain permanently sharp and to not wear down over time. \u201cNo primate has such sharp canines that would allow that kind of thing to happen,\u201d says Begun.\u00a0",
            "*A_close-up_image_shows_a_common_vampire_bat_face_The_bat_sports_brown_fur,_pointed_ears_and_small_bl",
            "fCUnlike their fictional counterparts, vampire bats (such as the one seen here) don\u2019t suck blood. Instead, these nocturnal predators use their upper incisors to pierce skin. Saliva containing anticoagulants then enters the wound, which prevents blood from clotting. The small bats then use their tongues to lap up the oozing blood. ",
            "Even movies that show vampires growing sharp canines at will would be unrealistic. If taken care of, our permanent teeth don\u2019t change much over the course of our lives. Instead, the size, number and shape of our teeth are all preset by our genes.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cThere are rodents that have continuously growing incisors,\u201d says Begun. Beavers, squirrels and rats are a few examples. \u201cBut they can\u2019t do it at will.\u201d In fact, these rodents must grind their teeth or gnaw on hard items such as wood and bone to keep them short. If left unchecked, overgrown incisors can interfere with eating, injure their mouths and even grow through their skulls.",
            "Finding ways to draw blood from victims isn\u2019t the only hurdle real-life vampires would face. They\u2019d also need to be able to digest it \u2014 and use that food as fuel for their undead activities.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Blood isn\u2019t particularly nutritious. Low in calories, it\u2019s mostly made up of water and protein. Because of their humanlike guts, any vampire would probably suffer from malnutrition or even poisoning.\u202f",
            "\u201cHumans can\u2019t survive on blood alone,\u201d says Begun. \u201cWe need a lot more diversity of nutrients, of vitamins and minerals, that aren\u2019t present in blood.\u201d\u00a0",
            "That\u2019s because we inherited our digestive systems from a long line of omnivores, or animals that eat both plants and other animals. Like today\u2019s chimpanzees, our ape ancestors would\u2019ve likely eaten mostly plants with an occasional helping of meat, says Begun. Long, coiled intestines probably helped them break down tough plants. And bacteria in their guts likely helped further digest this food and absorb nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "By about 2.5 million years ago, our ancestors started eating more meat. Later, humans started cooking with fire. That made digesting foods such as meat and tough plants much easier. Even more recently, people began growing starches such as grains to eat.\u00a0",
            "This led to tweaks in our digestive tracts. We started producing extra enzymes that could break down starches. Meat and other easy-to-digest foods could be broken down in shorter intestines. This resulted in bodies best suited to eating many different foods, says Begun.\u00a0",
            "Even vegans who don\u2019t eat any animal products must have a varied diet. \u201cThey can\u2019t just eat lettuce all day long,\u201d Begun says. \u201cThey have to have beans. They have to have rice. They have to have complete proteins.\u201d ",
            "While low in most nutrients, blood does contain lots of iron.\u00a0Red blood cells hold about 70 percent of the iron in our bodies, where it helps carry oxygen to organs. But consuming too much iron can be toxic to humans, who have no way to digest or excrete large amounts of it. This iron overload can damage body organs, the nervous system and even cause death.",
            "Unlike humans, vampire bats have evolved ways to digest blood. Research suggests that vampire bats lost a gene that blocks intestinal cells from absorbing too much iron. Those gut cells are also short-lived and regularly shed. This lets the bats quickly absorb lots of iron and discard it through their waste. Meanwhile, their gut bacteria help break down proteins. These microbes may also produce extra vitamins not found in blood.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Scientists are still trying to understand why vampire bats started feeding on blood. Some suspect the habit arose from bats that fed on parasites such as ticks. Perhaps the bats eventually started feeding on the blood oozing from wounds left behind when they scarfed down these pests.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Whatever led bats to their taste for blood, it\u2019s clear humans weren\u2019t shaped by those same evolutionary pressures. And changing how a real species eats usually requires tens of thousands, if not millions, of years of evolution. That\u2019s a lot more involved than the single bite needed to make a fictional vampire.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Still, this reality shouldn\u2019t stop movie-goers from enjoying vampires, Begun says. \u201cIt\u2019s still OK to enjoy a vampire movie or a vampire TV show, even if it\u2019s not actually feasible.\u201d"

            "Have you ever wondered why leaves change from green to an amazing array of yellow, orange and red hues during the fall?",
            "Leaves get their brilliant colors from pigments made up of various color-creating molecules. During the warm, sunny months, plants use their leaves to turn sunlight into food energy, a process called photosynthesis. This primarily uses a pigment that reflects green light, which gives the leaves their characteristic color. In autumn, when colder, shorter days arrive, many kinds of trees no longer make food energy with their leaves and, consequently, no longer need the green pigment. The leaves\u2019 other pigments \u2014 some of which were already there during summer \u2014 become visible.",
            "In this science activity, you will uncover these hidden colors by separating plant pigments with a process called paper chromatography. What colors will you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/YxOSHj_kVlA?feature=oembed",
            "In this science activity, let\u2019s use paper chromatography to uncover the hidden pigments lurking in tree leaves.",
            "Because some plant pigments can stain, be careful not to spill your colored solutions when throwing them away.",
            "Even though a plant leaf looks like it is mostly one color, it is actually made up of a mixture of pigment molecules. In this activity, a scientific technique called\u00a0paper chromatography\u00a0was used to separate the individual color pigments. You should see different colors at different locations as you go along one of the paper towel strips, and the order in which the colors appear should be roughly the same among the different color solutions you tested.",
            "What are the different bands of color on the test strips? These are the different pigments in the leaves. The ones you may see on your paper towel strips are: green chlorophyll, yellow xanthophylls, orange carotenoids and red anthocyanins. Pigments travel along the paper strip based on their interactions with the paper strip and the isopropyl alcohol solution. Pigments that are more attracted to the paper strip than the isopropyl alcohol stay near the bottom of the strip, where the solution was first \u201cpainted\u201d onto the pencil line. Pigments that are more attracted to the alcohol than the paper strip usually travel farther up the strip. Because the color of the leaf depends on the mixture of pigments in it, different colored leaves will display different colors on their paper towel strips. For example, very green leaves may not have any red colors (anthocyanins) on their strips.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/TtAENPSThI4?feature=oembed",
            "Want to know more about paper chromatography? Science Buddies explains.",
            "There are many types of pigments in plant leaves. Chlorophyll makes them look green and helps carry out photosynthesis during warm, sunny months. As fall arrives and the green, food-making color fades, other pigments such as yellow, orange and red ones become more visible.",
            "Xanthophylls are yellow pigments, and carotenoids give leaves an orange color. Photosynthesis also uses these pigments during the summer, but chlorophyll, a stronger pigment, overpowers them. These pigments take more time to break down than chlorophyll does, so you see them become visible in fall leaves. They are also found in carrots, daffodils, bananas and other plants that have these vibrant colors.",
            "There are also anthocyanins, intense red pigments that are not made during the summer, only appearing with the final group of the fall colors. These molecules also give the red hue to apples, cranberries, strawberries and more.",
            "Although a leaf is a mixture of these pigments, you can separate the colors using a method called\u00a0paper chromatography. In this method, a mixture (such as your pigment mixture) is applied onto a chromatography paper. The paper strip is dipped into a liquid, called the solvent or mobile phase. The liquid will start traveling up the paper strip and carry all the components within the mixture (such as your different color pigments) along through the chromatography paper. While traveling up the paper, each component interacts with the paper and the solvent differently depending on its chemical properties. Some of them are more attracted to the paper, whereas others prefer to stay in the mobile phase. As a result, each individual component travels along the paper at a different speed. This is how with paper chromatography a colorful mixture of pigment molecules can be separated into each individual pigment component.",
            "You can learn more about paper chromatography in the video above. The video gives an overview of what paper chromatography is, shows how it is done, explains the separation processes involved and also provides tips and tricks for troubleshooting your experiment.",

            "Some people see a pickleball and want to smash it. When Anchal Sareen saw some pickleballs lying around a lab a few years ago, she thought about submarines and airplanes. As a mechanical engineer who studies how fluids affect movement, she couldn\u2019t help it. So she went right out, bought a balloon and wrapped it around the pickleball. It became the inspiration for a new surface to speed and steer aircrafts and underwater drones.",

            "In a pair of recent papers, Sareen and her team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor have now shown how dimple depth can alter drag. Drag is the friction-like force that slows things down as they travel through a fluid. They\u2019ve also shown how changing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dimples can help steer an object through air, water or other fluids.",

            "Douglas studies fluid flow as a way to improve the systems that propel vehicles. Engineers, he notes, have long been altering surface roughness to reduce drag.",
            "But drag isn\u2019t always a bad thing, he adds.",
            "Fins and rudders guide a ship by increasing drag in one place more than in another. This nudges a ship in a desired direction. And dimples might help here, too, says Sareen. She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",
            "They tested these plastic models in wind tunnels to identify how dimple depth affected drag.",
            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/De2VQYkdztM?feature=oembed",
            "Anchal Sareen and her team explain how they used soft robotic technology to develop dynamic surface dimples \u2014 ones that can change at different flow speeds \u2014 to cut the drag experienced by underwater vehicles. It should also allow them to maneuver without fins and rudders.",
            "They\u2019re also developing tests to see if the design would work in real-world conditions, such as the skin of some vessel sailing through air or water.",
            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",
            "\u201dA lot of people have asked me, \u2018Are you planning to patent this as a golf ball which can stay in the air?'\u201d Sareen laughs and says: Not any time soon."

            "Nearly 100 million years ago, a drop of tree resin captured a gruesome scene: a fungus bursting from the body of a young ant. That resin eventually hardened into amber. Today, this fossil is offering insight into a fungus that\u2019s become famous for hijacking its victims\u2019 brains. The ancient insect\u2019s demise suggests such fungi have been\u202finfecting ants twice as long as scientists had thought.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "That fungus is called Ophiocordyceps (OH-fee-oh-KOR-dih-seps). It infects \u2014 and \u201czombifies\u201d \u2014 insects such as flies, caterpillars and ants.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Right before an infected ant dies, it will have a sudden urge to leave its nest and climb up onto a high leaf. There, it will bite down with a death grip. In one final gory moment, the fungus will then explode from the ant\u2019s back.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "That blast releases spores that can now infect the fungus\u2019 next victims.\u00a0",
            "How these fungi infect insects and control their behavior is fairly well known. But little had been known about when this bone-chilling behavior first began. Why? The soft bodies of fungi hardly ever become fossils. Even rarer, the researchers note, is finding a fossil insect with the fungus still inside.\u00a0",
            "It was a stroke of luck when Yuhui Zhuang stumbled across the ant fossil. The paleontologist had been digging through samples in his lab\u2019s basement at Yunnan University in Kunming, China.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When he saw something sticking out of one ant\u2019s back, Zhuang first assumed it was a developing wing. Both ant queens and males have wings. But a 3-D image of the fossil revealed something different.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "That fungus was remarkably similar to modern-day Ophiocordyceps \u2014 the \u201czombie fungus.\u201d Its spores had a similar shape. Plus, the spores were growing out of a domelike structure that had burst from the insect\u2019s back.\u00a0",
            "Intrigued, Zhuang went hunting for other infected insect fossils. That search turned up a fungus-ridden fly in a different collection of specimens. This insect, too, had been trapped in amber. And the fungus in it looked a lot like modern-day\u202fOphiocordyceps.\u00a0",

            "The ant and fly fossils were both 99 million years old. It seems that ancestors of\u202ftoday\u2019s \u201czombie fungi\u201d were already infecting multiple groups of insects back then, says Conrad Labandeira. This paleontologist did not take part in the new study. He works at the National Museum of Natural History. It\u2019s in Washington, D.C.\u00a0",
            "The ant and fly fossils suggest Ophiocordyceps evolved alongside its victims, says Zhuang.\u202fThe oldest fossil ant ever found is 113 million years old. So fungi might have been infecting the ancestors of ants almost since they first appeared.\u00a0",
            "The ant in the newfound fossil was a pupa. During this stage of an ant\u2019s life, it can\u2019t move, Zhuang notes. So the fungus was likely not controlling this ant\u2019s behavior.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Perhaps a grown ant noticed the pupa was infected and removed it from the nest,\u202fhe says. Outside, the fungus would now have released its spores in search of its next victim.\u00a0",

            "The most common of these ingredients were alpha-hydroxy acids. These chemicals exfoliate skin, removing surface layers. They\u2019re common in anti-aging products because they can smooth fine lines and wrinkles and improve skin texture. They\u2019re also used in some products to prevent acne. But they can irritate and damage young skin.",
            "Creators used products with alpha-hydroxy acids an average of three times per video and as many as seven times in one regimen. This is harmful because the chemical becomes more irritating the more you layer it.",
            "Alpha-hydroxy acids also increase the skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends staying out of the sun and using sunscreen with these products. But on average, only 26 percent of the TikTok videos included any type of sun protection. So these regimens would boost the risk of sunburn and other sun damage.",
            "Though not part of the study, pediatrician Molly O\u2019Shea was distressed by the findings. \u201cThe majority of the products that were being shown and demonstrated weren\u2019t designed for young skin,\u201d says O\u2019Shea. She practices in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.",

            "The majority of content creators they viewed had light skin. But since TikTok\u2019s feed is driven by an algorithm, the researchers don\u2019t know how well what they saw reflects the whole platform.

            "From Spotify playlists to street performers to film scores, music is everywhere. Fast, loud songs can pump you up for a workout. Slow, sad tunes are perfect for wallowing in bad moods. For many of us, making and consuming music is an important part of life. Which raises the question: What is music, exactly?",
            "There is no simple answer. People across time and cultures have defined music differently. But at least in Western cultures, music generally shares some common features. The basic building blocks of songs are notes. These pitches can be high or low, depending on the frequency of the sound waves that create them. The note middle C, for instance, is created by sound waves with a frequency of about 260 hertz. That means the sound waves vibrate about 260 times per second. Waves with higher frequencies create higher pitches.",
            "String some notes together, and you get a melody. Play two or more notes at the same time, and you\u2019ve got harmony. The timing of those notes makes up a song\u2019s rhythm. The speed of that rhythm is called tempo.",
            "Of course, different instruments can play all those elements of a song the same way and still sound different. That\u2019s because instruments of different shapes, sizes and materials have different timbres (TAM-bers). Timbre describes the quality of an instrument\u2019s sound. It allows you to tell whether a piano, violin or trumpet is playing the same note. Some have claimed that instruments built with certain kinds of wood or made by certain artists sound better than others. But recent research has cast doubt on those ideas.",
            "Our ears collect the sound waves made by instruments. Those signals are then sent to the brain for processing. Some people discern pitches better than others. (Those with the brain disorder amusia, though, cannot tell pitches apart at all.) Individuals who speak tonal languages, such as the Chinese language Mandarin, may be especially good at this. In these languages, pitches help give words their meanings. So, speaking this type of language may help people discern musical pitches, too.

            "Others had mapped groundwater flows in various parts of the United States. But how distant sources of underground water might be connected hadn\u2019t been clear. That was one motivation for this study, says Maxwell. Understanding how water moves across a continent underground can help show how, when and where impacts to that water may occur.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Maxwell and Condon\u2019s team decided to track groundwater\u2019s flow beneath most of continental North America. They started with where this water reemerges in streams. Then, working backward, they figured out where it must have first seeped into the Earth.",
            "To do this, they built a computer model. It simulated North America\u2019s underground layers of rock to depths of 392 meters (1,200 feet). Next, they divided the continent into little blocks. Each was one kilometer long by one kilometer wide.",
            "Then they asked the model to calculate how much water would likely flow through each block. That would depend on the shape and thickness of Earth\u2019s underground layers and the space between the rocks.",
            "Each block is like a Lego brick, Maxwell says. Once they calculated water\u2019s flow in each one, they stacked them together \u2014 85 million of them.",
            "Then they added simulated water droplets to the computer model. The model \u201cpushes\u201d these droplets around based on how water would flow through the layers of below ground rock. And the scientists tracked everywhere they would go.",
            "\u201cThink of a video game: Where would the little ball go? It\u2019ll be pushed by the velocity this way,\u201d says Condon. \u00a0Then, \u201cwhere would it go next?\u201d",
            "Water often travels more than 97 kilometers (60 miles), the model showed. That wouldn\u2019t be far if water was streaming across the surface, says Maxwell. But it was far longer than it had been expected to flow below ground.",
            "Most water stays below the surface for five to 10 years, the model found. But buried aquifers (underground layers of water-filled rock) also exist. Water can collect in them for 100,000 to 1 million years.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/zyHtkDCwQUw?feature=oembed",
            "Rain and snow seep into the Earth, forming streams of groundwater that travel long distances below the surface.",
            "Knowing how far water travels and for how long helps determine impacts to water. How? \u201cIf you have pollution underground, you need to understand where it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Maxwell explains.",
            "Consider, for instance, the nitrate fertilizers that farmers apply to soils. In large amounts, nitrates can harm people and aquatic life. Rain can wash these chemicals into groundwater. From there, they can potentially travel far from the farms on which they had been used. That can pollute water once thought to be free of such chemicals.",
            "Models might also point to where water being pumped from the ground at one site (for drinking or irrigation) had been on its way to hydrate a distant wetland. Knowing this, says Claudia Faunt, managers might then make sure they leave enough water in the ground to sustain that wetland \u2014 and the ecosystem it supports. Faunt didn\u2019t take part in the new study. But as a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in San Diego, Calif., she understands these issues.\u00a0",
            "\u201cEverything\u2019s connected,\u201d Maxwell says. By knowing how one watershed may be linked to others, you can understand how the system works as a whole, he explains. And that could be key to managing Earth\u2019s life-giving resource. \u00a0"

            "Many of us have eaten something that left us sick. \u201cNot only is it terrible in the moment, but it leads us to not eat those foods again,\u201d notes Christopher Zimmerman. He\u2019s a neuroscientist at Princeton University in New Jersey.",

            "The new device was inspired by the structure of human ears. The outer ear doesn\u2019t split noise up into pitches. But it does help people determine where different pitches are coming from.",
            "A source at the center of the gadget makes noise from about 8 to 13 kilohertz. Those sound like very high notes. (The highest note on a piano is around 4 kilohertz.) Zeroing in on those frequencies let researchers keep their acoustic rainbow generator small. It\u2019s about the size of a human ear. To handle lower notes, it would have to be bigger. \u00a0",
            "The gizmo works thanks to a smattering of misshapen pillars. Those pillars reflect sound waves in a way that makes them cross paths, or interfere. When waves interfere, they can reinforce or cancel each other out. The result of this complex dance is that sound waves of different pitches get amplified at different places around the device.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/AwlEGQPRfmQ?feature=oembed",
            "An acoustic rainbow spreads the different pitches that make up white noise into different places. You can hear an example in this simulation, in which the device rotates relative to a listener (red dot).",
            "Building a structure that can create an acoustic rainbow is complex. Why? Because juggling sound waves of varying wavelengths is such an intricate process.",
            "To overcome that challenge, Christiansen\u2019s group did something called inverse design.",
            "First, they used a computer model to see what field of sound waves a given design would create. Then, they compared that output with the acoustic rainbow they were going for. They kept tweaking their blueprint until its sound field matched the rainbow.",
            "Once the design was fine-tuned, a 3-D printer produced a prototype. Lab tests showed that it worked as intended.",
            "The pillars inside the device may seem \u201cvery random-looking or weird-looking,\u201d says Christiansen. \u201cBut they really serve their purpose well, because they\u2019ve been tailored for providing exactly what we asked for.\u201d",

            "All sunglasses will darken a view somewhat, but they may not reduce glare. For that, you\u2019ll need polarizing lenses. And to protect the eyes from the sun\u2019s damaging rays, the lenses will have to be treated even more. ",
            "Bright sunlight can flash off water, glass or metal. The resulting glare will make it hard to see anything clearly. The solution: Put on a pair of sunglasses with polarized lenses.",
            "Regular, tinted sunglasses contain a coating that reduces sunlight\u2019s intense brightness. It\u2019s like putting thin curtains on a window. But to cut the glare, their lenses need more than a tint. They need what\u2019s more like window blinds \u2014 something that lets some light through while blocking the glare.",
            "\u201cPolarized lenses reduce eye strain and improve visibility and contrast,\u201d explains physicist Liliane Ventura. She works at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo, in Brazil. There, she studies sunglasses and other vision aids.",
            "Special filters in polarized lenses reduce \u201cthe disruptive effects of glare,\u201d she says. That makes \u201coutdoor activities like driving, fishing and skiing safer.\u201d",
            "But an even bigger problem for our vision can be the sun\u2019s ultraviolet (UV) light. Chronic exposure to these rays can lead to permanent eye damage \u2014 such as cataracts and even cancer.",
            "Sunglasses without UV filters may fail to protect our eyes against this damaging light, Ventura\u2019s team has found. Indeed, Ventura\u2019s team reported earlier this year, \u201cThe majority of sunglass lenses in [its new] study inadequately filtered harmful UV radiation, leaving eyes susceptible to long-term injury.\u201d",
            "Knowing that not all sunglasses are the same, we can look at how these different filters work.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Light travels as a jumble of waves. \u201cThink of sunlight as a bunch of waves vibrating in all possible directions,\u201d Ventura says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we call unpolarized light.\u201d When sunlight hits an especially reflective surface, though \u2014 such as water or the hood of a car \u2014 much of the light will reflect in just one direction. Usually, it\u2019s horizontal.",
            "The randomly focused light is known as polarization. Polarized light vibrates in just one direction.",
            "Most reflections from horizontal surfaces polarize light. We experience this as glare. However, reflections are not the only way to polarize light. Certain filters can polarize light, too. And these polarizers explain the glare-diminishing effects of some sunglasses.",
            "\u201cVery clever guys in the past thought, \u2018Why don\u2019t we intercept the pathway of polarized light [through the lenses of sunglasses]?\u2019\u201d explains Jos\u00e9 Toschi. An optical engineer, he directs research at Suntech Supplies in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. There, he helps design eyewear, including sunglasses.",
            "*an_illustration_showing_how_polarized_lenses_change_block_horizontal_light_waves",
            "fCPolarized lenses allow vertical light waves (here drawn as light green) to pass through while blocking horizontal light waves (here drawn as orange) \u2014 the ones that cause glare.",
            "This approach applies filters to the lenses. These filters contain molecules lined up next to each other. They create a pattern that resembles a picket fence. \u201cTogether, these molecular lines work [to block out glare],\u201d Toschi says.",
            "Here\u2019s how it works. Imagine passing a rope through an opening between two pickets in a fence. Tie one end to a tree. On the other side of the fence, move the free end of the rope up and down. The vertical waves that this creates in the rope can slide through the opening of the fence. Wave the rope from left to right, however, and the waves will become horizontal \u2014 and won\u2019t pass through the fence. The direction of the waves no longer aligns with the openings between the pickets.",
            "This is exactly what happens with polarized sunglasses. The filter\u2019s tiny molecular lines act like the pickets in the fence. When light waves try to pass through the glasses\u2019 lines, only the vertical waves make it through. All horizontal waves \u2014 the glare \u2014 get blocked out.",
            "With that glare now removed, colors appear more vivid and everything looks clearer. The same will not happen with sunglasses that are merely tinted. Their lenses simply reduce how much overall light reaches your eyes.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/1Z6rXEl2agk?feature=oembed",
            "Without polarized sunglasses, we\u2019re unable to see the crocodile hiding in the water; it becomes visible when the water is viewed through polarized sunglasses.",
            "If you\u2019re uncertain whether your tinted sunglasses are polarized, take this simple test.",
            "Look at a screen \u2014 such as the one on a smart phone \u2014 while wearing the glasses. As you tilt your head or the phone, the screen\u2019s color might change or even darken. If it does, congratulations: You\u2019re wearing polarized lenses.",
            "This works because the lens\u2019 filter is \u201cblocking some of the light,\u201d explains Ventura. And how much it blocks will change as you tilt the phone\u2019s screen.",
            "However, Toschi notes, polarizing lenses alone aren\u2019t enough to protect our eyes. The sun\u2019s UV rays can lead to more than short-term discomfort.",
            "For instance, one study in rabbits found that repeated exposure of their eyes\u2019 cornea \u2014 the clear, outermost layer \u2014 to UV rays reduces the amount of antioxidant enzymes. The paper cautions, this \u201cvery probably contributes to the damage of the cornea (and possibly also deeper parts of the eye)\u201d due to highly reactive oxidants.",
            "Protective lenses should also filter out UV light. And that\u2019s not one wavelength but a spectrum of them. They fall into two bands of light known as UV-A and UV-B.",
            "\u201c[Good] lenses should be able to block the whole spectrum,\u201d Toschi says. \u201cSo, when one buys sunglasses, one should demand the UV400 certificate from the vendor.\u201d It confirms that these glasses contain a coating that blocks the entire UV-A and UV-B spectrum \u2014 wavelengths that span from 280 to 400 nanometers.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/ME1v5ST0yeQ?feature=oembed",
            "An eye doctor explains the many risks to our eyes from exposure to the sun\u2019s UV rays in all seasons \u2014 even on cloudy days. Not-so-fun fact: Up to 10 percent of skin cancers occur on eyelids \u2014 yet another reason to wear protective glasses. Learn which types of eyewear protect best.",
            "Sunglasses have been used for centuries. But as new technology emerges, so do new designs.",
            "For instance, not all light passes through sunglasses\u2019 lenses on its way to your eyes. Some can come around the sides, Ventura notes. Some glasses are now being designed to prevent sunlight from entering through frame edges.",
            "\u201cBut the research that excites me the most on polarized lenses is nanocoatings,\u201d Ventura says. \u201cThese use ultra-thin layers that block glare, UV, fog and reflections all at once.\u201d",
            "Some of these new lenses are even being sold as \u201csmart.\u201d They can adjust their polarization, for instance, so you get less glare when you\u2019re outdoors but more light when you\u2019re indoors.",
