Plants slowly sway from side to side, a process called nutation (noo-TAY-shun). Circumnutation is a type of nutation in which plants move in a circle or ellipse. That movement is caused by plant organs growing at different times and at different rates throughout the day.",
            "In circumnutation, the tip of the plant moves in a slow circle. And because the plant is growing, the circle it traces out gets higher and higher. By following this path, some plants, like vines, can take on a coil or helix shape. Different species of plants circumnutate in different directions. A type of cress called Arabidopsis moves clockwise. Beans and soybeans move counterclockwise.",

When planted in large groups, as they are in fields, sunflowers\u2019 broad leaves easily shade their neighbors. So each plant circles throughout the day to maximize the light it gets. Because all the plants are moving, sunny patches constantly shift. This forces the plants to continually move in search of better light.\u00a0",

That\u2019s a big deal because an atom\u2019s nucleus determines which element it is. By making new nuclei, nucleosynthesis makes different elements, too.",

For example, all helium atoms have two protons. Helium\u2019s atomic number is 2. If an atom has two protons, it\u2019s a helium atom. If, by some process, a helium atom gains two more protons, it will no longer be helium. It would now be beryllium.",

As matter and space rapidly expanded from the Big Bang, particles started to group together. Some of those particles were protons and neutrons.

            "Of Pluto\u2019s five moons, Charon is unusually large. It\u2019s half Pluto\u2019s size and has a little less than one-ninth as much mass. Since the 1990s, planetary scientists have thought that Charon could have formed in a way similar to Earth\u2019s moon. Some impact on Pluto might have splashed out hot, molten material, which then began orbiting around it. Eventually that debris could have come together, forming a large moon.",
            "But, just as with Earth\u2019s moon, details of that possible scenario have been fuzzy. \u201cIt goes: Something hit Pluto,\u201d Denton says. Then \u201cquestion mark, question mark, question mark \u2014 Charon is now there.\u201d",
            "Past computer models of such collisions seemed to yield a system like Pluto and Charon. But those models treated the rocky, icy bodies as fluids. They ignored their material strength. And that would have been a decent assumption for large objects, such as gas giants or galaxies. When something hits them, those do behave like fluids. But Pluto and Charon are ice-wrapped rocks. And, it turns out, you can\u2019t ignore that.",
            "The real Charon-forming collision would have been a lot less splashy, Denton says. So in her team\u2019s models, the researchers included Pluto\u2019s and Charon\u2019s rocky cores and icy mantles and crusts. And then it turned out that the protoplanets had an instant connection.",

            "\u201cI immediately thought \u2018Wow, this is something cool,\u2019\u201d recalls Vila. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201d",

            "The researchers brought the larvae and some termites back to their lab. Vila works at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain. The group hoped to understand how the impostors get by, unnoticed, among the termites.",
            "The team examined the larvae under the microscope. They also documented how the two species interacted.",
            "Body shape is important, their work revealed. Scent also plays a role.",
            "Underground in the dark, termites use chemical signals to recognize each other. And each colony has a unique scent. If you put a termite from a different colony into the nest, \u201cthey kill it immediately,\u201d Vila says.",
            "The blowfly larvae, it turns out, emitted the same smell as the termites they were living among.",
            "It\u2019s unclear how blowfly larvae ended up in the termite nest. The researchers think adults laid their eggs around or inside of the nest. Then the termites \u201cadopted\u201d the impostors. But researchers don\u2019t know why.",
            "The larvae tend to stay in the most populated areas of the nest, the team found. So it\u2019s even possible that the termites might be feeding them.\u00a0",
            "The blowflies belong to the Rhyncomya genus. But the exact species remains a mystery. A second expedition unearthed just two more blowfly larvae \u2014 but no adults. That suggests this nest-sharing is very rare. Finding adult blowflies would help ID the nest-sharing interlopers\u2019 species.",
            "Other Rhyncomya species don\u2019t have these disguises, Vila says. \u201cThis tells us that evolution can be very fast under some circumstances.\u201d"

            "Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",

The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities.

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",

However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",

            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",

Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Autism seems to be mostly genetic. Parents pass down to their children genes that have been linked to this type of brain development. Some research suggests environmental factors also may play some role. However, direct links to such non-genetic factors have not yet been proven.

For example, one may have good social skills but struggle with executive function. Another may be non-speaking, but easily manage daily routines.",
            "Depending on their profile, each autistic person may need a different type of support. Some may need help communicating, others help with getting organized. Yet others may need assistance with processing sensory data.",

It\u2019s also why experts no longer like describing autistic people as \u201chigh-\u201d or \u201clow-functioning.\u201d Such terms don\u2019t make sense, says Suhansini Sundaresan.

            "Study after study confirms that vaccines are safe and save lives. So, most parents say yes to vaccines. They want to protect their children from diseases that can cause permanent harm or even death. Yet some parents say no. Many of these people base that refusal on a 1998 study that claimed to find a link between autism and vaccines.",
            "Autism is a disorder that affects how the brain develops. Its symptoms can range from mild to severe. These symptoms can start to appear around the same time that kids get many of their vaccinations.\u00a0So the 1998 study worried parents. Many feared their kids might develop autism after getting the MMR vaccine. That vaccine gets its name from the fact that it protects against three major childhood diseases: measles, mumps and rubella.",
            "In fact, the 1998 study\u2019s claims were false. Scientists debunked the report long ago. Still, some people haven\u2019t learned about that or refuse to believe data that find no signs of an autism link. None. The most recent of these follow-up studies \u2014 and the largest \u2014 came out March 5, 2019 in the\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine. Like the others, it found no link between autism and vaccines.",
            "In this new study, Anders Hviid of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark and his colleagues collected data on more than 657,000 Danish children between 1999 and 2013. They followed the children from age 1. Denmark provides free vaccines for children. As a result, most families chose to have their kids receive the MMR vaccine. But not all.",
            "Over the study period, 6,517 children were diagnosed with autism. But the team found that children who got the MMR vaccine were no more likely to be diagnosed with autism than were those who didn\u2019t get it. Groups that might be more susceptible to autism also did not have an increased risk from being vaccinated.",
            "The initial claim of a possible autism link appeared in The Lancet. A small study, it had focused on just 11 boys and one girl with autism. Led by a surgeon in England, Andrew Wakefield, this study linked autism in these kids to their having gotten the MMR vaccine.",
            "That 1998 study had not been performed well. Later research would show this. That didn\u2019t stop parents around the world from panicking over its claims, however.",
            "Many scientists also were concerned about the claims by Wakefield\u2019s group. Some of them tried to repeat the study. But they didn\u2019t get the same result. Much larger studies investigated further. They, too, failed to find support for the claim made by Wakefield\u2019s team. More than that, research turned up evidence that Wakefield committed fraud. A series of articles published in BMJ, a British medical journal, outlined much of the evidence for that in 2011.",
            "Despite all of this, the 1998 study\u2019s claims have mushroomed online. One 2016 study in the\u00a0Journal of Communication in Healthcare found nearly 500 anti-vaccine websites. The study\u2019s authors looked at tactics used by different websites. Fear of autism is a big theme, thanks to the now-discredited study, it found. Some websites even cast Wakefield as a victim. Those websites dismissed or excused the big problems with his report.",
            "Other websites included vague appeals to readers\u2019 values or emotions. Some sites argued for individual freedom of choice. Those arguments don\u2019t mention that public health and safety laws protect everyone. Other websites fostered distrust of doctors and companies that make vaccines. They did not point out that parents will need both doctors and vaccines if children get sick. Still other sites suggested that vaccines were somehow toxic or not \u201cnatural.\u201d They ignored the fact that preventable diseases are \u201cnatural\u201d \u2014 yet can still be deadly.",

            "Sometimes when scientists can\u2019t replicate, or reproduce, another study\u2019s findings, it\u2019s because someone made a mistake. But Wakefield\u2019s group didn\u2019t just make mistakes, scientists would find. And the 1998 study wasn\u2019t just false. It was \u201cfraudulent,\u201d editors of\u00a0BMJ would later report.",
            "In January 2010, a government panel in the United Kingdom announced that it had found many problems with the 1998 study. Wakefield, for example, had gotten money from lawyers involved in lawsuits against the companies that make vaccines. That\u2019s considered a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d Wakefield also was charged with picking and choosing data to show what he wanted. That reflected poor study design. Evidence also showed that the team had fudged data \u2014 changed them to make them say what Wakefield wanted. Beyond that, there were ethical problems with how Wakefield\u2019s team had gotten data on the children.",
            "Wakefield lost his medical license. And\u00a0The Lancet\u00a0retracted his group\u2019s paper in February 2010. Scientific journals have since become more attentive to signs of potential fraud.",
            "Yet the damage from Wakefield\u2019s work continues. Many parents still refuse to vaccinate their children because of his team\u2019s initial claims.",
            "\u201cI see your pain [and] your desire for answers to your children\u2019s health problems,\u201d said Washington State Secretary of Health John Wiesman. He made this comment as an aside to parents of children with autism during a March 5 congressional hearing in Washington, D.C. But the answer is not to refuse vaccines, Wiesman stressed.",
            "In the end, says Hotez, there is no link between vaccines and autism. That complex brain condition starts during pregnancy \u2014 long before anyone gets vaccines, he notes.",
            "Hotez wrote about many more studies confirming the lack of any vaccine link to autism in a 2018 book. It\u2019s about own adult daughter, Rachel, who has autism. And the title sums up what all the studies show:\u00a0Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel\u2019s Autism."

She switched to a New Hampshire boarding school for children who were smart but struggled in regular schools. One of Grandin\u2019s favorite activities there was riding horses. When a horse grew frightened or upset, she often found ways to calm it.",
            "One summer, Grandin visited her aunt\u2019s ranch in Arizona. There, she saw a cattle chute (sometimes also called a squeeze chute). The narrow pen had sides that could press together. The design holds cattle still while they receive shots or other treatment. After seeing how the pen calmed down cattle, Grandin asked her aunt to close her inside it. She felt safe and calm inside, as though someone was protecting her.",
            "Back at school, Grandin built her own squeeze machine. Her science teacher encouraged her to study whether it could calm other students too. She found many students liked it. Observing their responses and collecting data made Grandin want to become a scientist.",
            "Grandin kept analyzing her squeeze machine in college while earning a degree in psychology. She also studied animal behavior and genetics. Throughout, she remained interested in how animals thought. \u201cI saw a movie in high school that used a distorted room to create optical illusions,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was fascinated. It made me think about how animals perceived things, because animals see in pictures too.\u201d",

She also noticed how simple changes often solved the problem. \u201cI would do something like pick up a hose from the floor, or light up a chute that was dark. Then cattle would walk right through a place where they had refused to go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt amazed me that I could do something so simple and take away their fear.\u201d",
            "After graduate school, Grandin kept working with livestock farmers. She redesigned dip vats \u2014 big pools for bathing farm animals in anti-insect solutions \u2014 so that cattle would walk into them without panicking. And she developed new designs for slaughterhouses. Rather than force cattle on a straight path, her designs led the animals along curving runways. Cattle follow these curved pathways, calmly and orderly, until they could be killed humanely.",
            "In Grandin\u2019s view, the handling of animals at stockyards and slaughterhouses is much more humane now than when she started her work. But today she is worried about a new problem. She calls it \u201cbiological system overload.\u201d In her view, many farmers and ranchers are too focused on breeding animals that will produce lots of meat, milk or eggs. They selectively breed animals with these traits. But they don\u2019t think about other traits, such as strength or resistance to disease. As a result, Grandin sees many animals that lead shorter and less healthy lives.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve bred animals that produce really well, but they have a lot of weaknesses,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople think that if they change an animal\u2019s genetics, they can breed a cow that makes lots of milk, has lots of calves and will have a body that can also fight off disease.

On large farms, Grandin has seen laying hens \u2014 those kept as egg producers \u2014 that have osteoporosis (OS-tee-oh-puh-ROH-sis). This disease causes the bones to become weak and brittle. Eventually, the bones can break. \u201cThese hens are pushed so hard to produce eggs that all the hard stuff is being removed from their bodies,\u201d Grandin says.",

            "When animals produce less milk or meat, farmers might worry about making less money. But Grandin points out that breeding healthier animals actually can benefit farmers. \u201cIt takes energy for animals to maintain their immune systems,\u201d Grandin explains. \u201cIf animals don\u2019t have strong immune systems, they get sick and die more easily.\u201d And when livestock die, farmers definitely lose money.",

This bird flu swept through chicken and turkey farms in 15 states across the U.S. Midwest during the spring and summer of 2015. Even when just a few birds get sick, farmers have to slaughter the whole flock. That serves to limit the spread of the virus. The 2015 outbreak proved costly.

            "Like dogs, African giant pouched rats have a great sense of smell. Researchers thought the rodents might be able to detect illegal goods that are smuggled across country lines. So trainers taught them to identify items from at-risk species. The animals might be able to help protect those species by finding smuggled ones before they could be sold.",
            "Many tourists visit regions like West Africa to see wildlife. But some species are disappearing. Poachers add to this problem by catching animals for the pet trade. Or they may illegally kill some for their parts. They might hack horns off living rhinos, for instance. Or they might leave dead elephants to rot on a forest floor. Products like rhino horns or elephant tusks are usually taken to other countries to be sold.",

For example, some of these rats learned to detect dangerous weapons. Some can even sniff out a lung disease called tuberculosis.",

They also signaled when they sniffed rhino horn, elephant tusk and African blackwood (used in some musical instruments). Eventually, rats who completed these tests could tell the four scents apart from 146 other odors. Szott was part of a team that reported their results October 29 in Frontiers in Conservation Science.",

Sundogs can appear alone, as a pair on either side of the sun or on a halo that circles the sun. They can also occur at night when the moon is bright. These are known as moon dogs.",
            "Sundogs often contain a colorful, rainbowlike streak. That\u2019s because the sun\u2019s white light is made up of many different wavelengths, or colors of light. And those light waves bend at slightly different angles off ice crystals in the air. This separates incoming sunlight into the colors of the rainbow. But unlike a rainbow, which always has red on the outer edge, red appears on the inside of the sundog, closest to the sun. Blue appears on the outer edge of a sundog, farthest from the sun.",

            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",

He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",

            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often.",

A couple of smaller quakes followed shortly thereafter, in 1960. There likely also would have been smaller undetected temblors, Hough says. And it\u2019s possible that these jolts might have caused the lights, she says.",

            "Many of the reports Hough turned up seem to fit with a shaking that would have rated 2 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. Scientists use this scale to rate quakes based on the damage they cause. An MMI of 2 is fairly weak. It would likely be \u201cfelt only by a few persons at rest,\u201d Hough says, \u201cespecially on upper floors of a building.\u201d",

They\u2019ve been storing these cells, seeds and other materials in protected facilities across the globe. But climate change, environmental disasters and wars can threaten these modern Noah\u2019s Arks. Now, some researchers have proposed an out-of-this-world solution: Build one of these arks on the moon.",

That\u2019s the minimum needed to safely store most animal cells long-term, Mary Hagedorn and her team noted July 31 in BioScience.",

            "Scientists once thought that the brain stopped changing once you reach adulthood. But we now know that even after we grow up, our brains adapt. Some changes occur in response to experiences. This allows us to form new memories and learn new information. Some changes occur from aging. For example, the brain\u2019s hippocampus \u2014 which plays a role in memory \u2014 begins to shrink. This gradual process begins in early adulthood.",
            "Sometimes, the brain changes in response to injury. After injury, the brain attempts to make repairs. First, the brain tries re-routing information around the damaged part. The brain tries using existing neuron connections to carry out the job that used to be done by the damaged part. But after a few days, the brain starts making new connections. This stage can go on for weeks, months or longer.",

Our pupils enlarge so we become more aware of our surroundings. And our body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, to boost our energy and focus.",
            "Together, these changes are known as the fight-or-flight response. They\u2019re automatically triggered by what\u2019s known as the sympathetic nervous system.

As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux.

            "fC\u202fA. Catalina V\u00e9lez-Ortega grew up in Colombia. Here, she wears a traditional Cumbia outfit. Cumbia is a Colombian folk dance.",
            "When I finally chose a major in undergrad, I picked biomedical engineering. It allowed me to do as much as possible in one degree. A little bit of medicine. A little bit of engineering. After that program, I did an internship in research. We could intern anywhere for one semester without having to take classes. I saw that as my chance to try research. We only had a few research options in Colombia. I interned at the Ohio State University and found that I loved working in the lab.",
            "That\u2019s when I learned that you could earn a salary in grad school. Some graduate programs will even pay for your tuition. I loved the idea of being paid to learn. Again, I didn\u2019t have a specific topic in mind. So I applied to all kinds of engineering programs in the U.S. I didn\u2019t get into any of them. Instead, I was accepted into an immunology program in Colombia.",
            "Eventually, I made it into a PhD program in physiology here in the U.S. [Physiologists study how different parts of the human body work.] That\u2019s when I finally found the field that I liked. Physiology of hearing and deafness let me apply my physics and engineering background to biology. It\u2019s a really good fit for all of my interests. I didn\u2019t plan for it to happen like that. I just really loved learning. And that\u2019s what I still do with my job today.\u00a0",
            "During the first year of my PhD program, I had to rotate between four different labs from at least two different departments. I picked my labs based on which techniques I could learn. I saw it as an opportunity to do things I didn\u2019t often get to in immunology. One of those labs had us developing a fancy imaging technique for the inner ear.",
            "My engineering side loved that. I felt like my previous undergrad experience in coding and electronics could improve this technique. I\u2019ve coded my entire life. When I was three years old, my dad bought a computer. I used to sit next to him, and we would learn how to code together. This was at the same time as I was learning to read Spanish. ",
            "That one rotation got me really interested in this whole new field. When I left to open my own lab, I ended up bringing that work on the inner ear with me.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "In Colombia, I didn\u2019t have many of the tools I needed to do experiments. It was a lot more theory. I got really good insights into how machines and experiments are supposed to work.",
            "My education in the U.S. was a little more hands-on. I now had the tools and could learn how to use them. Both experiences complimented each other very well. My experience in Colombia taught me the basics needed for the more hands-on work.\u00a0",
            "Getting into a PhD program was a big one. Not knowing how to apply as a foreign student made it a lot harder. I can relate to first-generation students who don\u2019t have parents that can help them. Who don\u2019t have someone to explain how college applications work or what college life is like. Nobody in my family attended a school outside Colombia. We just thought things worked the same as they did in Colombia. But the application processes are really different. I now try to help students who are applying from other countries.\u00a0",
            "If you feel like you\u2019re struggling, try to find mentors. A lot of professors and high school teachers are willing to help. Ask them to help you network. I think all of us are willing to take a few minutes to review documents and offer feedback.\u00a0"
