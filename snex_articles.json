            "But much of what we know about these cells has come from studies in mice. And those animals have only about 110,000 pyramidal cells in each CA3 area.",

Hermione Granger, meanwhile, uses the spell Obliviate to remove herself from her parents\u2019 memories to protect them from the wizarding world.\u00a0",

Then electricity courses through connections between the nerve cells, or neurons, in their brain, Fenton says. This electrical activity can strengthen those connections. The more exposure to an experience someone has, the stronger those connections become. These connections can also weaken over time, leading to forgetting.\u00a0",

            "In one experiment, Hampson\u2019s team placed wires about as thick as a strand of hair in the brains of 17 patients with epilepsy. (The researchers chose patients with epilepsy because they often have wires placed in their brains to map and understand their seizures.) The wires recorded the electrical activity of brain cells in the hippocampus. That\u2019s a part of the brain that processes memories.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Patients then looked at a picture on a computer screen. A few seconds later, the screen showed that same picture, plus three different pictures. Patients were asked to choose the picture they had first seen. They repeated this process 100 times, then took a short break.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Afterward, patients were shown 100 more pictures. These included pictures they had seen in the first part of the experiment. There were also pictures they had never seen. The patients were asked to touch the picture they were most familiar with.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When we see a picture, electrical activity courses through our brains, says Hampson. But this electrical activity was different for every picture. Hampson\u2019s team studied the electrical patterns produced when nine patients saw pictures in their sample. Then, the researchers could use math equations to mimic the patterns.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The researchers applied tiny zaps that mimicked those electrical patterns to the other eight patients. In picture memory tests, the patients\u2019 memories for images paired with the small jolts improved by 35 to 40 percent. Their memory did not improve for pictures not paired with the zaps.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In the future, brain implants that deliver such tiny zaps might be used to boost memory. The researchers aren\u2019t sure when this tech will be ready for widespread use. \u201cThe first users would likely be people suffering from a disease such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d Hampson says. \u201cOr from a head injury that results in damage to the parts of the brain associated with memory.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",

            "When people sense things, such as the colors of a beautiful painting or the touch of a soft flower, that activates some neurons. This changes where in the cells many molecules are found. That affects how the nerve cells work and, in turn, how they connect to each other. Such altered connections encode, or store, the memory of the experience. The things we give more attention are more likely to be encoded.\u00a0",
            "But \u201cyou can interfere with that encoding,\u201d says Samuel Schacher. He is a retired neuroscientist based in New York City. He and his colleagues found they could manipulate memory encoding in an experiment with sea hare neurons.\u00a0",

Connected to that motor neuron were two sensory neurons. Those nerve cells process information from the environment. By making molecular tweaks to those nerve cells, the scientists were able to erase the memory-storing connection between the motor neuron and one of the sensory neurons.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "This hinted it could be possible to erase some memories while leaving others intact. And perhaps someday, new therapies could coax neurons into letting go of specific unwanted memories.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "In some sense, \u201cwe\u2019ve been trying to manipulate memories forever,\u201d says Fenton. For example, when we practice a sport, we are purposely strengthening our memories of how to move our bodies in certain ways. Likewise, if we choose not to study something, we allow ourselves to forget certain information.\u00a0",

            "Is it okay to make or erase memories instantly, no experience needed? \u201cThe ethics of that are very thorny,\u201d says Fenton. Our lived experiences \u2014 and memories of them \u2014 make us who we are. Changing a person\u2019s memories could, in some ways, cause them to be a different person, Fenton says. \u201cWe must proceed very carefully.\u201d\u00a0"

Studying biology was the main way she learned to read \u2014 a challenge for her, growing up with dyslexia. This is a common learning disability that makes it difficult to process written language.",
            "Inspired by her experience with dyslexia, Giselle wanted to use the power of biology to help people with this condition. And when she took a summer course on genetics, she got an idea for how to do it.",
            "In that class, Giselle learned about epigenetics. This is the way someone\u2019s environment can change how their genes work. She wondered: Could a person\u2019s lifestyle influence genes linked to dyslexia?",
            "To find out, Giselle looked at short-chain fatty acids. These are molecules in the gut that can be impacted by a person\u2019s diet. Giselle wanted to know whether such diet-controlled molecules might affect a gene called DCDC2. In people, that gene is important for language processing.",
            "In her experiments, Giselle looked at a similar gene in C. elegans worms. The worm version is called RPI-1. When worms were exposed to more short-chain fatty acids, their RPI-1 tended to be less active. That led Giselle to suspect that controlling the amount of short-chain fatty acids in a person\u2019s gut might influence their DCDC2 gene \u2014 and therefore their dyslexia.",

(Permafrost is ground that\u2019s been frozen for at least two years straight.) But the clock is ticking for researchers keen on studying this ice. A warming climate risks melting it.",

            "The researchers also studied minerals in sediments above the ice. The alignment of magnetic minerals in it had flipped, they realized. This pointed to a time roughly 770,000 years ago when the Earth\u2019s north and south magnetic poles swapped spots. That clue indicates the newfound ice is at least that old. Previous research had dated the fossil forest below the glacier to at least 2.4 million years old. So that\u2019s the maximum age of this ice.",

            "Some 800 light-years away, this Neptune-sized world is spilling its guts into space. The James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, recently spotted the event.\u00a0Astronomers described what they\u2019ve gleaned from those entrails here on January 14 and 15 at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society.",
            "\u201cIf this is true, it\u2019s super cool,\u201d says Mercedez L\u00f3pez-Morales of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. She\u2019s an astronomer who was not involved in the new work. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d she says, \u201cyou can study directly what the interior of an exoplanet is made of. That\u2019s exciting.\u201d",
            "The exoplanet \u2014 K2 22b \u2014 was discovered in 2015. It sits scorchingly close to its star, completing an orbit in just nine hours. It\u2019s too small to be seen itself. However, it periodically emits\u00a0clouds of opaque dust. They\u00a0create a cometlike tail that blocks a small share (less than 1 percent) of its host star\u2019s light.",
            "Astronomers soon realized that the dust was probably cooled magma from the exoplanet\u2019s interior. This trail of planetary viscera offered a unique chance to tease out the chemical composition of K2 22b\u2019s mantle. (That\u2019s the material right below a planet\u2019s crust.)",
            "Getting clues to any planet\u2019s mantle, even Earth\u2019s, is challenging, says Jason Wright of Penn State in University Park. He\u2019s an author of the new study. And, he notes, \u201cWhen nature gives you a gift like that, you have to take it.\u201d",
            "Wright was part of a team that observed K2 22b with JWST\u2019s sensitive mid-infrared spectrometer last April. Different minerals in the dust emit particular wavelengths of light. This allowed the team figure out what the exoplanet is made of.",
            "The dust doesn\u2019t seem to be pure iron. That\u2019s what scientists would have expected if the planet was a bare core with no mantle or crust jacketing it. \u201cThere is still meat left on the bones, so to speak,\u201d said astronomer Nick Tusay. He was describing the planet January 14 at the meeting.",
            "Something in the dust emitted light that was hard to link to any specific material, he said. His team first checked to see if the dust grains were magnesium oxide and silicon monoxide. Those are what you\u2019d expect in mantle material. But the emitted light didn\u2019t fit these minerals.",
            "Surprisingly, the dust looks most like nitric oxide and carbon dioxide from vaporized ices, Tusay said. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, what we\u2019re looking at is a snowball disintegrating.\u201d",
            "Those gases are hard to explain for a planet so close to its star. \u201cIt\u2019s just so weird and unexpected,\u201d Tusay said. In an attempt to learn more, he has requested more JWST observing time.",
            "He and his team have also\u00a0reported their results in a paper\u00a0submitted January 14 to arXiv.org. This is a website where new data are stored and can be viewed prior to peer review.",
            "L\u00f3pez-Morales agrees that more observations are needed to confirm the planet\u2019s makeup. \u201cIt\u2019s very preliminary, very promising, definitely needs more data,\u201d she says. Studying a handful of other known disintegrating exoplanets would be interesting, too.",
            "A newly discovered disintegrating planet might be the best place to start. The space-based TESS telescope discovered this new planet in October. It\u2019s emitting a dust cloud so big that it extends halfway around its host star in a horseshoe-shaped tail some 9 million kilometers (5.6 million miles) long. Astronomer Marc Hon of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u00a0reported this at the meeting on January 15.",
            "This is the closest disintegrating planet to Earth yet discovered. For that reason, its contents will be even more clear in JWST\u2019s data.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019ve proved we can do it with K2 22b,\u201d Tusay says. \u201cThis one will be better.\u201d"

            "For James Whitfield, math is not something to dread. In fact, in college he often turned to math problems to relieve stress. He\u2019d relax by solving equations from a textbook his mother gave him. \u201cI enjoyed doing mathematics just for fun,\u201d says Whitfield.",
            "At the time, Whitfield was studying chemistry and math. A quantum chemistry course showed him how to combine his two interests. This branch of chemistry uses quantum mechanics to study how molecules interact. Quantum mechanics is a type of physics that deals with the behavior of matter at atomic and subatomic levels. The work allowed him to put his love of math to use, he says. \u201cThat made going into quantum mechanics a lot of fun.\u201d",
            "That solid background in math let Whitfield explore quantum computing during his Ph.D. Still, few opportunities for practicing quantum computing existed outside of academia at the time. But now that has changed. Today, his team develops new quantum computing tools at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. He\u2019s also working with Amazon Web Services to help deliver training on the Amazon Braket quantum computing service.",
            "Finding ways to boost computing power through quantum mechanics has become \u201cthis worldwide phenomenon,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t go into it expecting that to happen. It was being at the right place at the right time.\u201d In this interview, Whitfield shares his experience and advice with\u202fScience News Explores. (This interview has been edited for content and readability.) \u00a0",
            "The first thing is that there\u2019s a quantum [computing] industry at all. The fact that it\u2019s become a worldwide effort that people are putting time and effort into. Now, quantum computing is happening in government, private industries and academia. It\u2019s really all over the place. \u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s also been amazing to watch how the technology has developed. I think it gives a whole different feel to some of the technologies we use, such as Wi-Fi, the internet and computers. It\u2019s incredible seeing technology that started as just ideas on paper grow into something that\u2019s being implemented. Seeing all those scientific successes and challenges makes it really interesting and fun to be a scientist.\u00a0",
            "When it comes to math, a lot of people get into a situation where they need to pass a course. They start doing poorly, and then they start feeling bad about it. Then they perform even worse, and it becomes this self-fulfilling cycle. They start believing they\u2019re not good at it. \u00a0",
            "Mathematics is very particular and has a lot of rules. It includes a lot of complicated things you have to memorize and work through. But so are other things we like to do for fun. Many people enjoy things that are very close to mathematics. Doing Sudoku puzzles, playing video games or completing crossword puzzles are all in the same vein. They\u2019re just fun puzzles that keep your mind sharp. \u00a0\u00a0How mathematics is taught can also be really problematic. Throwing students into algebra while they\u2019re still figuring out how to add or multiply is not the best approach. Especially for those who won\u2019t use those skills later on. Pushing them to do something very difficult when they\u2019re not prepared makes it a stressful situation. It does a lot to dampen the enjoyment of mathematics. Most people don\u2019t need to do intensive calculus for any particular reason other than for fun. \u00a0\u00a0If you timed or graded people doing Sudoku, it wouldn\u2019t be fun to do either. Sudoku and crossword puzzles are quiet, Sunday afternoon kinds of games. Doing mathematics that way makes it a much richer experience.\u00a0",
            "This may sound hard, but try to enjoy it. Shying away from difficult things isn\u2019t the right way to get through them. When I did sports in high school and college, I sometimes found it very difficult. Waking up early, running, going to competitions \u2014 I chose to do all of those things. You don\u2019t do sports because it\u2019s easy but, rather, because it\u2019s difficult. And I think in many ways, you can think of mathematics in the same way.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Also, try not to be too stressed about it. If you\u2019re interested in science, some math is involved. But you don\u2019t have to be a mathematician. Not loving math doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be involved in science. \u00a0",
            "When it comes to science, there\u2019s a lot of self-drive that needs to be there. You\u2019ve got to have some passion to make it through. It\u2019s really hard to just stumble through a Ph.D. You won\u2019t get much out of it. \u00a0\u00a0A Ph.D. is a very long process. If you don\u2019t want to do five years of study, don\u2019t do it. But if you do, pick something you\u2019re passionate about. But if you want to get a job sooner rather than later, I don\u2019t suggest doing [a Ph.D.]. Instead, try a master\u2019s degree or a certificate program and then learn on the job. That\u2019s because a job market that\u2019s here now can change during the time it takes to finish a Ph.D. \u00a0\u00a0Here in America, there are many routes to getting an education. If you didn\u2019t enjoy your high school classes, there\u2019s community college. If you\u2019re not enjoying community college, there are trade schools and online certificates. Even YouTube can be a fantastic place to learn skills if you watch the right videos. The internet has a wealth of knowledge \u2014 but only if you go to the right places. Otherwise, you end up in things that are not healthy intellectually.\u00a0",
            "I often encourage my students to go down rabbit holes. I try to do that, too. Learn as much as you can about what you find interesting. I spent the past month implementing a theorem from the 1960s just because I thought it would be fun to do. It was something really nice to learn and share with my group. They can then add or take away from it. I get my best ideas by sharing science and having fun exploring.\u00a0"

These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

IQ is one such ability. Self-control is another. Both help people focus their attention when they need to, such as at school.",

The brain cells behind executive function are known as the executive control network. This network turns on\u00a0when someone is taking an IQ test. Many of the same brain areas are involved in fluid intelligence.",
            "But personal intelligence is more than just executive function. It\u2019s tied to personal goals. If people are working toward some goal, they\u2019ll be interested and focused on what they are doing. They might daydream about a project even while not actively working on it. Although daydreaming may seem like a waste of time to outsiders, it can have major benefits for the person doing it.",
            "When engaged in some task, such as learning, people want to keep at it, Kaufman explains. That means they will push forward, long after they might otherwise have been expected to give up. Engagement also lets a person switch between focused attention and mind wandering.",

For a long time, psychologists thought the default mode network was active only when the executive control network rested. In other words, you could not focus on an activity and daydream at the same time.",
            "To see if that was really true, last year Kaufman teamed up with researchers at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro and at the University of Graz in Austria. They scanned the brains of volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. This tool uses a strong magnetic field to record brain activity.",
            "As they scanned the brains of 25 college students, the researchers asked the students to think of as many creative uses as they could for everyday objects. And as students were being as creative as possible, parts of both the default mode network and the executive control network lit up. The two systems weren\u2019t at odds with each other. Rather, Kaufman suspects, the two networks work together to make creativity possible.",

But smart people don\u2019t always live up to their potential.",
            "When Duckworth dug deeper, she found that the people who performed best \u2014 those who were promoted over and over, or made a lot of money \u2014 shared a trait independent of intelligence. They had what she now calls grit. Grit has two parts: passion and perseverance. Passion points to a lasting interest in something.

            "In one study of people 25 and older, she found that as people age, they become more likely to stick with a project. She also found that grit increases with education.

            "She then did another study with college students. Duckworth wanted to see how intelligence and grit affected performance in school. So she compared scores on college-entrance exams (like the SAT), which estimate IQ, to school grades and someone\u2019s score on the grit scale. Students with higher grades tended to have more grit. That\u2019s not surprising. Getting good grades takes both smarts and hard work. But Duckworth also found that intelligence and grit don\u2019t always go hand in hand. On average, students with higher exam scores tended to be less gritty than those who scored lower.",

He recently pooled the results of 88 studies on grit. Together, those studies involved nearly 67,000 people. And grit did not predict success, Cred\u00e9 found.",
            "However, he thinks grit is very similar to conscientiousness. That someone\u2019s ability to set goals, work toward them and think things through before acting. It\u2019s a basic personality trait, Cred\u00e9 notes \u2014 not something that can be changed.",
            "\u201cStudy habits and skills, test anxiety and class attendance are far more strongly related to performance than grit,\u201d Cred\u00e9 concludes. \u201cWe can teach [students] how to study effectively. We can help them with their test anxiety,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can do that with grit.\u201d",

The resulting \u201cimmune amnesia\u201d from measles can\u00a0leave people at risk of developing infections from other harmful viruses and bacteria for years, scientists are finding. Pneumonia, ear infections and diarrhea are common side-effects. \u00a0",
            "That makes measles \u201cthe furthest thing from benign,\u201d says Michael Mina. As a pathologist, he studies infectious diseases at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. Measles increases people\u2019s susceptibility to everything else, he says. And that has big costs.",
            "Scientists now have a better picture of how the measles virus mounts its sneak attack. They know which cells are most at risk and how long the immune system seems to suffer. Studies helped fill in the details. They came from tests in lab animals and in human tissues and from comparing children before and after they had measles.",

            "fCOnce the measles virus invades the body, infected immune cells spread widely \u2014 even before symptoms appear. The amount of virus, or viral load (shown as a beige curve behind the bodies), peaks between 7 and 10 days after infection. Afterward, the body is left with fewer memory immune cells. Source: B.M. Laksono, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands ",
            "This new view may help explain why the measles vaccine seems to have far-reaching effects. The shot prevents deaths \u2014 and from more diseases than just measles, says Rik de Swart. He\u2019s a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands. By shielding the immune system from one virus, the vaccine may help keep other disease-causing germs at bay.",
            "After someone with measles coughs or sneezes, their virus can linger in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours. Once inside its next victim, that virus attacks immune cells. It targets those in the nose, throat, lungs and eyes. These immune cells have a protein called CD150 on their surface. This protein allows the virus to invade, experiments on lab animals show.",
            "Inside the cells, the virus quickly makes copies of itself. Then it spreads to places packed with other immune cells, such as the bone marrow, the spleen, tonsils and lymph nodes. The measles virus has an \u201cenormously strong\u201d preference for infecting immune cells, says Bert Rima. He is an infectious-disease researcher at Queen\u2019s University Belfast in Northern Ireland.",
            "By looking at preserved human tissue, Rima and his colleagues traced how measles invades the immune system. Eventually, newly made viral particles move to the respiratory tract. From there they can\u00a0be coughed out to sicken more people. The researchers described their findings in the May/June 2018 issue of mSphere.",
            "A severe measles infection usually lasts several weeks. It can sometimes bring ear infections and pneumonia. In rare cases, a deadly brain swelling may also occur. On their own, those are worrisome side-effects, says Anthony Fauci. He is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md. But the loss of immune cells also can leave people prone to infections that the immune system would normally fend off.",
            "In 2013, de Swart and colleagues had a chance to study the immune effects of the measles virus in children. These kids were part of a closed-off community of Orthodox Protestants in the Netherlands. Parents in this community refuse to let their kids become vaccinated. As a result, bouts of measles have been common. The community\u2019s last measles outbreak had ended in 2000. So it was just a matter of time before the virus took hold again.",
            "The researchers got permission from parents to take blood samples from healthy children who never had measles. They wanted to study their immune cells. Then, the researchers waited for an outbreak. They would test the kids again after an infection.",
            "And they didn\u2019t have to wait long. An outbreak ripped through the community just as the researchers began collecting blood. Classrooms emptied as sick siblings packed into dark living rooms to protect their sensitive eyes. De Swart\u2019s team had blood samples from before and after 77 of those children came down with measles.",
            "The measles virus targets immune cells called memory B and T cells, de Swart says. These cells remember threats the body has already fought off. They also help the immune system spring into action quickly if those threats return. After the measles outbreak, the numbers of some types of the memory cells dropped in children who had caught the disease. That created an immune amnesia.",
            "De Swart\u2019s team reported its findings November 23, 2018 in Nature Communications.",
            "The immune system might take months, or even years, to bounce back from this memory loss. Researchers, including de Swart and Mina, compared health records of children in the United Kingdom from 1990 to 2014. For up to five years after a bout of measles, children experienced more infections than did those who never had the disease. And children who\u2019d had measles were 15 to 24 percent more likely to receive a prescription for medicine to treat an infection. The findings were reported last November 8 in BMJ Open.\u00a0",

            "Mina and his colleagues found similar results for deaths from nonmeasles infections among children in England, Wales, the United States and Denmark. When measles was rampant, children were more likely to die from other infections, the researchers found. And this added danger from measles stuck around for a long time. Even several years out, measles survivors were more likely to die from other infections than did children who had not gotten measles.",
            "At some point, the immune system can recover its memories. But it\u2019s not clear how. With new methods that can measure these memories, Mina and others hope to figure that out.",

            "Full disclosure: My daughter Bethany died from cancer in 2018. Treatments weakened her immune system. So an infectious disease could have made her sicker or killed her. I echo what her husband Jarrod wrote on Facebook: \u201cI got an extra two-and-a-half years with Bethany because everyone who loved her listened to our requests and was vaccinated against diseases that are easily dealt with.\u201d"

            "Vaccines save lives \u2014 millions every year. Yet some parents won\u2019t let their children get this common treatment. New research suggests many of these people think they know more than the experts. That may make them more likely to fall for baseless myths, the study concludes",
            "Matthew Motta is a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He studies science communication and the public-policy impacts of people rejecting science. Recently, he and others surveyed 1,310 U.S. adults on their knowledge of autism. Some websites wrongly appeal to parents\u2019 fears that childhood vaccines may cause the complex brain condition \u2014 even though study after study has shown that there is no link. Motta\u2019s group also asked how these people felt about government requirements that all children get vaccines.",
            "More than a third of the people surveyed claimed they knew as much or more about the causes of autism than either doctors or scientists. In fact, the opposite was true. People who thought they knew more than the experts generally knew the least about autism. That overconfidence was also strongest among people who oppose vaccines.",
            "The Dunning-Kruger effect helps explain the results, Motta says. Psychologists Justin Kruger and David Dunning first described the effect in 1999. At the time, both worked at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.",

            "\u201cSome people have so little knowledge about a subject that they actually don\u2019t know how much knowledge they lack,\u201d Motta explains. In other words, people who don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know can mistakenly think they know plenty. They\u2019re wrong. Yet they feel quite confident that they know more than people who have spent their lives doing research in that field.",
            "Motta\u2019s group also had another finding. Overconfident people are more likely to think that actors or talk show hosts should influence public policy on vaccines. In fact, such celebrities have no expert training and or knowledge. Often they, too, are overconfident \u2014 and wrong.",
            "The study appeared in the August 2018 issue of Social Science & Medicine.",
            "Salil Benegal is a political scientist at DePauw University in Greenfield, Ind. He wrote a commentary on the study\u2019s findings. It ran in the September 2018 issue of Social Science & Medicine. The new study, he says, helps explain how overconfidence can \u201camplify the effects of misinformation from non-expert sources.\u201d He says it can have the same effect on exaggerating the believability of some political groups.",
            "Indeed, Benegal says, the new findings may \u201cbe relevant to a lot of other areas where there is skepticism or misinformation about scientific facts.\u201d He says that includes topics such as climate change or biotechnology. \u00a0",
            "The new study, he adds, also highlights the problem some news outlets create when they look for comments from \u201cboth sides\u201d \u2014 experts and non-experts \u2014 on matters of science. After all, science is about facts. And someone\u2019s personal beliefs won\u2019t change the facts.",
            "The new findings don\u2019t mean that overconfident people are stupid, Motta says. They may even know a lot about things other than vaccines. And telling people that they\u2019re idiots would never change their minds anyway.",
            "Some people might be willing to consider scientific evidence. Others might not listen. Ethan Lindenberger, 18, of Norwalk, Ohio, faced that problem. His mom wouldn\u2019t let him get vaccinated. She rejected mounds of scientific evidence showing that vaccines are safe. \u201cHer only response was: \u2018That\u2019s what they want you to think,\u2019\u201d Lindenberger said at a March 5 congressional hearing in Washington, D.C.",
            "When talking about vaccines with someone, such as a parent, don\u2019t give up, Motta urges teens and tweens. \u201cMake an effort to connect with your parents,\u201d he suggests. \u201cTalk with them on their own terms,\u201d he says, \u201cwhile staying true to the science.\u201d",
            "If a parent worries about side effects, Motta says, contrast the teeny risk of any true side effect with the much greater danger of getting a potentially lethal disease.",
            "If a parent thinks vaccines are disgusting, Motta suggests that teens talk how getting a dangerous, preventable disease is much more disgusting. Describe the blotchy, ugly rashes of measles or skin scars of chickenpox. Describe the pain and spasms tetanus can cause or yucky diarrhea from rotavirus. Even the throat-clogging mucus from diphtheria (Dip-THEER-ee-uh).",
            "Motta and others are now at work on a new study. They hope it will show this strategy can work. If so, it may one day help health experts and others fight the growing problem of preventable disease.",

            "Measles is extremely contagious. And one number, or rather a range of them, sums up the risk of its spread.",
            "Two diseases have dominated headlines in the past few months. Measles sickened at least 1,044 people\u00a0in the United States between January 1 and June 13. The virus has shown up in 26 U.S. states. And in the African country of Congo, Ebola has\u00a0racked up 2,084 cases\u00a0since August 2018. Of those, 1,405 people have died. This outbreak has also spilled over into neighboring Uganda.",
            "Those numbers are scary. But another number illustrates how contagious a disease is. Really, it\u2019s a range of numbers. It\u2019s called the basic reproduction number, or R0\u00a0(pronounced \u201cR naught\u201d). This ratio describes how easily an infectious disease can spread.",
            "Every infectious disease has a basic reproduction number, or R0. This is the average number of people who would catch the bug from one infected person, in a population where no one is immune to the disease.",
            "Each dot in this graphic represents a person who would catch the disease from an infected person. R0 is usually expressed as a range because the factors that go into this ratio vary depending on the time and place of an outbreak.",
            "*060819_ht_measles_scivis_inline1_730png",
            "fCCredit: T. Tibbits; Sources: P. Fine/Epidemiol. Rev. 1993; S. Hay et al./Philos. T. R. Soc. B 2013; G. Chowell and H. Nishiura/BMC Med. 2014",
            "If one person is sick in an unvaccinated population, R0 estimates how many others that person would infect, on average. Researchers\u00a0can use R0\u00a0to estimate\u00a0how big an outbreak may become. They also would use it to plan a response if terrorists had found some\u00a0way to turn a disease into a\u00a0weapon.",
            "Every infectious event or outbreak has an R0. Three main variables go into calculating it. The first is how long people stay contagious once they\u2019re infected (the number of days, for example). The second is how often an infected person is likely to come into contact with others on a daily basis. And the third variable is the likelihood of infecting those people. In turn, those variables are influenced by other factors. Those include the local environment and the average age of infected people. An\u00a0R0 also can be affected by how closely people live to each other and things such as what public-health resources are available to them.",
            "Within epidemics, R0\u00a0can vary from\u00a0country to country. If there\u2019s more than one way to catch a certain disease, R0 also can vary between the\u00a0transmission routes. That\u2019s why when scientists talk about the R0\u00a0for a disease, they\u2019re usually talking about a range of numbers.",
            "For measles, that range is 12 to 18: One person is likely to sicken 12 to 18 others. That\u2019s high compared to something like Ebola. There, one person may infect another 1.5 to 2.5 people.",
            "That might seem surprising when you consider how many people Ebola has killed. But R0\u00a0measures how contagious something is, not how deadly it is.",
            "Part of what affects this\u00a0R0 is how a disease spreads between people. Measles can travel through the air. Ebola instead spreads through bodily fluids. So the odds of making contact with the Ebola virus is far lower.",
            "David Smith is an epidemiologist, or disease detective, at the University of Washington in Seattle. \u201cWith measles,\u201d he explains, \u201cif you\u2019re anywhere near someone with the disease, you could get it.\u201d That\u2019s why getting the measles vaccine is so important.",
            "Researchers also can use the R0 to figure out what share of people needs to be vaccinated to prevent a disease from spreading. This is known as herd immunity.",
            "For measles, generally 92 to 95 percent of a population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity. Because Ebola has a lower R0\u00a0range, it also has a lower herd immunity threshold. Estimates suggest that only 42 to 63 percent of a population would need\u00a0to be vaccinated\u00a0to reach herd immunity against Ebola. Current vaccines are not 100 percent effective against all of Ebola\u2019s various strains. Because of this, some researchers\u00a0argue that the threshold may actually be higher\u00a0\u2014 and that current vaccination efforts won\u2019t get us there.",
            "The R0\u00a0range is not perfect. Researchers\u00a0described\u00a0its flaws in the January 2019\u00a0Emerging Infectious Diseases. For one thing, people don\u2019t always define R0 in the same way. So even researchers may misinterpret what it means. And R0\u00a0can\u2019t tell you how well a vaccine or other control is working while an outbreak is underway. For that you\u2019d need to look at another reproduction number, called R effective or Rt. This number changes during an outbreak.",
            "Using R0 to describe an epidemic \u201cisn\u2019t great,\u201d Smith acknowledges. The number assumes everyone\u2019s immune system is encountering the disease for the first time and there are no vaccines. In an epidemic, that\u2019s rarely true.",
            "Measles\u2019 high R0\u00a0shows why it\u2019s good that there\u2019s a vaccine. Before one became widely available in the 1960s, millions of people got the measles each year \u2014 and hundreds of them died."

            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",

He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often."

            "Geologists consider a blob of lava to be a lava bomb if it is at least 6.4 centimeters (2.5 inches) across and rounded. That is, as long as it has no sharp angles. Lava bombs can be mostly round, like basketballs, or elongated, like footballs. Sometimes strings of lava stretch to form ribbon-shaped lava bombs. And lava bombs can get big. The largest one ever recorded was a whopping 6 meters (20 feet) across.",
            "Lava bombs can spend up to 10 seconds soaring through the air before landing. As the lava encounters the cold air of the atmosphere, it cools and hardens from the outside in. Smaller lava bombs can cool completely before landing. Larger ones only harden on the outside. This creates a solid coating that cracks like the crust on a loaf of bread. When the inside of a lava bomb is still hot and squishy when it hits the ground, it can land with a splat \u2014 flattening out like a cow pat.",
            "Most lava bombs land within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of an eruption. But some travel as far as 10 kilometers (6 miles). Of all threats posed by a volcanic eruption, researchers estimate, lava bombs are the most dangerous to people.",
            "Lava bombs form when globs of lava shoot out of a volcano and begin to harden before hitting the ground.",

During more than a decade of work on NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, Jane Rigby obsessed over minimizing light leaks. And she had extraordinary success.\u00a0",

            "\u201cI don\u2019t know how she does everything that she does, and does everything well,\u201d says Keren Sharon. She\u2019s an astronomer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cShe gets giddy,\u201d Sharon says of Rigby. \u201cIt could be about figuring out a [technical] bug, or discovering this super-exciting thing about a galaxy. \u2026 Her face lights up.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Rigby got interested in a career in space science around age 12, after she saw Sally Ride speak at a local college. Ride was the first American woman in space.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "As a college student, Rigby got her first experience using a telescope for research. At the McDonald Observatory in Texas, she and her colleagues aimed a telescope at a distant quasar. The project was plagued by light leaks and ultimately yielded no data. \u201cBut it was really fun,\u201d Rigby says. \u201cI was learning everything, trying to learn how the telescope worked.\u201d\u00a0",

            "\u201cI will use any telescope I can get my hands on,\u201d Rigby says. All that telescope time meant she was ready to join the JWST team when the opportunity came in 2010.\u00a0",
            "To work on JWST, Rigby took a job at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Before launch, most of her time was devoted to making sure that changes to the telescope\u2019s design wouldn\u2019t mess up the science. After the telescope launched in 2021, her job shifted to characterizing how well the telescope works \u2014 and JWST is basically a dream come true.\u00a0",

Plus, there\u2019s practically no light leaks. \u201cIt\u2019s not an accident that the telescope works so well,\u201d Rigby says, pointing to a huge amount of work by tens of thousands of people.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "With the telescope working so well, Rigby could turn her attention to scientific questions. She helps lead an observing program that looks at galaxies whose light has been magnified by foreground objects. That helps astronomers glimpse how the galaxies form stars.\u00a0\u00a0",

She has been out as part of the LGBTQ+ community since 2000, and she has devoted much of her career to holding the door open for others. She has helped set up groups and meetings for making astronomy more inclusive. A current priority is making sure trans people feel safe and welcome in the field.\u00a0",

He was part of a team that shared its new findings November 1 in\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
            "Astronomers in China and Japan first noted this supernova in 1181 as a \u201cguest star\u201d in the sky. But modern astronomers didn\u2019t find the remains of that explosion, now called the Pa 30 nebula, until 2013.",
            "When they did find the remnant, it looked weird. The supernova appeared to be a kind called type 1a. This type of stellar explosion involves a white dwarf star\u00a0blowing up and destroying itself in the process. But in the case of Pa 30, part of the star survived.",

            "He and his colleagues used a telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to look at the nebula. They recorded how fast the filaments are moving relative to Earth. Then they built a 3-D model of those filaments and their motions through space.",
            "The system is structured \u201ckind of like a three-layered onion,\u201d Cunningham says. The inner layer is the star. Then there\u2019s a gap of one or two light-years, which ends in a spherical shell of dust. The final layer is the filaments, which emerge from the dust shell.",
            "How the filaments formed remains a mystery. Also unclear is how those spikes have managed to stay in such straight lines for centuries.",
            "Maybe a shock wave from the explosion ricocheted off the wispy material between this star and its neighbors. As the shock wave bounced back toward the white dwarf, it could have sculpted the material into the spikes astronomers see. But future studies will have to confirm or rule out that scenario."

That competition is run by Society for Science, which also publishes Science News Explores. In this interview, Samvith shares his science fair experiences and advice.",

He got the idea to use scent for detecting allergens by just watching an ant in his kitchen home in on sugar from afar. \u201cEven the smallest things can spur good ideas.\u201d",
            "Being completely new to your project area can actually be a good thing, Samvith says.

So when he came up with the idea to detect scent, \u201cit was in part because I didn\u2019t place any imaginary restrictions on myself,\u201d Samvith says. \u201cSometimes, inexperience triggers out-of-the-box thinking, and even a complete beginner could come up with the idea of the future.\u201d"

            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, CO2 works like a blanket. It traps heat, warming our climate. Humans add a lot of CO2 to the air when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, for energy. Carbon capture can reduce this climate-warming CO2 pollution.",
            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

            "In many, the left ventricle balloons out. That\u2019s the chamber that pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body. The ballooned shape reminded Japanese doctors of a takotsubo. This is a type of round jar used for catching lobsters and octopuses. So in 1990, doctors at Hiroshima City Hospital\u202fproposed the term takotsubo\u202fto describe the condition.\u202f\u00a0",
            "What triggers takotsubo syndrome is still something of a mystery.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "One hypothesis is that a traumatic event causes a surge of\u202fstress hormones in the brain and adrenal glands. The left ventricle is loaded with receptors for these chemicals. So a sudden flood of them could cause its taut, elastic muscle to become loose and puffy. That would prevent it from delivering enough blood to the body.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "fCIn \u201cbroken heart syndrome\u201d or takotsubo cardiomyopathy, the left ventricle of the heart \u2014 which pumps oxygenated blood to the body (pictured here at the bottom right) \u2014 balloons outward and becomes weak. ",
            "Another hypothesis is that a stress response briefly \u201cstuns\u201d the heart. A third idea is that reduced levels of the hormone estrogen play a role.\u202fThat\u2019s because most cases of takotsubo syndrome are in older women. These women have usually gone through menopause \u2014 a stage of life when they stop menstruating. After menopause, they produce less estrogen than before.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Takotsubo syndrome is fairly rare. It accounts for only about 2 percent of people who seek medical care for an apparent heart attack. Peter Rahko recalls a case from the 1980s. He\u2019s a cardiologist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\u00a0",
            "Rahko remembers an older woman was called to a hospital in rural Wisconsin. There, she was shown the body of her son, who had died in a car accident. \u201cWithin five minutes, she started having severe chest pain [and] collapsed on the floor,\u201d Rahko says.\u202f\u00a0",
            "The woman was flown to Madison, where Rahko treated her. He snaked a catheter into her heart to see if something was blocking the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. That is what usually causes a heart attack. To his surprise, \u201cher arteries were totally normal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut her heart function was dramatically reduced.\u201d In takotsubo syndrome, the heart vessels are often clear. In fact, most patients do not have classic risk factors for heart problems.\u202f\u00a0",
            "Looking back, Rahko realizes his patient had takotsubo. Today, reduced heart function with no clear signs of disease is a tip-off for this condition. A doctor will see if a patient has experienced acute stress. For instance, if they have been grieving a loss.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In some cases, the tragic event that triggers takotsubo syndrome is obvious. But even events with more long-term effects have been tipping points. Examples include\u202fthe COVID-19 pandemic\u202fand\u202fearthquakes in New Zealand. Many patients, Singh notes, also have mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
            "Though severe, takotsubo is quite short-lived and typically not fatal. About 4 percent of people die of the condition. About 75 percent fully recover after 10 days, as Rahko\u2019s patient did. Many recover after only 48 to 72 hours.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely incredible,\u201d Singh says. She recalls one patient who came in with a severely impaired heart. \u201cI came back and rescanned her six hours later,\u201d Singh says. \u201cAnd it had gone from severely impaired \u2026 to almost normal.\u201d\u202f\u00a0",
            "The standard care for takotsubo is to treat the patient with medicines for heart failure. But since some people recover so quickly, \u201cit raises a question,\u201d Rahko says. \u201cShould we even be bothering with trying to put people on these medications? Are they even going to do any good?\u201d With basic medical support, like fluids and drugs to prevent blood clotting, the heart may unbreak itself.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
            "Rahko says wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some deaths from \u201cgrief\u201d in history were takotsubo. When people didn\u2019t have the knowledge of modern medicine, it was reasonable to think that \u201csome god struck down somebody \u2026 and they dropped dead,\u201d he says. Now \u201chere\u2019s one potential physiologic explanation.\u201d\u00a0"

            "The latest numbers come from the 2024 National Youth Tobacco Survey, or NYTS. It collected data from January to May of that year. Only 8 percent\u00a0of middle and high school students \u2014 about 2.25 million teens and tweens \u2014 reported using tobacco products in the previous month.",
            "That was a big difference from just a few years before. In 2019, 23 percent \u2014 just over 6 million teens and tweens \u2014 said they were currently using tobacco products.",
            "E-cigarettes, or vapes, are the most popular tobacco products among young people. A drop in the number of high schoolers who currently vape is a big reason for the overall decline in tobacco use.",
            "In 2023, 10 percent of high school students said they had vaped in the past month. A year later, just under 8 percent did. That amounted to 350,000 fewer high-school students.",
            "The overall decrease in tobacco use by young people is good news, says Rachel Boykan. She\u2019s a pediatric doctor at Stony Brook Children\u2019s Hospital in New York.",
            "Exposure to nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco products, is especially unhealthy for adolescents. It harms teens\u2019 ability to learn, remember and pay attention. It can also make it harder to quit a nicotine addiction later in life. \u00a0",

            "Tobacco use differs between different racial and ethnic groups of U.S. teens and tweens. The tobacco industry has long targeted certain groups through ads and marketing, research shows. For instance, companies have promoted menthol cigarettes to Black communities and used tribal icons to target American and Alaskan Native groups.",
            "Laws that limit who can buy tobacco products has helped limit teen use, Boykan says.",
            "In 2005, Needham, Mass., became the first town to raise the age required to purchase tobacco products to 21. Over time, more cities and states followed. In 2019, this rule became national law.",
            "When Needham raised the purchase age for tobacco products, regular cigarettes were the main concern. The law significantly cut smoking among Needham\u2019s high schoolers compared to those living nearby. When older teens were no longer able to legally buy cigarettes, that curbed their own use. It also knocked out a main supply of cigarettes to younger kids.",
            "It\u2019s now possible to buy e-cigarettes illegally online. That makes it harder to restrict sales, Boykan says.",
            "Another approach that has helped is a campaign called The Real Cost. It\u2019s run by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This campaign has boosted awareness of the harms of nicotine, vaping and smoking among teens and tweens, research has shown. It also has made young people less open to tobacco products.",

            "Nicotine pouches are now the second most popular tobacco product among teens and tweens, the new NYTS reports. Some 480,000 middle and high school students used them in 2024. These small pouches hold a powder containing nicotine, appealing flavorings and other ingredients. When a user places one between their lips or cheeks and their gum, nicotine seeps into their bloodstream through the lining of their mouth.",
            "The number of teens and tweens using nicotine pouches stayed steady from 2023 to 2024. That\u2019s worrying, Boykan says. It seems these pouches are \u201cnot perceived as harmful.\u201d",
            "Vapes that look like a gaming devices or smartphones pose a new risk, too. Some come with games styled after classics like Tetris and Pac-Man. One brand offers a virtual pet that the user feeds by taking puffs, plus a puff-count competition game.",

            "When Boykan talks to young people, she asks them about their dreams and goals. A nicotine addiction can get in the way of those plans. \u201cI can point them to videos of kids who had to drop out of college,\u201d She says, \u201cbecause they were so addicted.\u201d"

            "Dandruff makes the scalp itch, but it\u2019s not a dry skin problem. Treating it may call for a change in how often you wash your hair, use of an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo, or even turning to a prescription shampoo. ",
            "Dandruff flakes on your hair or shoulders don\u2019t look good. The itchy scalp that comes with it is no fun, either. In fact, although dandruff shows up on your hair, the condition actually starts with your scalp.",
            "Dandruff is a type of dermatitis (Der-muh-TY-tis), or skin inflammation. One study estimated that half of us will at some point develop this condition. And one key time it may emerge is puberty.",
            "Everyone\u2019s scalp hosts a mix of microbes. This is known as its microbiome (MY-kroh-BY-ohm). Sometimes the normal proportion of some types to others gets messed up. This is known as a dysbiosis (Dis-by-OH-sis). In people with dandruff, certain types of yeast and bacteria are far more common, compared to people with healthy scalps.",
            "Amy McMichael\u00a0and others discussed some of the culprits in a July 2024 report in the Archives of Dermatological Research. She\u2019s a dermatologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Both are in Winston-Salem, N.C.",
            "People often make the mistake of thinking an itchy, scaly scalp is dry, McMichael says. If they add oil, though, they risk making matters worse. Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",
            "Hair-care practices might explain some of the difference, McMichael says. She and others have found differences in how often women of African and European ancestry shampoo their hair. Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",
            "And also use hair conditioners, McMichael advises. \u201cIt actually smooths the outer layer \u2014 the cuticle \u2014 much better than you can get with oil.\u201d Be careful about using hair sprays and gels, she adds. These can dry hair, increasing the risk that strands will break.",
            "In any case, if you notice a hair or scalp problem, talk to your doctor or another health-care expert right away. You might need help for dandruff. Or you might have a more serious skin or hair condition.",
            "\u201cThe earlier that you come in, the better off you are,\u201d McMichael says."
