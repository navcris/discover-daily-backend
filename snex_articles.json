            "In the Sonic the Hedgehog games, players complete levels by passing through loops as the Blue Blur. To clear a loop, a real-life Sonic would need to rely on the physics behind roller coasters and race cars.",
            "Sonic isn\u2019t your typical hedgehog. He boasts incredible superspeed that lets him launch off springs, sprint over water and even clear loop-de-loops. In the Sonic the Hedgehog games, our favorite blue hedgehog runs through these loops to complete levels. If he enters one too slowly, though, he risks falling off the track. \u00a0Animals \u2014 including hedgehogs \u2014 don\u2019t typically run through loops. Instead, climbing creatures rely on specialized limbs to scale vertical surfaces. That leaves few role models in the animal kingdom for Sonic\u2019s upside-down antics. But roller-coaster carts, race cars and even advanced parkour runners can clear loops.\u00a0",
            "\u200b\u200b\u200bSonic could take advantage of the same physics for his stunts, says \u200b\u200bPaolo Segre. He studies biomechanics at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay. The key to clearing a large loop is \u201cspeed, speed, speed,\u201d Segre says. \u201cThat\u2019s all that really matters \u2014 and some decent shoes.\u201d \u00a0",
            "As Sonic approaches the top of the loop, two downward forces act on him: gravity and the \u201cnormal force\u201d exerted by the track. Together, these forces create a centripetal force that keeps Sonic on his circular path through the loop. Sonic\u2019s inertia, which is his resistance to a change in motion, helps him maintain his high speed as he moves through the loop. That allows him to clear the top without falling off the track.\u00a0",
            "Like a roller-coaster car, Sonic needs to reach a minimum speed to do this. But that speed would barely be a light jog for such a fast hedgehog, says Segre. Sonic can sustain speeds of some 1,200 kilometers (760 miles) per hour. That\u2019s about the speed of sound. \u00a0",

            "fCGeckos have toe pads covered in tiny bristles called setae. Made of keratin, these tiny hairs create weak molecular bonds that help the small lizards stick to vertical surfaces.",
            "Loops pop up in most Sonic the Hedgehog levels. But loops are rare in nature, says \u200b\u200bMostafa Hassanalian. At the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, Hassanalian designs robots inspired by animals. A lack of natural loops means most animals haven\u2019t evolved to run through these obstacles, he says. Instead, animals such as insects and geckos use specialized limbs to climb vertical surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Many insects run up surfaces using tiny claws and hairs on their legs that grip little pits and cracks. Geckos have thousands of tiny fibers under their feet that bond with a surface\u2019s molecules. Called van der Waals forces, these weak bonds are easily broken when the gecko lifts its foot.\u00a0\u00a0Sonic\u2019s hair may also help him clear loops \u2014 but not by gripping the track. Hedgehog quills are actually hardened, modified hairs. In the real world, these needle-like hairs protect hedgehogs from predators. Sonic\u2019s quills, though, may make him more aerodynamic, notes Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0Speedy animals such as cheetahs and horses need to reduce drag, or resistance to their motion caused by moving through air. An object\u2019s shape determines how much drag it experiences. Sonic\u2019s quills might reduce drag on his body by preventing large vortices, or whirls of air, from whipping up around him. The quills\u2019 jagged edges could cut these whirls into smaller vortices less likely to disturb airflow, says Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0He likens it to the vortex generators found on a race car. As a car speeds along, air passes along its surface. If this flow drifts away from the car, it can make the airflow turbulent, resulting in increased drag. Vortex generators are fins on a car that create small vortices, which redirect air back toward the car\u2019s surface. That helps stabilize the car at high speeds. \u00a0",
            "*A_hedgehog_sants_on_a_moss_covered_rock_Green_grass_is_in_the_background",
            "fCHedgehogs haven\u2019t evolved to zip through loops. These small insectivores can only move at a top speed of about six kilometers (four miles) per hour. ",
            "The physics behind race cars don\u2019t just apply to Sonic. Birds also take cues from racing to scale vertical surfaces. Most birds tackle tricky inclines using wing-assisted incline running, says Segre. \u200b\u200bWhen running up a slope, two-legged animals angle their bodies parallel to the surface. But this makes it hard to maintain the proper grip needed for climbing.\u00a0\u00a0So what can birds do? Flap their wings. \u201cThe wingbeats push them into the ground, kind of like the spoiler on a race car,\u201d says Segre. Like vortex generators, a spoiler is a device that affects how air flows over a vehicle. This disrupted airflow helps create a downward force that presses race cars into the ground, improving grip, or traction, between the tires and the road.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cOnce [birds] have that traction, they can actually use their legs to run,\u201d Segre says. This lets birds navigate different terrain, forage for food and escape predators. \u201cWe especially see it in baby birds who are not yet good at flying.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In experiments, this clever trick even let birds run up inverted walls \u2014 surfaces that slant toward the climber as they rise. No other two-legged animal manages this feat. \u201cWe see tons of climbing animals that are [four-legged],\u201d says Segre. This is because four-legged animals can \u201ckeep their body right up against the wall like a rock climber.\u201d By keeping their center of gravity close to the surface, they\u2019re less likely to tip over backward. Wing-assisted incline running helps birds hug similarly close to steep surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0Still, even wing-assisted birds aren\u2019t able to run upside down like Sonic. And their tactic for scaling inclines isn\u2019t what Segre would expect for our blue hero. While birds mostly use their legs to ascend, their wings are essential to getting enough traction. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really what Sonic does,\u201d says Segre. \u201cHe just uses pure speed.\u201d \u00a0",

            "The Chukchi Sea population of polar bears was a perfect fit. These animals live in the waters that lie between Alaska and Russia. The bears have lost much of their sea-ice habitat. And that has led many bears to spend long periods each summer on land. There, they have come into contact with people and their garbage \u2014 possible sources of pathogens. The Chukchi population also ranges farther south than many other polar bears.",
            "\u201cIf there are pathogens moving northward into the range of polar bears, then [the Chukchi Sea] would be a place we would expect to detect that,\u201d Rode says.",
            "The researchers screened blood serum and feces from 232 Chukchi bears between 2008 and 2017. The scientists looked for antibodies in blood against a range of pathogens. These included bacteria, viruses and parasites. If the blood has antibodies aimed at fighting a specific pathogen, it suggests the bear\u2019s immune system has already faced that pathogen in the past.\u00a0",
            "The team then compared this analysis to a similar one of 115 bears that were surveyed earlier \u2014 between 1987 and 1994.",
            "The share of polar bears exposed to some of the pathogens has at least doubled since the 1990s, the new study finds. These germs were the parasite Neospora caninum and the two bacteria behind the diseases brucellosis and tularemia.",
            "More bears in the more recent survey also had antibodies against canine distemper virus. It causes a fatal disease in dogs and certain other mammals. And the share of bears who\u2019d encountered the parasite Toxoplasma gondii increased sevenfold. It went up from about 2 percent to 14 percent.\u00a0Though T. gondii completes its life cycle in the guts of cats, it can infect many animal species.",
            "Rode\u2019s team also compared ratios of chemical markers in the bears\u2019 hair. These markers all related to what the bears eat. Individual bears varied in the prey they ate most. But their specific diets were linked to their pathogen exposure, the new study finds.",
            "\u201c[Polar bears] are probably not the only species that has higher exposure to these pathogens,\u201d Rode says. \u201cIt\u2019s within the food chain that this has increased.\u201d",
            "In recent years, ringed seals have died off in large numbers from an unknown disease, Rode notes. Ringed seals are a key prey of the polar bears. This finding helped alert researchers to look at pathogen levels in polar bears.",
            "Andy Dobson is a wildlife disease ecologist at Princeton University in New Jersey. He says the findings are interesting. But they are inconclusive, he adds. That\u2019s because the samples were taken from two different areas within the domain of this bear population.",
            "Still, the movement of pathogens likely affects the whole food chain \u2014 even humans. People eat some polar bears as part of a subsistence diet, Rode notes. More work is needed to know if there\u2019s now an increased risk of these germs infecting people."

Similarly, if you live in a cold climate, you may have seen the trucks that salt and sand the streets after a snowfall to prevent ice from building up on the roads. In both of these instances, salt is acting to lower the\u00a0freezing point\u00a0of water and changing what\u00a0phase of matter\u00a0the water is (i.e., turning solid ice into liquid water).",
            "For the ice cream maker, because the rock salt lowers the freezing point of the ice, the temperature of the ice/rock salt mixture can drop below the normal freezing point of water. This makes it possible to freeze the ice cream mixture in the inner container of the ice cream machine. For the salt spread on streets in wintertime, the lowered freezing point means that snow and ice can melt even when the weather is below the normal freezing point of water. Both the ice cream maker and road salt are examples of\u00a0freezing point depression.",

In a\u00a0solution, there is a\u00a0solvent\u00a0(the water in this example) and a\u00a0solute\u00a0(the salt in this example). A\u00a0molecule\u00a0of the solute dissolves (goes into solution) because the force of attraction between the solute molecule and the solvent molecules is greater than the force of attraction between the molecules of the solute. Water (H2O) is a good solvent because it is partially\u00a0polarized. (This polarization is caused by the distribution of\u00a0electrons\u00a0in the water molecule. Specifically, its hydrogen ends have a partial\u00a0positive charge, and the oxygen end has a partial\u00a0negative charge.)",

That raises the question: Are human structures playing some role in fostering thundersnow?",

            "The climbing air will rise several kilometers (miles) up, to a height where the temperature is below freezing. This can trigger a phenomenon called triboelectrification (Try-bo-ee-lek-trih-fih-KAY-shun). This word describes friction among air particles that causes a separation of electrical charge. It\u2019s somewhat like rubbing a balloon against fabric so that the separated charge now allows the balloon to temporarily \u201cstick\u201d to the wall.",
            "Air within the thunderstorm is very turbulent. This causes ice crystals to bump into each other. Through this process, they can gain or lose electrons. Ice crystals lose electrons, leaving them positively charged. Wetter precipitation gains electrons, making it negatively charged. When the charges build up enough \u2014 ZAP! An electric spark,\u00a0or lightning,\u00a0jumps between the two regions to balance out the charge.",
            "*350_inline-summerstormgif",
            "fCIn a normal thunderstorm, lightning can reach down from clouds having a low base. Strong temperature differentials between the stormy area and the region in front of the storm, can cause air to rise quickly, creating lots of friction and charge separation.",
            "To get this in the wintertime, however, is challenging. In the summer, pockets of air rise vertically to produce thunderstorms. That doesn\u2019t really happen in the winter. Frigid-weather storms develop differently.",
            "Two conflicting forces wage a battle that sends air on a \u201cslantwise\u201d path high into the sky. That means the air isn\u2019t rising straight up and down, as in most thunderstorms. Thundersnow storms also do not usually form on the warm side of large, spiraling cyclones, as thunderstorms typically do. Instead, they develop in a weird spot \u2013 the colder backside of the storm system.",
            "Because large storm systems oftentimes look like commas, that aggressive backlash is called the \u201ccomma head.\u201d This is where cold air wraps in from the north.",
            "Snowstorms can become super windy. This will happen because the lowest air pressure will occur at the center of the storm. It mimics a vacuum, pulling in air from its surroundings. Air spirals into the middle of storm systems like water swirling down a drain.",
            "Or this is what usually happens.",
            "But the January 2018 storm threw a meteorological curveball. It brought with it an extremely strong temperature gradient. Over the ocean waters off of Cape Cod, Mass., air temperatures soared to near 13\u00b0 Celsius (55.4\u00b0 Fahrenheit). Just 330 kilometers (205 miles) to the west, over land in Connecticut, it was 18 degrees C (23 degrees F) colder.",
            "That extreme temperature contrast over such a narrow region generated a thermal wind. That\u2019s when air flows from warm to cold regions.",
            "Since cold air is denser; it sinks to the ground. Warm air from the ocean gets pulled in to replace it. That surface-hugging cold air undercuts the encroaching warm air. So the warm air now sloshes up that cold \u201csurface\u201d of air.",
            "That warm air goes on to climb into the atmosphere because it has so much momentum. It\u2019s like rolling a ball up a slide. Here, the slide is the surface of cold air. And the warm air is that ball rolling up that surface. Normally, the air wouldn\u2019t take this path. It\u2019s like bowling the ball up the slide, against the force of gravity.\u00a0",
            "It\u2019s also fairly uncommon, which makes it tough to forecast. It is much easier to predict the conditions that tend to be associated with it, such as narrow bands of heavy snow.",
            "Figuring out if, when and where lightning will strike within a snowstorm is a different story.",
            "The National Lightning Detection Network is a commercial array of antennas across the United States. It monitors lightning strikes 24/7, all year long. But this network\u2019s antennas will miss bolts that flash within clouds. That\u2019s why the National Weather Service relies on public reports of thunder or lightning to track most thundersnow.",
            "On rare occasions, as occurred earlier this winter, bolts may strike the ground. And when they do, these can be just as dangerous as strikes during a summer storm. They can cause damage, injury \u2014 even death. One bolt during a snowstorm on February 9, 2017, caused a house fire in Warwick, R.I. The bolt also zapped a nearby tree, blasting part of its trunk into the wall of that home,",
            "So what\u2019s going on? Two Japanese researchers had some insights 24 years ago that they described in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Their paper reviewed decades\u2019 worth of wintertime lightning strikes off the north coast of Japan. The pair used radar data and measurements from instruments used to measure electrical activity. From these data, clues emerged. It appeared that a key change takes place when low-topped winter thunderclouds mature.",
            "Think of the cloud as a three-layer cake, with each layer having a different electrical charge. For shallow, low-topped winter thunderclouds, the charges in these layers are positive-negative-positive. The lower positive charge can appear at temperatures from 0 to -9\u00b0 Celsius.",
            "And where the lower layer has a net positive electric charge, that layer \u201cis apparently capable of initiating ground flashes,\u201d the paper noted.",
            "So why did the 2018 New England storm clouds almost exclusively throw their lightning at tall towers?",
            "It\u2019s possible that these towers triggered the lightning by poking into the underside of clouds. In doing so, they take on this lower positive charge. They can now spark a bolt between the now-positive tower and the negative charge in the middle of the cloud above.",
            "But that alone shouldn\u2019t be enough to generate a bolt. After all, the electric fields in snowstorms are significantly smaller than those in summer thunderclouds.",
            "However, those fields can be locally enhanced by pointy objects. Those points can focus a charge, boosting it 10-fold. And that may be enough to exceed the level required for an electric charge \u2014 or spark \u2014 to leap\u00a0through the air. Once this happens, that spark can set off a rapid chain reaction.",
            "With that, a lightning bolt is born.",
            "But there\u2019s a catch. Nature resists charges leaping through the air. So when a charge builds up on some object, the air tends to create a local region around it that has the opposite electric charge. This is known as a \u201cspace charge.\u201d",
            "Consider the tower. If a positive charge were to build up on the tip, a negative space charge should form around it. This would shield the tower tip from being struck by a bolt from a region in the middle layer of the cloud .",
            "However, where the winds are strong enough, they can actually blow away this shielding space charge. That would leave the tower tip exposed, dramatically upping the odds of it triggering a lightning strike.",
            "This was observed in 2011 during the Chicago thundersnow storm of February 1 and 2. Researchers Tom Warner, Timothy Lang and Walter Lyons observed winds of 29 kilometers per hour (18 miles per hour) during each cloud-to-ground lightning flash. They noted a whopping 93 percent of lightning strikes in the snowy region of the storm involved tall buildings or towers (including wind turbines).",
            "During New England\u2019s January thundersnow events, the top of each tower where a lightning bolt was recorded had also\u00a0experienced high winds. Indeed, the minimum speed during every single flash exceeded 36 kilometers per hour (22.4 miles per hour). Moreover, the base of these storm clouds had been extremely low.",
            "The minimum height at which moisture will condense, forming a cloud, is known as the \u201clifting condensation level.\u201d In the case of the January storms, that level was around 275 meters (902 feet). And guess what: Each tower struck by lightning had been higher than that. So they would have poked into that lower positively charged region of the clouds.",
            "There was an exception, however. It was off the coast of Block Island, Rhode Island.",
            "At first glance, it looked like 10 or so bolts of lightning had randomly struck the water. Data would later show that five wind turbines were out there. The turbines\u2019 blades were mounted atop 30-meter (98.5-foot) pedestals. The turbines\u2019 shafts were each 100 meters (328 feet) tall. And each turbine blade was 73.5 meters (214 feet) long. Their total height, then, would exceed 200 meters (656 feet) when a blade tip was pointed up.",
            "That\u2019s still, however, 75 meters (246 feet) short of the seemingly minimum height needed to pierce the cloud bottoms. But that doesn\u2019t have to violate the rule because when clouds move over the ocean, they will encounter air with additional water vapor. And that will allow the minimum cloud-bottom height to fall somewhat. That means the blade tips indeed could have been immersed in the clouds\u2019 lower positive charge.",
            "Knowing this, can meteorologists forecast thundersnow in advance?",
            "It appears so.",
            "They can scan for conditions that would make possible such electrical light shows. For instance, something known as \u201cice crystal canting\u201d often precedes winter lightning strikes. This term refers to the orientation of snowflakes. Those flakes and other ice crystals normally fall flatly horizontal, like a pancake on a griddle. But as an electric field builds in the base of a cloud, it can tilt (or cant) ice crystals into a vertical (up and down) orientation.",
            "This shows up on radar as confused-looking banding. Knowing how to spot that radar signature could give forecasters a heads up to a field strong enough to produce thundersnow.",
            "Figuring out which towers are tall enough to scrape the cloud base also\u00a0 could pinpoint likely strike candidates.",
            "It\u2019s entirely possible that without skyscrapers and other super-tall human-constructed towers, most thundersnow simply wouldn\u2019t happen.",
            "Using such knowledge, it might be possible one day soon to calculate the risk in a storm that any given tall structure will be struck by winter lightning.",

            "In winter, the air up there can be very cold \u2014 and will get chillier the higher you go. To form snowflakes, those clouds need to be below freezing. But not too cold. Snowflakes form from the moisture in a cloud. If the air gets too cold, a cloud won\u2019t hold enough water for anything to precipitate out. So there has to be a balance. That\u2019s why most flakes develop at or just below freezing \u2014 0\u00ba Celsius (32\u00ba Fahrenheit). Snow can form in cooler environments, but the colder it gets, the less moisture will be available to make a snowflake.",
            "In fact, a cloud\u2019s air has to be supersaturated with moisture for a flake to form. That means there is more water in the air than would normally be possible. (The relative humidity can reach 101 percent during supersaturation. That means there is 1 percent more water in the air than it should be able to hold.)",
            "When there is too much liquid water in the air, a cloud will try to rid itself of the excess. Some of that excess can flash freeze into crystals, which then lazily meander to the ground.",
            "Or that\u2019s the simple answer. The details aren\u2019t quite that straightforward.",
            "One more thing is needed to turn cloud moisture into a flake. Scientists call it a nucleus (NOO-klee-uhs). Without something to glom onto, water droplets can\u2019t freeze. Even when the air temperature is well below freezing, water droplets will remain liquid \u2014 at least until they have a solid object onto which they can attach.",
            "Usually, that will be something like a pollen grain, dust particle or some other airborne bit. It could be smoglike aerosols or the volatile organic compounds released by plants. Even tiny soot particles or microscopic metal bits spewed in a car\u2019s exhaust could become the nuclei around which snowflakes crystalize.",

Different from frost, rime ice develops when supercooled water droplets freeze onto subfreezing surfaces. (In contrast, frost forms when moisture collects on surfaces in liquid form, and then freezes.)\u00a0",
            "High in a cloud, there have to be some tiny floating particles for snow crystals to develop. When the right conditions do emerge, supercooled drops of water will latch onto these nuclei (NOO-klee-eye). They do it one by one, building an ice crystal.",

            "The oxygen\u2019s nucleus is larger, so it has more pull. It yanks more strongly at the negatively charged electrons that they share. This brings those electrons a little closer. It also gives the oxygen a relative negative electric charge. The two hydrogen atoms end up a tad positive, in terms of charge.",
            "Alone, the structure of a water molecule resembles a wide V. But when multiple H2O molecules find themselves close to one another, they begin to pivot so that their electrical charges pair up. Opposite charges attract. So a negative hydrogen aims itself towards a positive oxygen. The shape that tends to result: a hexagon.",
            "That\u2019s why snowflakes have six sides. It stems from the hexagonal \u2014 six-sided \u2014 structure of most ice crystals. And hexagons team up. They link with other hexagons, growing outward.",

As that was back before portable home cameras, this number can be challenged. But snowflakes larger than 15.2 centimeters (6 inches) do sometimes develop. Biggies tend to form when temps are near freezing and the air humid. A snowflake\u2019s size also reflects other factors.

            "Globular springtails jump so fast that they can appear to vanish, Smith says. This may be a useful skill for evading predators.",

            "Smith paired up with biomechanist Jacob Harrison to learn how these animals do their acrobatic moves. Harrison works at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. The team analyzed high-speed footage of more than a dozen springtails as they flipped and spun.",
            "Each launch begins with a thump. The springtail releases a fork-shaped body part called the furca (or furcula) from its underbelly. Like a spring, that furca propels the arthropod up and into a backward spin.",
            "Globular springtails fly through the air as fast as 1.5 meters per second, on average, the new data show. And the number of spins per leap is equally impressive \u2014 anywhere between 14 and 29.",
            "These flights don\u2019t always have a pretty ending. Springtails sometimes crash land and tumble to a stop. But most times, these backflippers nail the landing, the team found. They do this by using a sticky tube normally used for grooming. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of anchor that pulls them to their feet so they can get on with their day,\u201d Smith explains.\u00a0",
            "Smith hopes the team\u2019s findings inspire more studies like theirs. \u201cWe sometimes get told that the only exciting parts of nature are fossilized in the ground or hidden in a tropical rainforest,\u201d he says. Ordinary creatures like the springtails are pulling off incredible feats all around us, he believes. Even in our backyards. We just have to look."

They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",

            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",

            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",

It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",

Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",

            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

If you measure the properties of one particle, you automatically know the properties of the other. And whatever happens to one will also affect the other.",

This would suggest that information can travel infinitely fast. And nothing, not even information, is supposed to be able to travel faster than the speed of light.

            "Yes, mayonnaise, the same stuff you might put on a sandwich. Dollops of the condiment could help scientists better design nuclear fusion experiments.",
            "Mayonnaise is useful for smearing on sandwiches and\u00a0 prepping potato salads. But scientists are now using it to study nuclear fusion.",
            "How mayonnaise behaves can vary. If jiggled gently, it returns to its original shape. That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",
            "But it\u2019s difficult to study how materials behave under the extreme conditions required for fusion. And that\u2019s where the mayonnaise comes in.",
            "The behavior of the fuel capsule in fusion experiments, it turns out, has a lot in common with mayonnaise. The fuel capsule is a metal or other material that contains a gas (the fuel). When lasers hit the capsule, it melts. The melty capsule can now switch from elastic to plastic.",
            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Two mechanical engineers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., wanted to understand that better. So they looked at how mayo mixes with a gas \u2014 air. Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",
            "The scientists observed the glob while the wheel was spinning. They looked at it again after it stopped. They checked whether the mayo had returned to its original form, changed shape or broken apart. This determined the border between its elastic and plastic behaviors, they explain in the May Physical Review E.",
            "Working with mayo does have one drawback. When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"

            "Tiny as they are, paper cuts can cause real pain.",
            "It\u2019s common to get a minor cut while flipping through a magazine or book. But tissue paper is not likely to draw blood. Now, scientists have explained the physics behind why some paper is more likely to slice through skin.",
            "Physicist Kaare Jensen was part of a team that set up experiments to study this. They used a gelatin replica of human tissue. Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",
            "The most treacherous paper tested was the kind used in old-fashioned dot matrix printers. Good news for fingers everywhere: That paper isn\u2019t used much anymore. Magazine paper ranked a close second in the scientists\u2019 tests.",
            "The slicing angle also mattered. Pressing the paper\u2019s edge straight down into the gelatin was less likely to cause a cut than if the paper\u2019s path angled across and down.",
            "Next, the researchers put paper\u2019s slicing powers to use. They designed a 3-D printed tool they call the Papermachete. Loaded with a strip of printer paper, the tool becomes a single-use knife. The paper blade can cut into cucumber, pepper and apple. It can even cut chicken. The tool could be a low-cost option for prepping some foods.",
            "Next, the researchers plan to study more realistic, finger-shaped materials, rather than flat sheets of gelatin, says Jensen.",
            "No human fingers were harmed in the making of the study. \u201cIdeally, you would want some test subjects,\u201d Jensen says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to find volunteers.\u201d"

            "Dandruff makes the scalp itch, but it\u2019s not a dry skin problem. Treating it may call for a change in how often you wash your hair, use of an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo, or even turning to a prescription shampoo. ",
            "Dandruff flakes on your hair or shoulders don\u2019t look good. The itchy scalp that comes with it is no fun, either. In fact, although dandruff shows up on your hair, the condition actually starts with your scalp.",
            "Dandruff is a type of dermatitis (Der-muh-TY-tis), or skin inflammation. One study estimated that half of us will at some point develop this condition. And one key time it may emerge is puberty.",
            "Everyone\u2019s scalp hosts a mix of microbes. This is known as its microbiome (MY-kroh-BY-ohm). Sometimes the normal proportion of some types to others gets messed up. This is known as a dysbiosis (Dis-by-OH-sis). In people with dandruff, certain types of yeast and bacteria are far more common, compared to people with healthy scalps.",
            "Amy McMichael\u00a0and others discussed some of the culprits in a July 2024 report in the Archives of Dermatological Research. She\u2019s a dermatologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Both are in Winston-Salem, N.C.",
            "People often make the mistake of thinking an itchy, scaly scalp is dry, McMichael says. If they add oil, though, they risk making matters worse. Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",
            "Hair-care practices might explain some of the difference, McMichael says. She and others have found differences in how often women of African and European ancestry shampoo their hair. Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",
            "And also use hair conditioners, McMichael advises. \u201cIt actually smooths the outer layer \u2014 the cuticle \u2014 much better than you can get with oil.\u201d Be careful about using hair sprays and gels, she adds. These can dry hair, increasing the risk that strands will break.",
            "In any case, if you notice a hair or scalp problem, talk to your doctor or another health-care expert right away. You might need help for dandruff. Or you might have a more serious skin or hair condition.",

            "The heart beats steadily from long before you\u2019re born to the day you die. Triggering each beat (illustrated in background by an electrocardiogram line) is a zap of electricity \u2014 literally the pulse of life. ",
            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GMBSU-2GK3E?feature=oembed",
            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",

That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."
