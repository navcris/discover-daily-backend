            "Scientists have found a new strategy they hope will someday reduce plastic pollution in waterways, which threatens our health and the environment.",
            "Our planet is awash in plastic pollution. Tiny bits of it, called microplastics, taint the air and our food. Plastic specks have been found everywhere from our bodies to a dolphin\u2019s breath. That\u2019s why scientists keep looking for ways to break down this sturdy material. Now, they\u2019ve discovered a promising new strategy.",
            "Bacteria common in wastewater can break down a common type of plastic called PET. That finding could inform new ways to clean up PET pollution, which may make up around half of all the microplastic in wastewater.",
            "The microbes in question are Comamonas. Scientists have long known these bacteria grow on plastics in water. That got Ludmilla Aristilde wondering if the microbes use plastic as food. Aristilde is an environmental biochemist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Her team decided to investigate if Comamonas bacteria eat PET.",

            "PET is short for polyethylene terephthalate\u00a0(Pahl-ee-ETH-eh-leen TEHR-eh-THAAL-ayt). This is the world\u2019s most widely used plastic. Some 56 million tons of it is made each year \u2014 mostly for polyester clothing, water and soda bottles, and the packaging of many store-bought goods. That leads to a lot of PET pollution.",
            "Lint-size pieces of PET come out of polyester clothes when they\u2019re washed \u2014 and flow through water treatment plants into waterways. Bits of PET also get into waterways as plastic bottles and other PET packaging break down in the environment.",
            "In past work, Aristilde discovered that one strain of Comamonas\u00a0could break apart rings of carbon atoms in laundry detergent. Those carbon rings, she notes, were similar to the ones found in plastics. Here was a clue that the microbes, Comamonas testosterone, may be able to break down PET as well.",
            "Since microplastics and bacteria are both tiny, it can be hard to tell what the microbes are doing to PET. To find out, Aristilde\u2019s team grew C. testosteroni in the lab. Then they placed the microbes in a liquid-filled container for a month with either tiny pellets or thin, flat strips of PET.",
            "Afterward, they looked at the surface of the plastic with a scanning electron microscope. This type of microscope can create very detailed images of surfaces.",

The image on the right shows that same piece of plastic after Comamonas bacteria fed on it for a month. In that time, the microbes degraded the plastic by breaking off nano-sized pieces of it from the surface.",
            "The team found that the plastic pellets were breaking apart. Nanoparticles of PET now floated in the water. At the end of the month, more than three times as many nano bits were in the water as before. This showed that the bacteria had been breaking apart the PET. The bacteria also multiplied faster when they had PET available. That suggests they were using carbon molecules from the plastic bits as food.\u00a0",
            "The researchers wanted to know what chemical reaction the microbes used to break apart the plastic\u2019s carbon molecules. So they beamed a laser onto the molecules. It showed how the molecules\u2019 bonds were broken and that the chemical reaction had involved water. This released PET pieces small enough for the microbes to gobble up.",
            "Aristilde\u2019s team then looked at a genetic map of C. testosteroni. They found that the microbe had 39 genes for making enzymes that might be involved in degrading PET. These were enzymes that could use water to break bonds. The researchers then went back to observe which of those enzymes were present in the PET-bacteria soup. Just one had been made inside the microbes living with PET.",

            "\u201cThat was quite surprising,\u201d says Aristilde. She had expected to find multiple enzymes at play.",
            "Her group set out to prove this one enzyme was breaking apart the plastic. Colleagues from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee tweaked C. testosteroni microbes. The changes removed the gene that allowed the bacteria to produce this enzyme. Without this gene, the microbes could no longer munch apart the plastic.",
            "As one further test, Oak Ridge researchers inserted that enzyme-making gene into a different bacterium. It was a type of microbe that didn\u2019t normally eat plastic. But once it was able to make the same enzyme as C. testosteroni, that microbe could eat PET, too.",
            "The researchers shared these findings October 29 in Environmental Science and Technology.",
            "Ren Wei is skeptical about harnessing the microbes\u2019 ability to clean up PET pollution. A biochemist, he works with plastic-degrading enzymes at the University of Greifswald in Germany.",
            "The tiny organisms eat super tiny amounts of plastic. The rate at which they chow down on PET, Wei says, is far too slow to remove much of the vast amounts that enter the environment each year.",
            "Jay Mellies sees things differently. The new finding excites this microbiologist at Reed College in Portland, Ore. He, too, works with plastic-degrading microbes.",
            "\u201cThe plastic problem on our planet is enormous, and every good idea should be pursued,\u201d he says. Even though scientists have known for decades about other microbes that degrade plastics, none do it fast enough. Learning about a common wastewater bacterium that can eat plastics in water is an idea worth pursuing. The challenge now, Mellies says, is finding a practical use for the new knowledge. \u00a0",
            "Victor Gambarini agrees. A microbiologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, he works on plastic-degrading microbes as well. Finding this plastic-degrading enzyme is an important first step, he says. Now, teams will need to hunt for similar enzymes \u2014 perhaps in other microbes \u2014 that work faster. Or they might try to modify an enzyme in the lab to work better. This is something Aristilde\u2019s team is already thinking about.",
            "Wei points out that breaking down plastics with microbes should be considered an emergency technique and not a main solution. Let\u2019s focus first on using less plastic, he says, and making it more reusable.",

            "Veggies pack lots of nutrients. But our bodies need some nutrients that can be found only in animal products, such as meat and milk. Now, researchers have tweaked the genes in leaves so that plants, too, can at last make some of these compounds. This might one day let vegetarians and vegans rely on plants for the full range of nutrients their bodies need.",
            "\u201cMy mom is a vegetarian,\u201d says Pengxiang Fan. \u201cSo I started looking at what I can do to improve the plant-based diet.\u201d A biochemist, Fan works at Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China.",
            "Enzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions inside living things. To pump out the animal-type nutrients, plant leaves need enzymes they don\u2019t normally have. In this case, they need enzymes that help turn certain amino acids \u2014 the building blocks of proteins \u2014 into compounds normally found only in meat.",
            "Fan is part of a team that put genetic instructions for making these animal-based enzymes into a bacterium: Agrobacterium tumefaciens. This microbe can then transfer genes to plants.",
            "The team prepared multiple sets of genetic instructions. The sets differ in which amino acids and nutrients they can make. By combining the sets in different ways \u2014 like combining Lego blocks to build different structures \u2014 the instructions would allow plants to make different nutrients. The researchers then injected bacteria carrying these instructions into the leaves on a relative of the tobacco plant.",
            "*blue_gloved_hands_holding_a_tobacco_plant_and_injecting_it_with_a_clear_fluid",
            "fCResearchers injected bacteria into leaves of this relative of a tobacco plant. Those microbes provided the plant with new genetic instructions \u2014 ones needed to make nutrients normally found only in animals.",
            "The treated leaves then made two animal-type nutrients. One was creatine. It\u2019s a molecule formed from three amino acids. The other, carnosine, is made from two amino acids. In both people and animals, creatine helps bring energy to muscles. Carnosine is an antioxidant. It also helps stave off muscle fatigue.",
            "Which nutrient the leaves made depended on which genetic instructions they had received. After four to five days, the researchers harvested leaves from the plants.",
            "People need about 1.7 grams of creatine and 0.6 gram of carnosine each day. The amounts of creatine and carnosine that the plant made are much less than that, Fan notes.",
            "For every gram of plant leaf with animal enzymes, the plant had made 2.3 micrograms of creatine or 69.5 micrograms of carnosine. (A microgram is a millionth of a gram. It\u2019s about one-fiftieth the weight of a grain of salt.) For comparison, a gram of meat contains about 1,000 times as much creatine and about 100 times as much carnosine as a gram of the modified plant.",
            "The team shared its findings in the October 16 Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.",
            "The plants used to test this technique aren\u2019t edible. But one day, Fan hopes to try adding such nutrient-making enzymes to crops such as tomatoes.",
            "But, Fan cautions, before using this technique in fruits or veggies, \u201cwe need to be very careful.\u201d The plant might adapt to the genes in unexpected ways. For example, the team tried to get their test plant to make taurine, another nutrient. This amino acid plays a role in digestion. But the injected genes didn\u2019t work the way the team had hoped. Those enzymes kept the plant from making cysteine. It\u2019s an amino acid the plant needs to make that taurine.",
            "Injecting the genetic instructions into a leaf takes just a few days. That\u2019s a lot faster than the typical approach for testing genetic tweaks to plants, says Laurie Leonelli. She\u2019s a photosynthesis engineer who did not take part in the study. She works at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. For instance, growing whole plants that carry new genetic instructions can take two or three years. So the new bacteria injections certainly save scientists a lot of time in seeing if their approach works, Leonelli says.",
            "Fan plans to try adding genes for making other animal nutrients to plants, too. Ideally, he says, his group could come up with a set of instructions for every amino acid. People get some other nutrients primarily from meat, too \u2014 such as vitamin B12. Fan plans to explore ways to boost plant levels of these nutrients as well.",
            "If plants are grown in a mindful way, they should have fewer impacts on the environment than the farming of animals have, Leonelli says. The new work is \u201ctrying to make plants more nutritious so we don\u2019t have to rely so heavily on animal [products].\u201d",

            "Dying of heartbreak is a trope that often pops up in myth and fantasy. In Star Wars, Padm\u00e9 Amidala may have died of a broken heart after her husband turned to the dark side, becoming Darth Vader.

And it can occur after extreme emotional or physical stress \u2014 making \u201cheartbreak\u201d both real and sometimes deadly.\u00a0",
            "Death by broken heart has been a popular theme in fiction for a long time. Yet doctors only began recording real cases in the 1960s, says Trisha Singh. This heart doctor, or cardiologist, works at University Hospitals Dorset in England.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Medical imaging technology has improved since then. That has allowed doctors to directly study the hearts of afflicted patients.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "What triggers takotsubo syndrome is still something of a mystery.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "One hypothesis is that a traumatic event causes a surge of\u202fstress hormones in the brain and adrenal glands. The left ventricle is loaded with receptors for these chemicals. So a sudden flood of them could cause its taut, elastic muscle to become loose and puffy. That would prevent it from delivering enough blood to the body.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Another hypothesis is that a stress response briefly \u201cstuns\u201d the heart. A third idea is that reduced levels of the hormone estrogen play a role.\u202fThat\u2019s because most cases of takotsubo syndrome are in older women. These women have usually gone through menopause \u2014 a stage of life when they stop menstruating. After menopause, they produce less estrogen than before.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Takotsubo syndrome is fairly rare. It accounts for only about 2 percent of people who seek medical care for an apparent heart attack. Peter Rahko recalls a case from the 1980s. He\u2019s a cardiologist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\u00a0",
            "Rahko remembers an older woman was called to a hospital in rural Wisconsin. There, she was shown the body of her son, who had died in a car accident. \u201cWithin five minutes, she started having severe chest pain [and] collapsed on the floor,\u201d Rahko says.\u202f\u00a0",
            "The woman was flown to Madison, where Rahko treated her. He snaked a catheter into her heart to see if something was blocking the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. That is what usually causes a heart attack. To his surprise, \u201cher arteries were totally normal,\u201d he says. \u201cBut her heart function was dramatically reduced.\u201d In takotsubo syndrome, the heart vessels are often clear. In fact, most patients do not have classic risk factors for heart problems.\u202f\u00a0",
            "Looking back, Rahko realizes his patient had takotsubo. Today, reduced heart function with no clear signs of disease is a tip-off for this condition. A doctor will see if a patient has experienced acute stress. For instance, if they have been grieving a loss.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In some cases, the tragic event that triggers takotsubo syndrome is obvious. But even events with more long-term effects have been tipping points. Examples include\u202fthe COVID-19 pandemic\u202fand\u202fearthquakes in New Zealand. Many patients, Singh notes, also have mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",
            "Though severe, takotsubo is quite short-lived and typically not fatal. About 4 percent of people die of the condition. About 75 percent fully recover after 10 days, as Rahko\u2019s patient did. Many recover after only 48 to 72 hours.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely incredible,\u201d Singh says. She recalls one patient who came in with a severely impaired heart. \u201cI came back and rescanned her six hours later,\u201d Singh says. \u201cAnd it had gone from severely impaired \u2026 to almost normal.\u201d\u202f\u00a0",
            "The standard care for takotsubo is to treat the patient with medicines for heart failure. But since some people recover so quickly, \u201cit raises a question,\u201d Rahko says. \u201cShould we even be bothering with trying to put people on these medications? Are they even going to do any good?\u201d With basic medical support, like fluids and drugs to prevent blood clotting, the heart may unbreak itself.\u202f\u202f\u00a0",

            "It\u2019s official:\u00a0The year 2024 was indeed the hottest on record. It was also the first year in recorded history that Earth\u2019s average temperature was higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial times.",
            "What\u2019s important about that increase? Global leaders had set a goal to keep Earth\u2019s temperature under that 1.5 degree threshold. The reason: Anything above that risks greatly increasing extreme weather events across the planet. These range from heat waves and floods to storms, drought and more. The United Nations had outlined what it might take to stay below that 1.5 degree C increase in a series of reports over the past decade. Chief among changes that people would need to make: reining in use of the fossil fuels. They\u2019re a large source of the world\u2019s increasingly climate-warming greenhouse gas pollution.",
            "Last year smashed through many global records. These included ones for air temperatures, sea-surface temperatures and atmospheric levels of those greenhouse gases. Scientists with the European Union\u2019s Copernicus Climate Change Service outlined a list of those new records in a\u00a0January 10 report.\u00a0",
            "Earth\u2019s global fever in 2024 reached 15.10 \u00b0C (59.18 \u00b0F). That was 0.72 degree C warmer than the planet\u2019s average temperature from 1991 through 2020. Even more important, that was 1.6 degrees C higher than the average from 1850 to 1900. That period was just before the Industrial Revolution. It\u2019s when societies began to turn to fossil fuels as a main source of energy.",

The amped-up temps on land and sea, last year, was higher than ever seen in all the years since record-keeping began.",

By 2050 or so, some billion hectares \u2014 about the land area of the United States \u2014 or more\u00a0could hit temperatures hazardous for human health.\u00a0That\u2019s three times the land area that currently can experience these dangerous heat levels, says Radley Horton. He\u2019s a climate scientist at the Columbia Climate School in New York City.",
            "Earth\u2019s average temperature back around the 1760s was 13.5 \u00b0C (56.3 \u00b0F). When Earth\u2019s average temps reach 2 degrees C (3.6 degree F) above that, huge regions may become so hot and humid that even young, healthy people face extreme danger, Horton says. Where would this be? We\u2019re likely talking about large parts of South Asia and South America, parts of West Africa and some of the U.S. Southeast. These regions won\u2019t be hot all the time. But they could experience extreme heat events at least once every 30 years or so.",
            "As of last year, Earth\u2019s temperature was already 1.6 degrees higher than the preindustrial average. Says Horton: \u201cIt\u2019s sobering to see how close we already are to the brink.\u201d",
            "Last year wasn\u2019t the first time Earth\u2019s temperatures have risen above the 1.5 degree C mark. Pockets of the planet exceeded that benchmark in the last 10 years. And 2023 came awfully close to crossing that line.",

Lava bombs can be mostly round, like basketballs, or elongated, like footballs. Sometimes strings of lava stretch to form ribbon-shaped lava bombs. And lava bombs can get big. The largest one ever recorded was a whopping 6 meters (20 feet) across.",

Smaller lava bombs can cool completely before landing. Larger ones only harden on the outside. This creates a solid coating that cracks like the crust on a loaf of bread. When the inside of a lava bomb is still hot and squishy when it hits the ground, it can land with a splat \u2014 flattening out like a cow pat.",
            "Most lava bombs land within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of an eruption. But some travel as far as 10 kilometers (6 miles). Of all threats posed by a volcanic eruption, researchers estimate, lava bombs are the most dangerous to people.",

This is because many fruits and vegetables, such as apricots, mushrooms, lettuce and pears, turn brown or spoil over time.",

            "This reaction is also called\u00a0enzymatic browning\u00a0and is one of the largest causes of spoilage in fruits and vegetables \u2014 even though it does not make the food harmful to eat. The name enzymatic browning comes from the fact that an enzyme within the fruit turns the fruit brown. But what exactly happens during the enzymatic browning process?",
            "The process occurs when chemicals inside the fruit come into contact with oxygen in the air. This produces\u00a0melanin, the same dark brown pigment that colors human hair, skin and eyes. The\u00a0enzyme\u00a0responsible for the browning is called\u00a0polyphenol oxidase (or PPO). In the presence of\u00a0oxygen, the PPO enzyme changes substances known as phenolic compounds (through a process of\u00a0oxidation) into different compounds called\u00a0quinones. The quinones then react with other compounds to form\u00a0melanin. Melanin is what turns the fruit and vegetables brown.",

            "The enzymatic browning process is only triggered when PPO, phenolic compounds and oxygen come in contact with each other. This is exactly what happens when a fruit is cut, falls or is knocked around too much. When fruit tissue is damaged due to heat, cold, age or mechanical stress, its cells break open and the phenolic compounds and the enzyme are released and mix with oxygen in the air. As a result, the damaged tissue turns brown almost immediately.",
            "In the food industry, lots of attempts have been made to prevent enzymatic browning and keep produce appearing fresh for a long time. One example is the development of the Arctic apple. This apple was modified so that it no longer produces the PPO enzyme. With no enzyme present, the browning reaction cannot occur.",
            "Another solution is to treat the produce in a specific way to inhibit the enzyme, slowing the browning reaction. Enzymes can only work in certain environments. Most cannot function if it gets too cold or too warm, and they do not usually like acidic conditions. In this project, you will apply different liquids to apple slices to see which one works best to keep your apples nice and fresh.",

That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed.

And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",
            "Wait, what\u2019s that behind you? (Boo!)",

            "As a teen, Faria Sana often highlighted books with markers. \u201cThe colors were supposed to tell me different things.\u201d Later, she recalls, \u201cI had no idea what those highlighted texts were supposed to mean.\u201d",
            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",
            "Nate Kornell \u201cdefinitely did cram\u201d before big tests when he was a student. He\u2019s a psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",
            "*a_kid_sitting_at_a_table_studying_and_looking_really_stressed_out",
            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",
            "*a_girl_explaining_something_to_her_mom",
            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",

            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

It also evaluates how science and technology are taught. Donovan\u2019s team looked at six widely used high-school biology textbooks. Nationwide, about two out of every three intro classes in biology use one of these texts.",
            "The researchers scoured each book, looking for passages that dealt with biological sex and gender. In all, they found 362 paragraphs in genetics chapters that dealt with these topics. And in each book, at least some passages erred in how they described sex or gender. The study also turned up problems with how the books taught about traits linked to genes.",

Back in 2019, his team randomly assigned 460 eighth to tenth graders to read one of three genetics passages. The readings differed in how they described what role genes play in differences between sexes. Later, the team surveyed these kids about why they think some people are good at science.",
            "Some of the readings gave an oversimplified version of how genes determine differences between sexes. For example, they described basic genetic differences between men and women based on X- and Y-chromosomes. Students who read these passages were more likely to think that someone\u2019s academic ability was set by genes, too. Such thinking could lead to false beliefs that males and females have different abilities in some fields. This includes success in STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math.",

            "These results are important because gender stereotypes start young. Sexist attitudes about how smart someone is \u2014 including oneself \u2014 can begin by first grade. A limited understanding of biology might support those attitudes. And it could help explain why fewer women seek careers in science and engineering.",
            "The researchers found that the textbooks tended to focus on so-called \u201ceither/or\u201d traits. These are discrete traits that you either have or you don\u2019t. But such traits are actually rare. Some textbooks describe being able to roll your tongue as a discrete trait. It\u2019s not. Some of us can roll our tongues a lot. Others can barely do it. The rest fall somewhere in between.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "Sex and gender are two different things. Textbooks, however, often not only treat them as the same, but also leave out an important variation present in many people: intersexuality. ",
            "Doctors assign sex at birth based on visible genitals. Most people are labeled as female if they have a vulva, or male if they have testes and a penis. But there are also millions of people whose bodies are not strictly male or female. These people are referred to as being intersex. There was no mention of intersex individuals in any of the books reviewed for the new study.",
            "A mixture of genetics and the environment can influence people\u2019s traits. For instance, exposure in utero to some foods and pollutants can mimic sex hormones. That can affect whether people (and animals) develop certain feminine or masculine features.",

            "What does intersex mean? This short video explains how some people are not strictly male or female.",
            "Females usually have two X-chromosomes; males usually have an X- and a Y-chromosome. However, chromosomes and genitals do not set our gender. Gender is different than sex, points out Catherine Riegle-Crumb. She is a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the new study\u2019s authors. A transgender male, for example, might have two X-chromosomes, but his gender is still male.",
            "\u201cGender has to do with our beliefs and ideas about males and females,\u201d explains Riegle-Crumb. We inherit gender from our culture. What is considered normal behavior and preferences for males, females or nonbinary people varies between cultures. It also can change over time.",
            "These expectations \u2014 called gender norms \u2014 affect how society treats people. And it starts even before a baby is born. (Think \u201cgender reveal\u201d parties: pink for females, blue for males.)",
            "Yet in the new study, none of the 362 paragraphs on such topics described the difference between sex and gender. And if students don\u2019t learn the difference, Riegle-Crumb worries, they may assume gender differences are due to sex. It can also make it harder for students to accept transgender people, whose gender doesn\u2019t match the sex they were assigned at birth.",
            "Assumptions could lead students to use genes to explain other differences they see, too. For example, social differences. Why aren\u2019t there more women leaders? The answer is not found in their genes. Still, students may think it is.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The studied books also left out the many ways men and women are similar, Riegle-Crumb notes. Nor did they describe the normal range of differences between people within a group. For example, some men have more feminine features. Some women have more masculine ones.",
            "The books focused instead on the traits women tend to share with women, or men with men.\u00a0 This gives the impression that all women are kind of the same (and so are men).",
            "These books explained differences between people largely on the basis of genes. They gave gene-based reasons 12 times as often as external-factor reasons. External factors include what society expects of us or how our genes may interact with the environment. In fact, genes alone don\u2019t explain most differences between people, Donovan\u2019s team points out.",
            "Nowhere did the books write that genders have different STEM abilities. But kids can come to that false conclusion, Donovan says. It\u2019s something his team saw in its 2019 study.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/kT0HJkr1jj4?feature=oembed",
            "This video explains, using science, why it\u2019s not only outdated but also wrong to think there are just two human sexes.",
            "The new study\u2019s findings are important \u2014 but not surprising, says Zach Schudson. He\u2019s a social psychologist at California State University in Sacramento. He did not take part in the new work. But he does study how beliefs about gender and our bodies can affect how we view ourselves and others.",
            "Says Schudson, the first time most of his students hear about intersex people is in a college class. The new study, he says, helps explain why. Not recognizing that many people won\u2019t fit squarely into a male or female category can lead to prejudice against those who seem different from norms, he says.",
            "These beliefs also can affect someone\u2019s views on gender equality. One 2018 study, for instance, showed that people who believe men and women have distinct capabilities based on their genes were less likely to support equal pay for women. People with such beliefs also may question whether women should be leaders, says Riegle-Crumb.",
            "One way to combat unscientific messaging is call it out, says Riegle-Crumb. People naturally exhibit a diverse range of traits. Don\u2019t try to fit everyone into a few simple boxes. Instead, she suggests, notice both the many traits people share and the ways we differ."

            "Vampire bats live on a strictly blood-based diet. So strict, in fact, that they seem to process their food more like some blood-feeding flies than like other known mammals.",
            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",
            "Researchers shared these findings November 6 in\u00a0Biology Letters.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/rjBtx8AMR_Q?start=3&feature=oembed",
            "Researchers put vampire bats through their paces on a mini treadmill to discover what fuels their metabolism.",
            "The discovery means the vampire bats power along much like blood-feeding tsetse flies or some mosquitoes. That\u2019s a first for mammals, thinks Ken Welch. He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often."

            "Partial avulsions change the land differently. In a partial avulsion, the river splits. For example, a single river channel may split into several. If these channels reconnect downstream, this could create a braided river pattern, with several channels weaving together. Over time, this creates many small islands throughout the river.",

This 3-million-acre (12,000 square kilometers) area of coastal Louisiana stretches into the Gulf of Mexico. (If Louisiana looks like a foot, consider the delta the toe.) As the Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico, it deposits sand and mud.",

As freezing water expands underground, it presses against nearby soil, and pressure builds. The pressure eventually becomes so great that it causes the frozen soil to crack, allowing one section to slide past another. This sliding is similar to what happens during an earthquake. But earthquakes begin deep underground, and frost quakes occur close to the surface.",

They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",

            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",

            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",

            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",

One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",

Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",

But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
