            "A full moon could make it easy for a werewolf to spot prey. But a bright night makes it easy to be spotted, too. ",
            "As the full moon rises, a mythical werewolf howls and heads out on the hunt. But is this the best time for werewolves to find a meal? In some stories, this transformation can happen at any time of the month or even during the day. And science suggests that a careful werewolf might want to schedule their change based on their goals.\u00a0",
            "The moon affects our world in several ways. As it orbits Earth, the moon pushes and pulls at the oceans to make tides. These tides can, in turn, influence the behavior of ocean creatures. And moonlight \u2014 a reflection of the sun \u2014 can also have power over the behavior of animals both on land and in the sea.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "If a werewolf is all big, scary predator, the full moon might be a blessing. But if the animal could face predators itself, it might want to save its transformation for a much darker night.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The dark depths of an ocean or stream might not seem like the obvious place for animals affected by the moon. But \u201cit is something that we see pretty commonly among aquatic critters,\u201d says Heidi Ballew. She\u2019s a marine ecologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ballew studies the \u2018O\u2018opu nakea (Awaous stamineus), a goby native to Hawaii. The hardy little fish are born in freshwater streams in the hills. From there, a goby\u2019s life can take two very different paths depending on when it\u2019s born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When the moon is full, the sun, Earth and moon are lined up. This produces higher tides. Some gobies hatch during that full moon. The higher tides sweep their tiny bodies out to sea. When they are grown, higher tides during the new moon (when the sun, moon and Earth line up again) help them find their way back to their home streams. Special fins on their bellies, modified into suckers, help them climb waterfalls back to their birthplace. There, they mate and make more gobies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/mmwM7dwtvKA?feature=oembed",
            "Waterfall? Not a problem. Watch a goby climb up a waterfall with her mouth and her sucker-like fin.\u00a0",
            "But not all gobies go out to see the world. Gobies born during the dark of a new moon stay home and never leave the stream where they are born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Baby gobies are trying to avoid predation, Ballew says. \u201cA full moon provides a high tide. But it also produces a lot of light \u2014 even underwater.\u201d Night-hunting fish can better see tiny, defenseless gobies. So if a fish is going to stay put, hatching at the new moon is a safer bet.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The moon matters even as they grow into adults. A big, well-fed baby goby may become an adult during the full moon. But a smaller goby might become an adult at the new moon instead. The darkness hides these still-small, newly adult gobies, keeping them safe from predators. Ballew and her colleagues published their fishy findings February 26 in the journal Ecology of Freshwater Fish.\u00a0",
            "So there are pros and cons to lots of moonlight. A full moon lights up the night and makes it easy to spot dinner. But if a werewolf is as likely to become prey as it is to go hunting, a new moon might help it hide.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The bright night of a full moon also presents Australian mammals with a problem, says Euan Ritchie. He\u2019s a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "In one study, Ritchie and his colleagues took photos of animals in southeastern Australia at different phases of the moon. Prey species such as possums and rabbit-sized bandicoots were more active when nights were cloudy. The extra darkness provided cover to hide from predators.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But predators such as quolls were also more active when it was darker \u2014 when the moon was new or half. Each species was trying to find a balance between getting more food and becoming someone else\u2019s dinner.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "*A_spotted-tail_quoll_stands_on_a_rock_covered_in_green_moss_It_has_brown_fur_with_white_dots_all_ove",
            "fCDon\u2019t be fooled, this adorable creature is a fearsome predator. The spotted-tail quoll is more active when the moon is new or half \u2014 when it\u2019s easier to pounce on prey.  ",
            "\u201cPredators often use ambush to capture their prey,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cThe lighter it is, the harder it might be [for predators] to avoid detection.\u201d While the prey might be able to spot a predator more easily, they, too, may be more detectable. \u201cThey [might] be more hesitant to be active, especially in areas without much cover to retreat to.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ritchie and his colleagues published their findings in 2020 in the journal Australian Mammalogy.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Werewolves also need to find that balance between predator and prey. If a werewolf wanted to hunt as much as possible, \u201cthey would hunt humans by day and night,\u201d Ritchie says. But being a werewolf isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cMany prey, including humans, are often far from harmless.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In that case, Ballew says, a werewolf might be advised to vary its strategy. A big, strong werewolf could find good hunting during the full moon. But if a werewolf is small, young, or weak? \u201cMaybe you would want to utilize the new moon so that your predators are less likely to find you.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson a werewolf could learn from the gobies that stayed home.\u00a0\u00a0"

            "Insects are an eco-friendly source of protein, but many people find the idea of eating them gross. By extracting their protein to make supplements, such as powders, manufacturers could camouflage their use in many cooked and baked foods. ",
            "Mealworms for lunch? Ewww! For many of us, that would be our first reaction to finding these beetle larvae on today\u2019s menu. But if we\u2019re not so quick to \u201cick,\u201d the protein from these insects has a lot to offer, say some researchers. That\u2019s what\u2019s behind new work to see how insect protein might be used to fortify many types of foods.",
            "Edible insects are a healthy and sustainable source of animal protein. That\u2019s why food scientists have been working to extract it \u2014 then turn it into a powder. That means diners don\u2019t have to bite into any heads, legs or wormy bodies. But some extraction methods can degrade certain health benefits of that protein.",
            "The new work seeks to prevent that. If it succeeds, it could open up new prospects for insect-based foods.\u00a0",
            "We need protein in our diets. That can come from sources such as beans, tofu, eggs or meat. Meat is high in protein. But some insect proteins may be healthier for us than the meat of larger animals, such as beef, fish or chicken. Farming insects is also better for the planet than other types of livestock. It uses less land, water and energy. And it produces fewer greenhouse gases, such as methane.",
            "Overall, \u201cinsects have shown great potential,\u201d says Yookyung Kim. She\u2019s a food scientist at Korea University in Seoul. Kim values insects\u2019 high protein content.",
            "But there\u2019s more. Many edible insects are full of vitamins and minerals. They also contain other compounds, such as amino acids and peptides, that can promote good health. In fact, some of these compounds are being studied to treat ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Extracting them from insects might lead to new health supplements.\u00a0",
            "To get there, science will have to pass a few hurdles. First is chitin (KY-tehn). It makes up the crunchy exoskeleton on many arthropods, from insects and arachnids to shellfish. Insect larvae contain some chitin, too. This sugar-based polymer binds to proteins and makes them hard to digest. So diners who eat whole insects won\u2019t get full nutritional benefit from their proteins.",
            "Treatment can separate out that chitin. Now, people can better absorb the protein.",
            "But there\u2019s still the yuck factor. Eating insects is normal in some parts of the world. Many of us don\u2019t want to eat insects, however \u2014 no matter how nutritious they may be. And it\u2019s hard to ignore that you\u2019re eating insects if you crunch on their legs or wings. That\u2019s a big reason why Kim focuses on turning the beneficial parts into a powder.",
            "Plus, she adds, powders are practical. They tend to last longer than whole insects and are easier to ship.",
            "But techniques to remove proteins can have their own problems, Kim\u2019s team has found. Most take a lot of time, money and energy. This can make it hard for a small farmer to turn insects into powder.\u00a0",
            "Kim\u2019s team decided to see if simpler, less costly methods worked. And they applied them to mealworms.",
            "Despite their name, mealworms are larvae of the darkling beetle. Kim\u2019s team tried four ways to turn proteins from these beetle larvae into powder. Then they tested how nutritional each powder was.",
            "Three techniques started by drying the larvae, then grinding them in a blender. Next, the researchers soaked the ground worms in ethanol, a type of alcohol, to break up the fats. Then, they mixed in one of three solutions to dissolve the proteins out of the defatted worms. One solution was sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Another contained a salt. The third contained enzymes. Lastly, they freeze-dried the mix to remove water. The leftover material was crushed into a powder.",
            "The fourth method was simpler. The team froze and then thawed the mealworms. Afterward, they ran the larvae through a screw press, which squished their tissue. This squeezed out any liquids. It\u2019s similar to how olive oil is extracted from whole olives. Next, the team strained the liquid and freeze-dried it (to remove water). They powdered what was left.",
            "*a_set_of_images_showing_the_steps_of_extracting_protein_from_frozen_mealworms_Frozen,_thawing,_screw",
            "fCResearchers tested four different ways to extract protein from mealworms. The simplest was the screw-press, which squeezes nutrient-rich liquid out of the larvae. Other methods used alcohol to remove fats, then separated out the proteins using alkali, salt or enzymes.  ",
            "The team analyzed how much protein, fat, amino acids and chitin were in each of these four powders.",
            "Each powder had different advantages.",
            "Powder from the screw-press technique, for instance, kept less protein but more of the fatty lipids. (Many lipids are healthful compounds that can help fight some diseases.) Other methods preserved more protein but lost some other nutrients.",
            "So different methods \u2014 or a mix of them \u2014 might be chosen to preserve more of certain target ingredients.",
            "The team shared its findings August 21 in the Journal of Food Science.",
            "Catriona Lakemond is a food scientist at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. She, too, works on insect proteins for human diners. And she finds the new data interesting. People are more likely to accept eating a powder rather than a whole insect, she says. Plus, she adds, extraction allows for the protein to find a wider range of uses.",
            "Still, there remain challenges to getting these insect powders onto dinner plates, Lakemond says.",
            "It\u2019s not yet easy to find this protein \u2014 or foods made with it \u2014 at the grocery store. Lakemond wants it to be easier for farmers to grow, process and sell edible insects. And more people will need to be ready to buy foods made with insect ingredients.",
            "Food allergies are another factor, says food scientist Andrea Liceaga. People with shellfish allergies, she notes, may also be allergic to insects.",
            "Liceaga works with insect proteins at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. Her past work has shown that how protein is extracted can affect how likely it is to trigger an allergic reaction. So it will be critical to test insect-based products for allergens, she says.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/avutyyRSh4w?feature=oembed",
            "Eating mealworms is not just an idea. Some companies are already rearing enough of the beetle larvae to provide food companies with commercial quantities of their protein. See how it\u2019s done on an industrial scale and hear about the broad range of uses they imagine for this ingredient.",
            "All these food scientists imagine us one day eating more insects. Which type and how they\u2019re prepared will probably depend on people\u2019s culture, says Liceaga. But at some point, insects will become just another ingredient.",
            "And what seems gross today might soon become desirable. By way of example, she points to lobster. Today it\u2019s a pricy delicacy. But in colonial America, it was an unpopular \u201cpoor-man\u2019s food.\u201d",
            "No matter how healthy or planet-friendly insects may be, Lakemond says, one thing is key for people to eat them. \u201cWe need to make really good products with a good taste.\u201d"

            "The ER-2 plane soared over storms in the Caribbean and Central America in July 2023. It cruised at an altitude of about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles).

            "And then there are the newfound flickering gamma-ray flashes. These outbursts fall between the two other types of gamma-ray emissions in both brightness and duration. Like high-energy strobe lights, gamma-ray flickers consist of short pulses that repeat over tens to hundreds of milliseconds. \u00d8stgaard and the other researchers described these on October 3 in yet another Nature paper.",
            "Those flickers could help solve a couple key mysteries about thunderstorms. One is: How are their different types of gamma-ray outbursts related?",
            "Storms are known to produce gamma rays when electrons get accelerated in\u00a0strong electric fields\u00a0that build up inside clouds. These electrons produce more electrons, and so on. When electrons in this avalanche smash into air molecules, they throw off gamma rays. But it\u2019s still unknown what makes a cloud emit a terrestrial gamma-ray flash, versus a gamma-ray glow.",

The Piranha Plants of the Mario Bros. video games hope to make a snack out of our favorite plumber. And in \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bThe Addams Family, Morticia owns an \u201cAfrican Strangler\u201d plant with a pesky habit of biting humans.\u00a0\u00a0",

Humans aren\u2019t on the menu for the 800 or so carnivorous plants found worldwide. But what would it take for a carnivorous plant to capture and consume a person?\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Carnivorous plants come in many shapes and sizes. One common type is the pitcher plant. These plants lure prey into their tube-shaped leaves using sweet nectar. \u201cYou could get a really tall, deep pitcher that would be effective as a pitfall trap for larger animals,\u201d says Kadeem Gilbert. This botanist studies tropical pitcher plants at Michigan State University in Hickory Corners.\u00a0",
            "The lips of these \u201cpitchers\u201d have a slippery coating. Insects (and sometimes small mammals) that lose their footing on this coating plunge into a pool of digestive enzymes. Those enzymes break the animal\u2019s tissue down into nutrients that the pitcher plant absorbs.\u00a0",
            "Pitcher plants aren\u2019t equipped to make regular meals out of mammals, though. While larger species can trap rodents and tree shrews, pitcher plants mainly eat insects and other arthropods, says Gilbert. And the few pitcher plant species large enough to snare mammals are probably after these animals\u2019 poo rather than their bodies. The plants catch poop left by small mammals as they lap up the plant\u2019s nectar. Consuming this predigested material would use less energy than digesting the animal itself, Gilbert says.\u00a0",
            "A man-eating plant would want to save energy when it could. \u201cThe depictions in Mario Brothers and Little Shop of Horrors seem less realistic,\u201d says Gilbert.

            "Both of those fictional plants take cues from the real-life Venus flytrap. Instead of sporting a pitcher, a flytrap relies on jaw-like leaves to catch prey. When an insect lands on these leaves, it triggers tiny hairs that prompt the leaves to snap shut. Triggering these hairs produces electrical signals that use up valuable energy, Gilbert says. More energy is then needed to produce enough enzymes to digest the plant\u2019s prey. A giant flytrap would need massive amounts of energy to move electrical signals across its hefty leaves and also produce enough enzymes to digest a human.\u00a0",

            "\u200b\u200bBarry Rice agrees that the ideal man-eating plant wouldn\u2019t move. He studies carnivorous plants at the University of California, Davis. All plants have cells lined with a rigid cell wall, Rice notes. This helps give them structure but makes them \u201cterrible at bending and moving around,\u201d he says. Real carnivorous plants with snap-traps are small enough that their cellular structure doesn\u2019t limit any moving parts. But a plant large enough to catch a person? \u201cYou\u2019d have to make it a pitfall trap,\u201d he says.\u00a0",
            "The \u200b\u200bSarlaccs of the Star Wars universe offer a good example of how man-eating plants might work, Rice says. These fictional beasts bury themselves in the sands of the planet Tatooine. They lie motionless, waiting for prey to fall into their gaping mouths. A massive pitcher plant growing at ground level would essentially become a huge, living pit. A careless human that falls in could then be slowly digested by powerful acids.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Digesting a human may be more trouble than it\u2019s worth, though. The extra nutrients from undigested prey would promote the growth of bacteria. If the plant takes too long to digest a meal, the corpse could begin to rot inside the plant, Rice says. Those bacteria could end up infecting the plant and causing it to rot, too. \u201cThe plant\u2019s got to be able to make sure it can take those nutrients out of there,\u201d says Rice. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019re gonna get a compost pile.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Pitcher plants and snap-traps, though, may offer humans too many chances to wriggle free. Large mammals could escape by simply thrashing about, says Adam Cross. He\u2019s a restoration ecologist at Curtin University in Bentley, Australia, and has studied meat-eating plants. A person trapped in a pitcher plant could easily punch a hole through its leaves \u200b\u200bto drain the fluid and escape, he says.

            "The glue-like traps of sundews, however, would prevent a person from fighting back. These carnivorous plants use leaves covered in tiny hairs and sticky secretions to capture insects. The best human-trapping plant would be a massive sundew that carpets the ground with long, tentacle-like leaves, Cross says. Each leaf would be covered in big globs of a thick, sticky substance. \u201cThe more you struggled, the more you would become enmeshed and the more your arms would be unable to function properly,\u201d says Cross. The sundew would subdue a person through exhaustion.\u200b\u200b\u00a0",
            "Sundews\u2019 sweet scents may entice insects, but that\u2019s probably not enough to lure humans into a trap. Animals are rarely attracted to plants unless the critters are looking for a place to sleep, something to forage for or another resource that can\u2019t be found elsewhere, Cross says. And for a human, the reward of going near a man-eating sundew would need to be worth the risk. \u200b\u200bCross recommends a fleshy, nutritious fruit or a \u200b\u200breliable source of water. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way to do it,\u201d says Cross. \u201cBring them in with something tasty, and then munch on them yourself.\u201d\u00a0",

I went to a local haunted attraction and had a light bulb moment. I had spent all my time thinking about fear as this negative thing. Yet here I was lining up to spend money and my time to be scared.

I\u2019ll then take that and change it into something that can be used for a really fun scare. For example, I researched how our senses process so much without our awareness. I used those findings to develop jumpscares, like things tickling your ankles or strobing lights.\u00a0",
            "A lot of haunted attractions think that they just have to continue to make their attractions scarier by adding more blood and violence. But research shows that we find new and unusual experiences more engaging, fun and scary. Thinking about the importance of where a haunt is and who lives there is important. Visitors attending an attraction in the city might find the smells of the country pretty unfamiliar. So the smell of hay or fertilizer is going to be unexpected and add a layer of excitement. A great haunted attraction doesn\u2019t have to be all about violence.\u00a0",

It\u2019s fulfilling to know that the kids who read this can feel more okay about what they enjoy. That liking scary things is normal and doesn\u2019t make a person bad. I enjoy helping people understand why they might like some things and not others. I want people to find that investigating their fears can [be] helpful rather than an obstacle in their lives.\u00a0\u00a0",

I also do a lot of hiking and outdoor activities. I\u2019m trying to push myself. I understand now why it\u2019s important to keep pushing our boundaries as we age. We tend to do fewer things because we\u2019re afraid of dying or hurting our own aging bodies. That can limit our lives, and I don\u2019t want that to happen. So I try and do things that are a little scary as I age. Of course, I\u2019m all about decorating, dressing up and going out to local haunted attractions when it\u2019s Halloween season.\u00a0",

            "I had a very traditional career path before I started researching fear. I was working at the \u200b\u200bVeterans Affairs Healthcare System on research projects. At first, I liked the work. But I started to realize that staying in that position would mean doing the same thing every day. It was not an environment where I was going to thrive.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "I asked myself if it would be worth it to be miserable all the time just for job security and the pay. Sometimes in life, it isn\u2019t a question of whether it is worth it but if it is necessary. It\u2019s about having what you need to support yourself and your family. I was privileged enough to say it was not worth my mental health. I am fine living on a very limited income if it means that I can do something where I feel fulfilled every day.\u00a0"

New research unveils the skull bones of these tiny beasts and how their noggins may help them burrow through the ground.",
            "Despite their ambiguous common name and wriggly nature, these lizards are not worms. And \u201cworm-lizard\u201d sounds less like a spelling bee word than \u201camphisbaenian\u201d (Am-fis-BEE-nee-un). That\u2019s the formal name for these generally limbless reptiles.",

Lewis turned these images over to Antonio Meza, who was part of this work while at Sam Houston State University.

He works at North Carolina State University in Raleigh and was not involved in the new study. In addition to the big central canine, the CT scans revealed a bone that is barely visible, he notes. It sits at the bottom of the skull. Researchers have no idea why the bone is there, Hartstone-Rose says.",

Many are interlocked, like hands whose fingers are intertwined. The sutures\u2019 patterns may relate to how the animals move their heads. Worm-lizards dig in a variety of ways, he says. Some move their heads up and down and others side to side.",
            "To need such unusual sutures, these animals \u201cmust be doing something powerful with their skull,\u201d Lewis says. He thinks the sutures help keep the worm-lizards\u2019 skulls from breaking when they burrow through tough soil.",
            "The team\u2019s new findings appear in the March issue of The Anatomical Record.",
            "So far, Meza has investigated seven of the eight Zygaspis species. Many anatomical studies only examine one specimen from one genus, says Meza, who is now at Arizona State University in Tempe. From one sample, studies may attempt to draw conclusions about a whole class of animals. But even among different species from the same genus, Meza has found many unique features. This work shows the need to study multiple specimens in the same genus, he says.",
            "Rather than studying more bones, Lewis first wants to learn more about the animals\u2019 muscles, nerves and brain \u2014 their soft tissues \u2014 in their heads. Then, he\u2019d like to study how soft tissues and the bones work together.",
            "Hartstone-Rose, in contrast, is more interested in how these animals\u2019 bones develop. He\u2019s particularly curious about the premaxilla, the bone that holds the large central tooth. In most animals, there is a left and a right one, he notes. \u00a0But in amphisbaenians, there is just one middle bone. Studying the skulls of baby amphisbaenians could reveal differences that set these creatures apart from others.",
            "These two new papers \u201cdo a beautiful job of describing magnificent biology,\u201d Hartstone-Rose says. But they\u2019re only the beginning, he adds. For worm-lizards, there are still more questions than answers."

            "The unicorns in the new movie Onward may look like the beauties that adorn fanciful clothing and school supplies. But don\u2019t be fooled by their silvery white color and shimmery horns. These gussied-up ponies act like dumpster-diving raccoons while snarling at residents. They roam the streets of Mushroomton, a town populated by magical creatures.",
            "The unicorns popular today typically aren\u2019t garbage-eating pests. But they often have a similar look: white horses with heads that have sprouted a single spiraling horn. While everyone knows that these unicorns are just a flight of fancy, is there any chance they could ever exist?",
            "The short answer: It\u2019s highly unlikely. But scientists have ideas about how these animals could become real. A bigger question, though, is whether it would be a good idea to make one.",
            "A unicorn doesn\u2019t look that much different from a white horse. And getting a white horse is pretty easy. One mutation on a single gene turns an animal into an albino. These animals don\u2019t make the pigment melanin. Albino horses have white bodies and manes and light eyes. But this mutation can also mess with other processes inside the body. In some animals, it can lead to poor vision or even blindness. So unicorns that evolved from albino horses might not be all that healthy.\u00a0",
            "*albino_horse",
            "fCMaybe unicorns could evolve from albino horses. These animals lack the pigment melanin. That leaves them with white bodies and light eyes. ",
            "A horn or rainbow coloring are more complex traits. They tend to involve more than one gene. \u201cWe can\u2019t say \u2018we are going to change this gene and now we\u2019re going to have a horn,\u2019\u201d says Alisa Vershinina. She studies the DNA of ancient horses at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\u00a0",
            "If any of these traits were to evolve, they would need to give a unicorn some advantage that helps it survive or reproduce. A horn, for instance, might help a unicorn defend itself against predators. Colorful features might help a male unicorn attract a mate. That\u2019s why many birds have bright and bold colors. \u201cMaybe horses would be able develop these crazy colors \u2026 that would favor boys that are very beautiful pink and purple,\u201d Vershinina says.",
            "But none of this would happen fast because horses (and the resulting unicorns) have relatively long lifespans and reproduce slowly. Evolution \u201cdoesn\u2019t work in a snap,\u201d Vershinina notes.\u00a0",
            "Insects generally have short generation times, so they can evolve body parts quickly. Some beetles have horns that they use for defense. A beetle might be able to evolve such a horn in 20 years, Vershinina says. But even if it were possible for a horse to evolve into a unicorn, that \u201cwould take more than a hundred years, probably, if not a thousand,\u201d she says.\u00a0",
            "Perhaps instead of waiting for evolution to make a unicorn, people could engineer them. Scientists might use the tools of bioengineering to cobble together the traits of a unicorn from other creatures.\u00a0",
            "Paul Knoepfler is a biologist and stem-cell researcher at the University of California, Davis. He and his daughter Julie wrote a book, How to Build a Dragon or Die Trying. In it, they ponder how modern techniques could be used to build mythical creatures, including unicorns. To transform a horse into a unicorn, you could try adding a horn from a related animal, Paul Knoepfler says.\u00a0",
            "*narwhal",
            "fCA narwhal\u2019s tusk looks like a unicorn horn, but it\u2019s actually a tooth that grows in a long straight spiral. It grows through a narwhal\u2019s upper lip. That might make it tricky to successfully put one on a horse\u2019s head, says Paul Knoepfler. It\u2019s not clear how a horse could grow something similar, he says. If it could, it might get infected or damage the animal\u2019s brain.",
            "One approach would be to use CRISPR. This gene-editing tool lets scientists tweak an organism\u2019s DNA. Researchers have found certain genes that are turned off or on when animals are growing their horns. So in a horse, \u201cyou might be able to \u2026 add a few different genes that would result in a horn sprouting on their head,\u201d he says.",
            "It would take some work to figure out which genes are the best to edit, Knoepfler notes. And then there are challenges to making the horn grow properly. Also, CRISPR itself isn\u2019t perfect. If CRISPR creates the wrong mutation, this could give the horse an unwanted trait. Maybe \u201cinstead of the horn off the top of its head, there\u2019s a tail growing there,\u201d he says. A change that drastic, though, would be pretty unlikely.\u00a0",
            "A different approach would be to create an animal that contains DNA from several species. You might start with a horse embryo, Knoepfler says. As it develops, \u201cyou might be able to transplant some tissue from an antelope or some animal that naturally has a horn.\u201d But there\u2019s a risk that the horse\u2019s immune system might reject the other animal\u2019s tissue.\u00a0",
            "With all these methods, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of things that could go wrong,\u201d Knoepfler notes. Still, he says, making a unicorn seems almost realistic compared with creating a dragon. And for any approach, you\u2019d need a team of researchers, plus veterinarians and reproductive experts. Such a project would take years, he notes.\u00a0",
            "If scientists succeed in giving a horse a horn, it might not be good for the animal. Vershinina questions whether a horse\u2019s body could support a long horn. A horn might make it harder for a horse to eat. Horses haven\u2019t evolved to deal with a horn\u2019s weight as some other animals have. \u201cRhinos have this awesome horn on their head. But they also have a massive head and they can eat with it,\u201d she notes. \u201cThis is because this horn evolved as a part of the body.\u201d",
            "There are many other potential problems. Lab-grown unicorns would never have existed as part of an ecosystem. If they entered the wild, we have no clue what would happen and how they would interact with other species, Knoepfler says.\u00a0",
            "*rainbow_unicorn",
            "fCCartoon unicorns sometimes sport vivid rainbow manes. \u201cTo have something like a rainbow, it\u2019s got to take tons of genes interacting in a very interesting way,\u201d Alisa Vershinina says.",
            "Also, huge ethical questions surround the possibility of modifying animals or creating something like a new species. The purpose for creating these unicorns would matter, argues Knoepfler. \u201cWe\u2019d want these new creatures to have happy lives and not suffer,\u201d he says. That might not happen if they were being bred like circus animals just to make money.",
            "Vershinina has considered the ethics of trying to recreate creatures, such as mammoths, that don\u2019t exist anymore. One question that would apply to unicorns and mammoths alike is how such an animal might survive in an environment to which it\u2019s not adapted. \u201cAre we going to be solely responsible for keeping it alive and feeding it?\u201d she asks. Is it OK to make just one, or does a unicorn need others of its kind? And what happens if the process isn\u2019t successful \u2014 will those creatures suffer? Ultimately, \u201cwho are we on this planet to play this role?\u201d she asks.\u00a0",
            "And what if unicorns aren\u2019t the sparkly, happy creatures of our fantasies? \u201cWhat if we did all this work and we have these beautiful perfect unicorns with rainbow manes and these perfect horns, but they\u2019re very grumpy?\u201d Knoepfler asks. They could be destructive, he says. They might even turn out to pests, like the ones in Onward.",
            "The earliest description of something like a unicorn comes from the fifth century B.C., says Adrienne Mayor. She\u2019s a historian of ancient science. She works at Stanford University in California. The description is found in the writings of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. He wrote about the animals of Africa.\u00a0",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that [his unicorn] would have been a rhinoceros. But in ancient Greece, they would have had no idea what it actually looked like,\u201d Mayor says. Herodotus\u2019 description was based on hearsay, travelers\u2019 tales and a heavy dose of folklore, she says.",
            "The image of a horned white horse comes later, from Europe in the Middle Ages. That\u2019s from about 500 to 1500 A.D. Back then, Europeans didn\u2019t know about rhinos. Instead, they had this \u201cenchanting image of a pure white unicorn,\u201d Mayor says. In this period, unicorns were also a symbol in religion. They represented purity. \u00a0",
            "At that time, people believed unicorn horns had magical and medicinal qualities, Mayor notes. Shops that sold medicinal compounds would sell unicorn horns. Those \u201cunicorn horns\u201d were actually narwhal tusks collected at sea.\u00a0",

            "The worm that doctors found in the woman\u2019s brain was far from its usual home. These parasites typically shuttle between snakes and small mammals. Adult worms tend to live inside carpet pythons (Morelia spilota). These snakes then shed worm eggs in their feces. Rats or possums, for example, can ingest the eggs. Once the eggs grow into larvae, these worms will burrow into the mammals\u2019 flesh. Pythons then eat the infected animals, and the cycle continues.",

            "Consider Toxocara. These worms infect cats and dogs. When those animals poop in backyards, sandboxes or public parks, the worms\u2019 eggs end up where children play. \u201cThis is why veterinarians encourage deworming,\u201d she says.",
            "If the dirty sand gets in a kid\u2019s mouth, larvae can hatch a child\u2019s body, much as it would in a dog or cat. But in people, the larvae won\u2019t end up in the gut and grow into adults. Instead, they\u2019ll get stuck in other tissues.",
            "Like O. robertsi worms, Toxocara larvae can inflame internal organs. Doctors have reported cases where the worms wandered up to someone\u2019s eye. \u201cEven though we are accidental hosts,\u201d Weatherhead says, the parasite \u201ccan still cause significant disease in humans.\u201d",
            "Roundworms rarely burrow into human brains. But they can infect other body parts. One study estimated that about 1 in 20 people in the United States have been exposed to Toxocara.",
            "The true number is hard to pinpoint. Weatherhead was part of a team that looked at Toxocara cases at a children\u2019s hospital in Texas. Kids living in low-income areas were more likely to be infected, they found. That was especially true where stray dogs and cats roam. Their research was published August 23 in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal.",

            "A\u00a0mummy, like the one shown in Figure 1 below, is a corpse whose skin and flesh have been preserved by chemicals or by exposure to the elements of weather. The ancient Egyptians believed that preserving the body was important because without the body, the previous owner\u2019s \u201cka,\u201d or life force, would always be hungry. It was important for a person\u2019s ka to survive so that he or she could enjoy the afterlife, or life after death. The ancient Egyptians started mummifying remains about 3500 B.C., although older purposefully mummified remains have been found elsewhere, such as in Pakistan about 5000 B.C. and in Chile around 5050 B.C.",
            "There were several steps to the Egyptian ritual of\u00a0mummification. First, the body was thoroughly washed in the waters of the Nile River. Then the brain was removed through the nostrils and discarded. An opening was made in the left side of the abdomen and the lungs, liver, stomach and intestines were removed and placed into four\u00a0canopic jars. Each jar was believed to be guarded by a different god. The heart was left in the body because the ancient Egyptians believed that the heart was the location of emotion and thought.",

A\u00a0desiccant\u00a0is a substance that dries out things next to it. It does this by absorbing water or moisture from its surrounding environment. As you probably guessed, the purpose of stuffing and covering the body with natron was to remove all bodily fluids from the body and\u00a0desiccate\u00a0it.",

Once completely wrapped, the remains were placed inside of a\u00a0sarcophagus\u00a0and then inside of a tomb. In the case of the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure, their tombs are now known as the Great Pyramids of Giza.",

            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply.

            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",

            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",

The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",

First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",

She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth\u2019s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.",
            "Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",
            "Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth\u2019s inner structure. They\u2019ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists \u2014 \u00a0including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago \u2014 have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth\u2019s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.",

            "This solid metal ball has a radius of 1,220 kilometers (758 miles), or about three-quarters that of the moon. It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",
            "At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth\u2019s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

            "Earth\u2019s crust is like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. It is extremely thin, cold\u00a0and brittle compared to what lies below it. The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",

He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",

            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",

In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",

            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",

            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",

            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

            "\u201cWe\u2019re not able to say that this is a sign of life,\u201d says Katie Stack Morgan. \u201cBut this is the most compelling sample we\u2019ve found yet.\u201d Morgan is the deputy project scientist in charge of the Mars rover. She works at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.",
            "Nicknamed Percy, the rover turned up this potential sign of life in mid-July. The robot had drilled into a reddish rock at a site known as Cheyava Falls. (It was named for a feature at the Grand Canyon.) This is the first piece of Mars that Percy found containing organic molecules. Here, the term organic refers to carbon-based molecules. On Earth, they\u2019re the building blocks of life.",
            "Project scientist Ken Farley shared Percy\u2019s discovery July 25 at the\u00a010th International Conference on Mars\u00a0in Pasadena. Farley works at the California Institute of Technology there.",
            "This isn\u2019t the first sign of organics on Mars. The\u00a0Curiosity rover detected organic molecules\u00a0in 2014. It had been examining rocks at a site called Gale Crater. But since Percy\u00a0landed in Jezero Crater three years ago, scientists have struggled to identify organics, Stack Morgan says. That landing site was an ancient, dried-up lake.",
            "Adding to the new excitement, little white spots with black rims speckle the reddish rock sample that Percy found. \u201cThey look like a tricolored leopard spot,\u201d Stack Morgan says.",
            "Percy examined these spots using instruments that can identify the chemical recipe of materials. And the spots\u2019 rims contained iron phosphate. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry have been linked to ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create such rings can be an energy source for microbes.",
            "To exist, those rings \u201cdon\u2019t\u00a0require\u00a0life,\u201d Stack Morgan says. And that\u2019s an important point. \u201cBut based on our experience with similar things on Earth,\u201d she says, \u201cthere is a possibility that life could have been involved.\u201d So, Stack Morgan concludes, \u201cthese could have a biological origin.\u201d",
            "But other features of the sampled rock seem to muddy the picture of how it likely formed. For instance, Stack Morgan notes, it\u2019s shot through with white veins of calcium sulfate. And those veins are filled with super-tiny crystals of olivine. It\u2019s a mineral that forms from a volcano\u2019s magma.",
            "Finding the spots and these volcanic features in the same rock is \u201ca little bit mysterious,\u201d Stack Morgan says. They seem to point to different origins, she says. Going forward, figuring out how the rock formed could help tell how likely it is to have had the right conditions and temperatures to have once hosted life.",

            "\u201cCould this truly be a [signature of life]?\u201d he asks. \u201cYes. And if it is, then it really is the kind of society-altering discovery that the discovery of truly extraterrestrial life would be.\u201d But it\u2019s also possible, he notes, that the spots came from something other than life. In that case, he notes, \u201cAll this is, is an interesting example of water-rock chemistry.\u201d",
            "The only way to find out for sure is to bring the rock home. A big part of Percy\u2019s mission is to collect samples from interesting rocks for a future spacecraft to later bring home to Earth. Once here, they can be studied with better tools than a rover can carry on its back. For now, Stack Morgan says, Percy has thrown everything it has at this rock.",
            "When might the rocks be brought to Earth? No one knows. Funding is currently on hold for a program known as Mars Sample Return, or MSR. \u201cWith this sample, the rationale for MSR is strengthened,\u201d Byrne says. He hopes it will \u201cmotivate NASA to commit to \u2026 this project sooner rather than later.\u201d",

            "*Student_thinking",
            "IQ plays a role in how successful we become. But working on projects close to the heart and knuckling down to see them through may be more important.",
            "Earlier this year, 11-year-old Kashmea Wahi of London, England scored 162 on an IQ test. That\u2019s a perfect score. The results were published by Mensa, a group for highly intelligent people. Wahi is the youngest person ever to get a perfect score on that particular test.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Does her high score mean she will go on to do great things \u2014 like Stephen Hawking or Albert Einstein, two of the world\u2019s greatest scientists? Maybe. But maybe not.",
            "IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person\u2019s reasoning ability. In short, it is supposed to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to answer questions or make predictions. IQ tests begin to assess this by measuring short- and long-term memory. They also measure how well people can solve puzzles and recall information they\u2019ve heard \u2014 and how quickly.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_man_and_a_boy_playing_chess",
            "fCChess is a game of skill and strategy.  Intelligence helps, but so does really caring about it and having the perseverence to slowly build skills in it.",
            "Every student can learn, no matter how intelligent. But some students struggle in school because of a weakness in one specific area of intelligence. These students often benefit from special education programs. There, they get extra help in the areas where they\u2019re struggling. IQ tests can help teachers figure out which students would benefit from such extra help.",
            "IQ tests also can help identify students who would do well in fast-paced \u201cgifted education\u201d programs. Many colleges and universities also use exams similar to IQ tests to select students. And the U.S. government \u2014 including its military \u2014 uses IQ tests when choosing who to hire. These tests help predict which people would make good leaders, or be better at certain\u00a0specific skills.",
            "It\u2019s tempting to read a lot into someone\u2019s IQ score. Most non-experts think intelligence is the reason successful people do so well. Psychologists who study intelligence find this is only partly true. IQ tests can predict how well people will do in particular situations, such as thinking abstractly in science, engineering or art. Or leading teams of people. But there\u2019s more to the story. Extraordinary achievement depends on many things. And those extra categories include ambition, persistence, opportunity, the ability to think clearly \u2014 even luck.",
            "Intelligence matters. But not as much as you might think.",
            "IQ tests have been around for more than a century. They were originally created in France to help identify students who needed extra help in school.",
            "The U.S. government later used modified versions of these tests during World War I. Leaders in the armed forces knew that letting unqualified people into battle could be dangerous. So they used the tests to help find qualified candidates. The military continues to do that today. The Armed Forces Qualification Test is one of many different IQ tests in use.",
            "IQ tests have many different purposes, notes Joel Schneider. He is a psychologist at Illinois State University in Normal. Some IQ tests have been designed to assess children at specific ages. Some are for adults. And some have been designed for people with particular disabilities.",
            "But any of these tests will tend to work well only for people who share a similar cultural or social upbringing. \u201cIn the United States,\u201d for instance, \u201ca person who has no idea who George Washington was probably has lower-than-average intelligence,\u201d Schneider says. \u201cIn Japan, not knowing who Washington was reveals very little about the person\u2019s intelligence.\u201d",
            "Questions about important historical figures fall into the \u201cknowledge\u201d category of IQ tests. Knowledge-based questions test what a person knows about the world. For example, they might ask whether people know why it\u2019s important to wash their hands before they eat.",
            "*3_sets_of_shapes_designed_to_test_pattern_recognition_",
            "fCReasoning questions like this one ask test-takers to figure out what would come next in the pattern.",
            "IQ tests also ask harder questions to measure someone\u2019s knowledge. What is abstract art? What does it mean to default on a loan? What is the difference between weather and climate? These types of questions test whether someone knows about things that are valued in their culture, Schneider explains.",
            "Such knowledge-based questions measure what scientists call crystallized intelligence. But some categories of IQ tests don\u2019t deal with knowledge at all.",
            "Some deal with memory. Others measure what\u2019s called fluid intelligence. That\u2019s a person\u2019s ability to use logic and reason to solve a problem. For example, test-takers might have to figure out what a shape would look like if it were rotated. Fluid intelligence is behind \u201caha\u201d moments \u2014 times when you suddenly connect the dots to see the bigger picture.",
            "Aki Nikolaidis is a neuroscientist, someone who studies structures in the brain. He works at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And he wanted to know what parts of the brain are active during those \u201caha\u201d episodes.",
            "In a study published earlier this year, he and his team studied 71 adults. The researchers tested the volunteers\u2019 fluid intelligence with a standard IQ test that had been designed for adults. At the same time, they mapped out which areas of test takers\u2019 brains were working hardest. They did this using a brain scan called magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or MRS. It uses magnets to hunt for particular molecules of interest in the brain.",
            "As brain cells work, they gobble up glucose, a simple sugar, and spit out the leftovers. MRS scans let researchers spy those leftovers. That told them which specific areas of people\u2019s brains were working hard and breaking down more glucose.",
            "People who scored higher on fluid intelligence tended to have more glucose leftovers in certain parts of their brains. These areas are on the left side of the brain and toward the front. They\u2019re involved with planning movements, with spatial visualization and with reasoning. All are key aspects of problem solving.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand how intelligence is related to brain structure and function,\u201d says Nikolaidis. That, he adds, could help scientists develop better ways to boost fluid intelligence.",
            "IQ tests \u201cmeasure a set of skills that are important to society,\u201d notes Scott Barry Kaufman. He\u2019s a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. But, he adds, such tests don\u2019t tell the full story about someone\u2019s potential. One reason: IQ tests favor people who can think on the spot. It\u2019s a skill plenty of capable people lack.",
            "It\u2019s also something Kaufman appreciates\u00a0as well as anyone.",

            "fCDaydreaming may seem like a waste of time, but research by Scott Barry Kaufman suggests that it\u2019s actually an important part of creative problem-solving.",
            "As a boy, he needed extra time to process the words he heard. That slowed his learning. His school put him into special education classes, where he stayed until high school. Eventually, an observant teacher suggested he might do well in regular classes. He made the switch and, with hard work, indeed did well.",
            "Kaufman now studies what he calls \u201cpersonal intelligence.\u201d It\u2019s how people\u2019s interests and natural abilities combine to help them work toward their goals. IQ is one such ability. Self-control is another. Both help people focus their attention when they need to, such as at school.",
            "Psychologists lump together a person\u2019s focused attention, self-control and problem-solving into a skill they call executive function. The brain cells behind executive function are known as the executive control network. This network turns on\u00a0when someone is taking an IQ test. Many of the same brain areas are involved in fluid intelligence.",
            "But personal intelligence is more than just executive function. It\u2019s tied to personal goals. If people are working toward some goal, they\u2019ll be interested and focused on what they are doing. They might daydream about a project even while not actively working on it. Although daydreaming may seem like a waste of time to outsiders, it can have major benefits for the person doing it.",
            "When engaged in some task, such as learning, people want to keep at it, Kaufman explains. That means they will push forward, long after they might otherwise have been expected to give up. Engagement also lets a person switch between focused attention and mind wandering.",
            "That daydreaming state can be an important part of intelligence. It is often while the mind is \u201cwandering\u201d that sudden insights or hunches emerge about how something works.",
            "*a_composite_image_showing_brain_activity_during_a_creative_thinking_task",
            "fCPeople doing a creative thinking task use two different brain networks at the same time, suggesting that creativity is a unique state of mind.",
            "While daydreaming, a so-called default mode network within the brain kicks into action. Its nerve cells are active when the brain is at rest. For a long time, psychologists thought the default mode network was active only when the executive control network rested. In other words, you could not focus on an activity and daydream at the same time.",
            "To see if that was really true, last year Kaufman teamed up with researchers at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro and at the University of Graz in Austria. They scanned the brains of volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI. This tool uses a strong magnetic field to record brain activity.",
            "As they scanned the brains of 25 college students, the researchers asked the students to think of as many creative uses as they could for everyday objects. And as students were being as creative as possible, parts of both the default mode network and the executive control network lit up. The two systems weren\u2019t at odds with each other. Rather, Kaufman suspects, the two networks work together to make creativity possible.",
            "\u201cCreativity seems to be a unique state of consciousness,\u201d Kaufman now says. And he thinks it is essential for problem-solving.",
            "Just being intelligent doesn\u2019t mean someone will be successful. And just because someone is less intelligent doesn\u2019t mean that person will fail. That\u2019s one take-home message from the work of people like Angela Duckworth.",
            "*a_girl_sitting_at_a_table_with_a_pile_of_books_in_front_of_her",
            "fCScientists find that students with more grit study harder than their peers and earn higher grades.",
            "She works at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Like many other psychologists, Duckworth wondered what makes one person more successful than another. In 2007, she interviewed people from all walks of life. She asked each what they thought made someone successful. Most people believed intelligence and talent were important. But smart people don\u2019t always live up to their potential.",
            "When Duckworth dug deeper, she found that the people who performed best \u2014 those who were promoted over and over, or made a lot of money \u2014 shared a trait independent of intelligence. They had what she now calls grit. Grit has two parts: passion and perseverance. Passion points to a lasting interest in something. People who persevere work through\u00a0challenges to finish a project.",
            "Duckworth developed a set of questions to assess passion and perseverance. She calls it her \u201cgrit scale.\u201d",
            "In one study of people 25 and older, she found that as people age, they become more likely to stick with a project. She also found that grit increases with education. People who had finished college scored higher on the grit scale than did people who quit before graduation. People who went to graduate school after college scored even higher.",
            "She then did another study with college students. Duckworth wanted to see how intelligence and grit affected performance in school. So she compared scores on college-entrance exams (like the SAT), which estimate IQ, to school grades and someone\u2019s score on the grit scale. Students with higher grades tended to have more grit. That\u2019s not surprising. Getting good grades takes both smarts and hard work. But Duckworth also found that intelligence and grit don\u2019t always go hand in hand. On average, students with higher exam scores tended to be less gritty than those who scored lower.",
            "*a_girl_competing_in_a_spelling_bee_standing_on_stage",
            "fCStudents who perform best in the National Spelling Bee are those with grit. Their passion, drive, and persistance pay off and help them succeed against less \u201cgritty\u201d competitors.",
            "But some people counter that this grit may not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Among those people is Marcus Cred\u00e9. He\u2019s a psychologist at Iowa State University in Ames. He recently pooled the results of 88 studies on grit. Together, those studies involved nearly 67,000 people. And grit did not predict success, Cred\u00e9 found.",
            "However, he thinks grit is very similar to conscientiousness. That someone\u2019s ability to set goals, work toward them and think things through before acting. It\u2019s a basic personality trait, Cred\u00e9 notes \u2014 not something that can be changed.",
            "\u201cStudy habits and skills, test anxiety and class attendance are far more strongly related to performance than grit,\u201d Cred\u00e9 concludes. \u201cWe can teach [students] how to study effectively. We can help them with their test anxiety,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we can do that with grit.\u201d",
            "In the end, hard work can be just as important to success as IQ. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to struggle and go through setbacks,\u201d Kaufman says. It might not be easy. But over the long haul, toughing it out can lead to great accomplishments."

Single-celled parasites called Toxoplasma gondii, for instance, can hijack the minds of rats. The microbes make those zombie rats attracted to the scent of cat pee.

            "Some writers have suggested that yetis are actually giant apes, or even \u201cmissing links\u201d \u2014 the last members of some species that eventually evolved into humans, Naish says. Without a real yeti to study, though, scientists can\u2019t know what a yeti is. But that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have ideas about what they are.",
            "Several scientists have attempted to study material that supposedly has come from yetis. In one 2014 study, for instance, Bryan Sykes at the University of Oxford in England gathered up 30 samples of \u201cyeti\u201d hair. They had been collected by people or were sitting in museums. Sykes\u2019 team searched the hair samples for RNA from mitochondria, which are the structures inside cells that produce energy. RNA molecules help read information from DNA. They also produce proteins that can be used to find out what species the hair had come from.",
            "Most of the hair came from animals that no one would mistake for a yeti. These included porcupines, cows and raccoons. Other hair samples came from Himalayan brown bears. And two appeared similar to hair from an ancient, extinct polar bear. Could ancient polar bears have mated with brown bears to produce modern yetis? Sykes and his colleagues raised that possibility in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
            "Charlotte Lindqvist wasn\u2019t surprised to see that some \u201cyeti\u201d hairs came from bears. But she doubted the possibility they came from polar bears. Lindqvist is an evolutionary biologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo. \u201cWe know there is interbreeding between polar bears and brown bears\u201d up in the Arctic, she says. But as cold and snowy as the Himalayas are, they are thousands of miles from the polar bears\u2019 Arctic home. That\u2019s too far, Lindqvist thought, to make likely any romance between a polar bear and Himalayan brown bear.",
            "A film company asked Lindqvist to study yeti samples. She agreed, but not for the yetis. \u201cI wanted the samples,\u201d she says, \u201cto study the bears.\u201d Little is known about Himalayan bears.",
            "Lindqvist got 24 samples of hair, bones, meat \u2014 even poop. All were said to have come from \u201cyetis.\u201d Lindqvist and her colleagues then analyzed the mitochondrial DNA \u2014 sets of instructions for how mitochondria function \u2014 in each. Of the 24 samples, one came from a dog. All the rest came from Himalayan black or brown bears. The two bear species live on a plateau on either side of the Himalayas. Brown bears live to the northwest; black bears to the southeast. Lindqvist and her colleagues published their findings in 2017, also in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
            "Lindqvist was thrilled. Up until then, she notes, \u201cwe had very little information and genetic data from the Himalayan bears.\u201d Now, she found, \u201cwe got complete mitochondrial DNA sequences and could compare that with other populations of brown bears.\u201d These data would show, she reports, that the two populations of bears had been split for hundreds of thousands of years.",

            "And there are plenty of reasons to keep the hunt alive, Naish adds. \u201cQuite a few large animals have remained unknown to science until recently.\u201d In the end, they were only discovered by chance,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore their discovery, there was no hint that they might exist.

            "When two layers of Earth\u2019s atmosphere overlap, chemicals in each layer can mix and react. These reactions can form the tiny new particles around which clouds begin to form. In fact, this may be the most common way that the seeds for clouds form. That\u2019s the finding of a study in the July 12 Science.",
            "Earth\u2019s atmosphere has five layers. We live in the troposphere. It\u2019s the lowest one. It also has the densest air. The stratosphere, right above it, has thinner air. It also contains different chemicals than those in our layer.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists had thought most new atmospheric particles form in the upper troposphere. Clouds would rise into this region and then shed rain. That rain would carry away the existing particles. Gases left behind would have almost no solid particles left to glom onto. So new clouds would not develop until new particles formed.",
            "In the new study, researchers looked at data collected during a series of flights by NASA aircraft. Many particles are formed when the stratosphere dips a toe into the upper troposphere, they found. They call this stratospheric air intrusion. It\u2019s caused by the jet stream, a fast-moving current of air.",

These gas molecules eagerly react with other gases high above Earth. So there are probably many different chemical reactions going on up there.

The troposphere also contains molecules such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), emitted by fossil fuels and volcanoes. Sunlight and water vapor cause these chemicals to react in ways that generate chemicals such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a building block of tiny aerosol particles. Previous research had suggested that the main way new particles formed were instead \u201ccloud outflows\u201d \u2014 regions where high troposphere clouds break up.",
            "Stratospheric intrusions may be an especially big source of such new particles in Earth\u2019s midlatitudes. Those are regions such as the continental United States \u2014 ones that are not close to either the poles or the Equator.",
            "Climate change is expected to speed up stratospheric circulation. In the future, that could cause the stratosphere to poke into the troposphere more frequently. If it does, stratospheric intrusion may become even more important in forming new particles, Wang says.",
            "This newly reported role for jet streams in particle formation has been long overlooked, says Yuanlong Huang. He did not take part in the new study. An atmospheric aerosol chemist, Huang works at the Eastern Institute for Advanced Study. It\u2019s in Ningbo, China.",
            "Right now, he notes, stratospheric intrusion is not yet accounted for in computer models that simulate weather and climate. In other words, these particles may play a bigger role than scientists once thought in how incoming sunlight is distributed on Earth. That includes how much of the sun\u2019s rays reach the planet\u2019s surface. It also includes how much of the sun\u2019s energy aerosols and clouds absorb high in the atmosphere."

That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",
            "But it\u2019s difficult to study how materials behave under the extreme conditions required for fusion. And that\u2019s where the mayonnaise comes in.",
            "The behavior of the fuel capsule in fusion experiments, it turns out, has a lot in common with mayonnaise. The fuel capsule is a metal or other material that contains a gas (the fuel). When lasers hit the capsule, it melts. The melty capsule can now switch from elastic to plastic.",
            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Two mechanical engineers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., wanted to understand that better. So they looked at how mayo mixes with a gas \u2014 air. Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",
            "The scientists observed the glob while the wheel was spinning. They looked at it again after it stopped. They checked whether the mayo had returned to its original form, changed shape or broken apart. This determined the border between its elastic and plastic behaviors, they explain in the May Physical Review E.",
            "Working with mayo does have one drawback. When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"

            "It\u2019s common to get a minor cut while flipping through a magazine or book. But tissue paper is not likely to draw blood. Now, scientists have explained the physics behind why some paper is more likely to slice through skin.",
            "Physicist Kaare Jensen was part of a team that set up experiments to study this. They used a gelatin replica of human tissue. Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",
            "The most treacherous paper tested was the kind used in old-fashioned dot matrix printers. Good news for fingers everywhere: That paper isn\u2019t used much anymore. Magazine paper ranked a close second in the scientists\u2019 tests.",
            "The slicing angle also mattered. Pressing the paper\u2019s edge straight down into the gelatin was less likely to cause a cut than if the paper\u2019s path angled across and down.",
            "Next, the researchers put paper\u2019s slicing powers to use. They designed a 3-D printed tool they call the Papermachete. Loaded with a strip of printer paper, the tool becomes a single-use knife. The paper blade can cut into cucumber, pepper and apple. It can even cut chicken. The tool could be a low-cost option for prepping some foods.",

In this science project, you will study a simple example of the last type of instrument: a narrow-necked bottle partially filled with water.",
            "How do musical instruments make the sounds that they do? All sound is made by vibrations. The vibrations push and pull on air molecules, changing the air pressure around them. The pushes cause a local compression of the air (increase in air pressure), and the pulls cause a local rarefaction of the air (decrease in air pressure). The compressions and rarefactions are rapidly transmitted through the air from the original source as a wave and are commonly called a sound wave. In summary, sound itself is a wave, a pattern, of changing air pressures.",

The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch. Technically, the\u00a0frequency\u00a0of a wave describes how many cycles of the wave happen during a certain amount of time. This is measured in\u00a0hertz, or cycles per second. On average, the frequency range for human hearing is from 20\u00a0hertz at the low end to 20,000\u00a0hertz at the high end. Figure 2 shows examples of sound waves of two different frequencies. The\u00a0period\u00a0in the wave is the time that it takes for a single cycle of the wave to pass.

            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",

            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",

            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",

This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
