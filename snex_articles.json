            "There were two possibilities when it comes to how brains react to color, says Andreas Bartels. He works at the University of T\u00fcbingen and the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Germany. Perhaps everyone\u2019s brain is unique. Each might have its own snowflake pattern of nerve cells responding when someone sees red. Or it could be that seeing red kicks off a standard, predictable pattern of brain activity. And that pattern might not vary much from you to me.",
            "The answer is overwhelmingly the second option, Bartels and Michael Bannert (also at T\u00fcbingen and the Max Planck Institute) report in the October 15 Journal of Neuroscience. They found \u201ccommonalities across brains,\u201d Bartels says.",
            "He and Bannert started with 15 people. Each viewed shades of reds, greens and yellows. As they did, the scientists monitored nerve-cell activity across visual areas of the participants\u2019 brains. The researchers then used these data to predict which color each person saw.",
            "The results showed that neural reactions to colors are somewhat standard. They don\u2019t seem to vary much from person to person.",
            "But these findings can\u2019t answer how it feels to see red, Bartels says. How your brain creates inner experiences that are unique to you is a much bigger question about consciousness. And it\u2019s one that will no doubt continue to be debated for a long time.",

            "Space junk, also called space debris, refers to trash left in space by humans. This trash includes objects as large as abandoned satellites and as small as flecks of paint.",
            "Humans have been generating space junk for as long as we have been exploring space. This junk includes discarded rocket boosters, old satellites and fragments left over when objects collide. In 2009, for example, two satellites crashed nearly 800 kilometers (about 500 miles) above Siberia. The crash created thousands of new pieces of space junk.",
            "Items lost during space missions make up a small amount of space junk. In 1965, American astronaut Ed White lost a glove during a spacewalk. Other astronauts have lost cameras, tools and even a toothbrush.",
            "Space junk is a growing problem. That\u2019s because it shares the same, well, space, as other objects that orbit Earth. One of those objects is the International Space Station. There\u2019s also weather, communication and other satellites people on Earth rely on.",
            "Objects in orbit around Earth typically zoom at scorching speeds. Space junk can zip around at up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) per second \u2014 or 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles) per hour. At such speeds, any collision \u2014 even with something tiny \u2014 could rip holes in a spacecraft or damage satellites.",
            "More than 36,500 pieces of space junk larger than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) orbit Earth today. They\u2019re joined by more than 300 million even smaller pieces. As more trash ends up in space, more collisions will likely occur. Those collisions will break the trash into smaller \u2014 but still dangerous \u2014 pieces.",
            "Some space junk eventually re-enters the atmosphere. But that can take a long time. Debris orbiting closer to the Earth may fall into the atmosphere after a few years. Objects farther out may take hundreds or thousands of years.",
            "On re-entry, smaller space junk typically burns up in the atmosphere. So, it rarely hits Earth. But large pieces sometimes do. Debris from Skylab \u2014 an abandoned space station \u2014 fell from orbit on July 11, 1979. Chunks of the station fell over Western Australia and the Indian Ocean. Australian officials fined NASA $400 for littering.",

            "The finding comes from a simple experiment. Its inspiration was the Racetrack Playa mystery in Death Valley, Calif. There, boulders weighing as much as 16.6 kilograms (36.6 pounds) seemingly dragged themselves hundreds of meters (yards) across a flat, dry lakebed.",

            "In 2014, scientists traced the rocks\u2019 travels to rain freezing beneath the stones. When it melted, light breezes sent windowpane-thick sheets of ice sailing along atop their own meltwater. These toted the rocks with them. Some rocks sailed along at rates of 2 to 5 meters (6.6 to 16.4 feet) per minute!",
            "Researchers at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg wondered whether they could design a surface to achieve this same effect without wind.",
            "The surface they\u2019ve now engineered not only makes this possible, but also allows ice chunks to slingshot themselves at speeds much faster than the Death Valley boulders.",
            "This was \u201ca shocker,\u201d says Jonathan Boreyko. \u201cI was not expecting [it] at all.\u201d",
            "A mechanical engineer, Boreyko led the work. He and his colleagues debuted their new surface August 27 in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. This cool science might one day be used to de-ice vehicles or generate electricity.",
            "Boreyko has a long history of looking into wacky water phenomena.",
            "He\u2019s studied how to keep frost from forming on scientific instruments in very cold environments. His lab also has studied the Leidenfrost effect. That\u2019s where a droplet of water levitates on its own vapor in a super-hot environment. (You can observe this effect right now \u2014 with supervision! Just sprinkle a few drops of water on a very hot frying pan and watch the droplets dance.)",
            "The Virginia Tech team wasn\u2019t expecting much when it first started investigating whether ice could self-propel. They had thought \u201clet\u2019s just be kids at heart and play around,\u201d Boreyko recalls. Then they\u2019d \u201csee what happens.\u201d",

            "To create a mini racetrack for small sheets of ice, they cut angled grooves into a piece of aluminum. The grooves looked like a series of arrow-shaped channels. Known as a herringbone pattern, it helped guide water from the melting ice to flow in one direction.",
            "Just as predicted, that meltwater ferried the remaining ice. \u201cPicture a person tubing on a lazy river,\u201d Boreyko says. \u201cYou have the ice melting.\u201d And what hasn\u2019t melted \u201cjust kind of goes along for the ride.\u201d It slides along \u201cvery slowly and methodically.\u201d",
            "The team then made a second version of the surface. They coated this one with a waterproof spray. And it was this one that really surprised them.",
            "They expected the ice to move across it a bit faster, says Boreyko. Instead, it lagged at first. Sometimes, it took almost half a minute to start moving. But then it suddenly accelerated \u2014 almost like a slingshot. The ice sailed across this surface 10 times faster than in the first experiment.",

            "fCAfter coating a grooved surface with a waterproofing spray, scientists found that small ice chunks would start moving slowly, then speedily propel themselves \u2014 despite no outside push.",
            "A closer look revealed that this slingshot effect came from a difference in pressure at the front and back of the ice. At the front, meltwater spilled out in a flat puddle. Water couldn\u2019t flow out as easily at the back. So the meltwater built up there.",
            "This \u201ccreates a giant mismatch in surface tension that keeps building and building. Kind of like how your hand keeps pulling back more and more on the slingshot,\u201d Boreyko explains. \u201cFinally, that force is so dramatic that it unsticks the ice from the surface and slingshots it across.\u201d",
            "The slingshot effect may be flashy. But it could prove \u201cdifficult to scale up,\u201d says Dan Daniel, an applied physicist. It also \u201clacks long-term durability,\u201d he adds. Daniel works at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology in Japan. What he finds most interesting about the new work is that the herringbone pattern alone can create and guide movement.",
            "\u201cThe fact that propulsion can be driven simply by geometric structuring \u2014 without the need for specialized surface treatments \u2014 is a key strength of the paper,\u201d he says.",
            "Xuehua Zhang is a materials engineer in Canada at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. She can imagine several potential uses for the slick discovery. One idea: Developing new ways to de-ice surfaces. \u201cI even think it may be possible to convert the kinetic energy of the ice block to other forms of energy,\u201d she says. \u201cFor example, electricity.\u201d",
            "Boreyko had that idea as well. Instead of going in a straight line, he imagines an ice chunk moving in a circle to rotate a turbine. But that idea is on the back burner for now. His lab is currently looking into how the slingshot effect might be used to sweep ice off surfaces such as car windshields.",
            "What started as a \u201cfun side project\u201d now has the potential to make a serious impact, Boreyko says. This goes to show that you never know where your curiosity might take you.",

That\u2019s a key part of the chocolate-making process where microbes convert sugars and other molecules in the beans and pulp (white surrounding beans inside the pod, middle and left) into fine flavors.",
            "The flavor of chocolate can vary a lot from piece to piece. Some chocolate treats may have a slight fruity tang. Others may carry hints of floral or even nutty flavors. Scientists knew that soil, rainfall and other conditions on cocoa bean farms shaped chocolate\u2019s taste. But new research now shows that the flavor of chocolate depends mostly on the wild microbes that ferment the cocoa beans.",
            "One might think cocoa plants\u2019 DNA would determine the taste of chocolate. But \u201cfermentation also is driving the flavor,\u201d says David Gopaulchan. \u201cI would even argue, [it] has an even bigger impact on the flavor.\u201d Gopaulchan studies plant genetics at the University of Nottingham in England. He and his colleagues shared the new findings in the September\u00a0Nature Microbiology.",
            "Past studies have identified microbes involved in cocoa fermentation. But this work \u201cpulled out all the stops to try to understand the process,\u201d says Rachel Dutton. This microbiologist wasn\u2019t involved in the work. But her company Microcosm Foods in Berkeley, Calif., studies fermented foods.",
            "Gopaulchan\u2019s team worked with three women-owned farms in Colombia. All grow similar strains of cocoa. Two of the farms produced fine chocolate while the third made bulk chocolate. (Fine chocolates\u2019 floral, fruity and other subtle flavors set them apart from plain bulk chocolate.)",
            "The researchers tracked the temperature and pH in fermenting beans from each farm. They also tracked the microbes at each stage of the process.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Yeasts were some of the first microbes to belly up to the chocolate bar. They broke down sugars in the beans, turning them to alcohol. This process created heat within 24 hours of fermentation. That heat killed the beans and kept them from sprouting.",
            "After 48 hours, some types of bacteria began to multiply. Those bacteria turned the alcohol made by the yeasts into acids. That increased the pH of the bean batch. The bacteria also further broke down the beans and the pulp that surrounded them. Other yeasts and bacteria soon joined the party. They turned the compounds made by earlier microbes into tasty molecules.",
            "The timing and speed of the temperature and pH changes are key for making flavors, says Aimee Dudley. So are the transitions between microbes, she adds. Dudley studies yeast genetics but was not involved in the new study. She works at the Pacific Northwest Research Institute in Seattle, Wash.",
            "Gopaulchan and colleagues wondered if they could put together microbe teams to mimic what they\u2019d seen. To find out, they looked at the DNA of the microbes involved in fermenting the beans. That allowed them to pick out microbes linked to certain flavor compounds. They could then predict a combo of microbes that should produce the two farms\u2019 fine chocolate flavors.",
            "The researchers put together bacteria-yeast mixes and fermented small batches of beans in the lab. A panel of expert tasters tested the lab-fermented beans. They confirmed that the flavors did match the two farms\u2019 chocolates. Some of those flavors included notes of orange blossom, citrus and tropical fruit.",

            "fCYeast are the first microbes to start fermenting cocoa beans. These beans are drying after fermentation on a chocolate-producing farm in Huila, Colombia. Yeasts convert sugars in the beans and pulp to alcohol. They also make other chemical compounds. Bacteria then alter those molecules, producing flavors.",
            "The lab mix wasn\u2019t perfect, though. It lacked caramel, nut and light wood flavors from the farm-made chocolates. It also had more grassy notes than the fine chocolates did.",
            "Still, the study shows that microbes that ferment cocoa form predictable communities, says Dutton. She has found similar predictable bunches of\u00a0fungi and bacteria in cheese. In cheese and chocolate, different strains of local microbes bring their own flavors.",
            "In the future, lab-made microbe mixes could be used to produce designer flavors, Gopaulchan says. They could create flavors that don\u2019t exist. Or ones that are hard to find in natural fermentation.",
            "But some chocolate makers aren\u2019t on board with that idea. Take Luisa Bedi and Martyn O\u2019Dare. They make chocolate at Luisa\u2019s Vegan Chocolates in Nottingham, England. Lab-made microbe mixes \u201cwould be very much rejected by the craft chocolate producers and market,\u201d they say. Using pre-mixed microbes could reduce the variety of chocolate flavors. And there\u2019s no need for those mixes when \u201cgood farming practices already produce great tasting chocolate.\u201d",
            "Lab-based microbes might also make too much of some compounds that flavor fine chocolates, Dudley says. \u201cHumans have a very sharp boundary for what tastes really good and what tastes awful,\u201d she says. \u201cYeast make the amount of those compounds at exactly that boundary of what humans think is palatable.\u201d Messing with the mixes could cross the line. And that could turn chocolate from delicious to disgusting.",

            "Many people think getting their daily vitamins means downing multivitamin pills or supplement capsules. In fact, most doctors and nutritionists would prefer we rely on food as the main source of these essential nutrients.",
            "If you were asked to choose a healthy snack, what would it be? Perhaps you\u2019d opt for a tangy mango or cup of tart Greek yogurt topped with berries. Maybe crunchy broccoli florets with hummus comes to mind. These are all packed with nutrients \u2014 chemical substances that help our bodies function. Among those nutrients are traces of vitamins.",
            "Food scientists group vitamins and minerals together as micronutrients. That\u2019s because living things need these to survive \u2014 but only in tiny amounts. While both vitamins and minerals are essential, chemically they\u2019re quite different.",
            "Dietary minerals are elements that appear in soil and water. Calcium and iron are examples. Vitamins, in contrast, are molecules \u2014 made of several elements. Vitamins are also organic, meaning they contain the element carbon. ",
            "Our bodies can\u2019t make minerals or most vitamins. That\u2019s why we must get them from what we eat.Altogether, we need 13 vitamins to stay healthy. Eight are known as B vitamins. Rounding out the list are vitamins A, C, D, E and K. These all play essential roles in keeping our organs, tissues and cells working.",
            "Some, such as the B vitamins, help the body break down and release energy from food. Vitamin K allows our blood to clot. Vitamin A is important for our lungs, skin and eyes.Vitamin D is a pro-hormone. The kidneys turn it into a fully active hormone. And it\u2019s quite versatile. This hormone plays a pivotal role in building strong bones and muscles and protecting the body from diseases, including some cancers. This vitamin also helps fight infections.",
            "Other vitamins \u2014 such as C and E \u2014 are antioxidants. They help protect against unstable molecules. At high levels, such molecules, called radicals, can damage cells and DNA.",
            "Vitamin C also supports your immune system in various ways. For instance, it helps keep immune cells healthy. But vitamin C also helps create collagen. A protein, collagen serves as a building block for many tissues, including our skin and the lining of our respiratory system. Those organs act as early lines of defense against incoming germs, explains Evangeline Mantzioris. She directs nutrition and food science at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.By keeping these systems healthy, vitamins help our bodies fight germs, limiting their chance of causing serious disease.",
            "Clearly, Mantzioris says, vitamins don\u2019t just target one specific body function or organ. They make sure our bodies as a whole work as they should.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Vitamins fall into two general categories: water-soluble and fat-soluble.",
            "Most vitamins dissolve easily in water. That means they can be found in such body fluids as blood. These vitamins include all eight B types and vitamin C.",
            "\u201cWe tend to find the water-soluble vitamins in fruits and vegetables,\u201d says Mantzioris. These are \u201cfoods that don\u2019t have a lot of fat.\u201d Our bodies don\u2019t usually store any excess of water-soluble vitamins. Instead, unused amounts get flushed out in our urine.\u00a0",

            "fCDairy products, seeds, eggs and meats are rich in not only protein but also the fat-soluble vitamins A, D and E. For fat-soluble vitamin K, reach for broccoli and other green (and often leafy) vegetables, beans, avocados, vegetable oils and some meats (such as chicken, pork and especially beef liver). ",
            "Fat-soluble vitamins \u2014 A, D, E and K \u2014 tend to show up in fatty foods. In fact, that fat helps our bodies better absorb these nutrients. Our liver and body will store any extra of these vitamins that we might consume until they\u2019re needed later. \u201cEven if we\u2019re really lean, we still have a little bit of a fat stored in our body,\u201d says Mantzioris. ",
            "The fat-soluble group also includes the two vitamins that people can produce: vitamins D and K. Bacteria in our intestines can make vitamin K.\u00a0",
            "Vitamin D is special. Known as the sunshine vitamin, our skin starts a process of making it by using the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light. Today, most people lack ideal amounts. One reason: Covering up the body too much when in the sun. Sunscreen helps protect against skin cancers but limits vitamin D production. So does spending most of the daylight hours indoors. Darkly pigmented skin and very heavy cloud cover can limit exposure to the UV light that kick-starts vitamin D production. So can living at high latitudes, where a steep path through the atmosphere can filter out much of the sun\u2019s ultraviolet light.\u00a0",

            "The first half of this short video shows how the body absorbs vitamins, transports them to where they\u2019re needed and, where possible, stores any excess. The second half shows the many functions these vitamins have in supporting our health.",
            "Most of the vitamins we need can be found in the foods we eat. While fruits and veggies are well-known for being rich in vitamins, meat and grains contain these essential nutrients, too.",
            "Vitamins are also available as food supplements sold widely in stores and over the internet. Many are synthetic preparations; others come from plant or animal sources. Some products may include single vitamins. Others may contain a blend meant to meet our daily needs.",

            "Whole foods contain more than just vitamins. For instance, oranges are an excellent source of vitamin C. But these and other types of fresh produce also contain hundreds of other nutrients that aren\u2019t found in artificial supplements, Mantzioris points out. These include plant compounds called phytonutrients. Such compounds give many fruits and veggies their vibrant colors. Scientists suspect they also boost health and fight disease. And new ones are still being discovered. ",
            "Supplements can be useful, though. People with certain medical conditions may need help getting enough of some vitamins. And it\u2019s hard to reach the recommended amount of vitamin D through food alone. Vitamin D supplements may help those with heavily pigmented skin or whose skin doesn\u2019t get access to enough of the sun\u2019s UV rays.But these supplements should only be taken after talking with your doctor, says Mantzioris. One reason: Mixing vitamin supplements with certain medications can be risky. ",
            "Some vitamins, such as A, can be toxic when taken in high amounts. But poisoning is highly unlikely to happen when they\u2019re consumed as part of a balanced diet. Most people who consume too many vitamins do so by taking supplements.Taking too many supplements also risks flooding the body with more nutrients than it can handle. Fat-soluble vitamins can build up in our fat stores over time, leading to dangerous side effects. Even overdosing on some water-soluble vitamins can pose problems.Cases of poisoning from water-soluble vitamin B6, for instance, are on the rise in Australia, notes Mantzioris. In addition to supplements, this nutrient is often added to energy drinks, weight-loss shakes and certain food products. One symptom of too much B6 is nerve damage. It often starts as a tingling in the fingers and toes. \u201cIf it\u2019s not caught in time, it can cause permanent damage,\u201d Mantzioris says.Instead of splurging on supplements, Mantzioris recommends that people looking to stay healthy should focus on a food-first approach. \u201cPeople spend a lot of money on these [vitamin supplements] \u2014 and mostly without a lot of gain,\u201d says Mantzioris. \u201cI would rather spend the money on having really yummy food.\u201d",

He\u2019s a materials chemist at the University of Limerick in Ireland. But in many ways, PFAS are more like villains than heroes. Because they\u2019re so tough, PFAS that get into the environment stick around for a long time. They pollute soils, food and drinking water. Exposure to those chemicals has been linked to health problems.",

PFAS molecules can line the surfaces of all these nooks and crannies.",

These differences changed how PFAS interacted with the MOFs. The researchers also took each of these four MOFs and added a layer of organosilicone (OS). Changing the surface this way can change how PFAS sticks. That gave the team a total of eight materials to test \u2014 the original and OS-coated version of each MOF.",
            "Some of the MOFs grabbed more PFAS than activated carbon did. (Activated carbon took up only 40 percent of one forever chemical called PFOA. It took up 71 percent of another called PFOS.) The new materials also trapped forever chemicals in less than 30 minutes. That was much faster than activated carbon worked. Washing the MOFs in acetone or other common lab chemicals removed the PFAS they\u2019d collected. The MOFs could be used to filter drinking water, washed and then used again.",

            "Have you ever wondered why leaves change from green to an amazing array of yellow, orange and red hues during the fall?",
            "Leaves get their brilliant colors from pigments made up of various color-creating molecules. During the warm, sunny months, plants use their leaves to turn sunlight into food energy, a process called photosynthesis. This primarily uses a pigment that reflects green light, which gives the leaves their characteristic color. In autumn, when colder, shorter days arrive, many kinds of trees no longer make food energy with their leaves and, consequently, no longer need the green pigment. The leaves\u2019 other pigments \u2014 some of which were already there during summer \u2014 become visible.",
            "In this science activity, you will uncover these hidden colors by separating plant pigments with a process called paper chromatography. What colors will you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/YxOSHj_kVlA?feature=oembed",
            "In this science activity, let\u2019s use paper chromatography to uncover the hidden pigments lurking in tree leaves.",
            "Because some plant pigments can stain, be careful not to spill your colored solutions when throwing them away.",
            "Even though a plant leaf looks like it is mostly one color, it is actually made up of a mixture of pigment molecules. In this activity, a scientific technique called\u00a0paper chromatography\u00a0was used to separate the individual color pigments. You should see different colors at different locations as you go along one of the paper towel strips, and the order in which the colors appear should be roughly the same among the different color solutions you tested.",
            "What are the different bands of color on the test strips? These are the different pigments in the leaves. The ones you may see on your paper towel strips are: green chlorophyll, yellow xanthophylls, orange carotenoids and red anthocyanins. Pigments travel along the paper strip based on their interactions with the paper strip and the isopropyl alcohol solution. Pigments that are more attracted to the paper strip than the isopropyl alcohol stay near the bottom of the strip, where the solution was first \u201cpainted\u201d onto the pencil line. Pigments that are more attracted to the alcohol than the paper strip usually travel farther up the strip. Because the color of the leaf depends on the mixture of pigments in it, different colored leaves will display different colors on their paper towel strips. For example, very green leaves may not have any red colors (anthocyanins) on their strips.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/TtAENPSThI4?feature=oembed",
            "Want to know more about paper chromatography? Science Buddies explains.",
            "There are many types of pigments in plant leaves. Chlorophyll makes them look green and helps carry out photosynthesis during warm, sunny months. As fall arrives and the green, food-making color fades, other pigments such as yellow, orange and red ones become more visible.",
            "Xanthophylls are yellow pigments, and carotenoids give leaves an orange color. Photosynthesis also uses these pigments during the summer, but chlorophyll, a stronger pigment, overpowers them. These pigments take more time to break down than chlorophyll does, so you see them become visible in fall leaves. They are also found in carrots, daffodils, bananas and other plants that have these vibrant colors.",
            "There are also anthocyanins, intense red pigments that are not made during the summer, only appearing with the final group of the fall colors. These molecules also give the red hue to apples, cranberries, strawberries and more.",
            "Although a leaf is a mixture of these pigments, you can separate the colors using a method called\u00a0paper chromatography. In this method, a mixture (such as your pigment mixture) is applied onto a chromatography paper. The paper strip is dipped into a liquid, called the solvent or mobile phase. The liquid will start traveling up the paper strip and carry all the components within the mixture (such as your different color pigments) along through the chromatography paper. While traveling up the paper, each component interacts with the paper and the solvent differently depending on its chemical properties. Some of them are more attracted to the paper, whereas others prefer to stay in the mobile phase. As a result, each individual component travels along the paper at a different speed. This is how with paper chromatography a colorful mixture of pigment molecules can be separated into each individual pigment component.",

            "Rip off a piece of tape in a dark room and you may see a flash of light. This happens because the peeling tape releases energy that creates tiny sparks. It might seem like just a neat little trick. But scientists have now shown this \u201cmicro-lightning\u201d is shockingly powerful. In fact, it can be strong enough to drive chemical reactions in the air.",
            "One day, such micro-sparks could help make some chemicals in a more sustainable way.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve been very interested in the idea of micro-lightning,\u201d says Richard Zare. A chemist, he works at Stanford University in California. His team recently showed sprays of water release tiny sparks that can drive chemical reactions. Now, working with Xinxing Zhang, a physical chemist in China, his team is studying micro-lightning sparked by peeling tape.",
            "fCWatch the glow from electrons jumping as tape is peeled off a roll in the dark.",
            "Using tape was Zhang\u2019s idea. Ripping tape loose from its roll releases visible light. But Zhang knew it also, surprisingly, generates X-rays. He wondered how high this electric charge was and if it sparked chemical reactions. To find out, his team at Nankai University in Tianjin set up an experiment.\u00a0",
            "They started with a roll of sticky tape placed on a bearing. With a motor, they pulled off the tape and wound it around a cylinder. Along the way, the team measured the strength of the electric field that the peeling tape created. They also looked for any changes in the chemistry of the surrounding air.",
            "The test setup pulls tape off a roll and onto a cylinder. A motor controls its speed. The unrolling tape sits on a device (XY translational stage) that can move back and forth. This positions the peeling point in front of a mass spectrometer (Extended MS inlet), which identifies chemicals formed as the zapping triggers air chemicals to react.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_tape_test_setup_used_in_the_lab",
            "fCXufeng Gao",
            "Peeling the tape slowly, at 12.5 centimeters (5 inches) per second, created a small electric field. But when the motor sped up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) per second, the space where the tape left the roll became very highly charged. Zhang\u2019s group tallied a billion volts per meter across this tiny space!",
            "That\u2019s an astonishing voltage \u2014 far beyond what\u2019s usually achieved in the lab, Zare points out. (For perspective, lightning shoots from a storm cloud when the voltage is 3 million volts per meter. In the tape experiment, the high voltage is across too small of a space for the micro-lightning to hurt us.)",
            "The peeling tape\u2019s zap illustrates the triboelectric effect. This is the generation of an electric charge as materials come into contact and then separate. It\u2019s like static electricity, when two objects are rubbed together then moved apart. One object becomes positively charged, meaning it loses electrons. The other gains those lost electrons and becomes negatively charged. (This can make a negatively charged balloon repel electrons from a wall, then \u201cstick\u201d to the positively charged surface. Or, it can send out a tiny zap of electricity.)",
            "The triboelectric effect is at work all around us \u2014 in things as simple as a sliding raindrop and the rustle of our clothes. But the tape experiment created a much higher voltage than most other everyday triboelectric events. Why? Being sticky, the tape peeled off the roll in a jerky way. Scientists call this a \u201cstick\u2013slip\u201d event. It leads to higher charges than when things just rub together or touch.",
            "A high electric field emerged only when the tape was pulled quickly, Zare says. If that electric field is high enough, electrons from the tape will speed up and smash into air molecules or other molecules in the tape. This \u201cleads to a spark that drives chemical reactions,\u201d says Zare. Those electrons flowing between the tape\u2019s surfaces can create a high enough voltage around the tape to break down molecules in the air, he says \u2014 turning them into ions.",
            "Zare\u2019s team repeated what Zhang\u2019s team had done. This time, they also looked to see if molecules of water vapor in the air near the tape would break up and form into new molecules. They did.",
            "Next, Zare\u2019s group put chemicals they suspected would react as vapors in the electric field next to the peeling tape. This was to test a common reaction used in industrial chemistry. (It\u2019s one where pyridine and methyl iodide are reacted to form something new.) Right away, Zare\u2019s group detected new products as these chemicals now reacted.",
            "The team shared its new findings June 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

            "\u201cThis is a fabulous discovery,\u201d says Thalappil Pradeep. A chemist, he studies triboelectricity at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai. There is a lot to discover about what\u2019s happening at the tiny space where the peeling tape first makes contact with the air, he says.",
            "Daniel Lacks agrees. This chemical engineer works at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually look at what\u2019s happening in that little, teeny distance\u201d between two nearly touching surfaces, he says. His own work has focused on particles that pick up an electric charge after rubbing against each other.\u00a0",

            "Guiding chemical reactions with triboelectricity is one type of green chemistry, Ciampi notes. Here, electricity can do work typically done by chemicals that may be toxic. So this approach, he concludes, can be more environmentally friendly.",
            "Chemicals often react through a series of steps. Some may require separating positive and negative charges within a molecule. By controlling those electric charges, you can manage the reaction\u2019s steps to help choose what product you end up with, Ciampi explains.",
            "Indeed, a huge number of chemical reactions are sensitive to electric fields. But there\u2019s often a challenge in using an electric field to guide reactions. The problem, Ciampi says, is the electrically conducting materials used to make the field. Those materials can interfere with the reacting chemicals, which could prevent the desired results.",
            "That\u2019s why Ciampi is excited about this new research. It shows how a material that\u2019s not electrically conductive, such as tape, can create an electric field \u2014 and drive reactions without interfering with them. This, he says, could open \u201can entirely new space in chemistry.\u201d",

In contrast, these massive bolts can discharge electricity for spans lasting up to 100 milliseconds. They might infuse their energy into a tree or other target. That might even become the powerful trigger for a wildfire.",

            "For hundreds of years, we\u2019ve been able to see cells through microscopes. As these spyglasses have gotten more powerful, they\u2019ve been able to zoom in on smaller and smaller details. Yet even when you can see individual microbes, most look pretty similar.",

So to \u201cincrease our understanding and build a database,\u201d Harel says, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to do a lot of experiments on different viruses in different environments.\u201d",
            "Another issue: Many microbes belong to species with lots of related members \u2014 strains that you might think of like siblings. Consider E. coli. These bacteria live almost everywhere. Although most are harmless to people, a few strains can cause serious disease. Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",
            "To find out, scientists will have to just keep listening. Once they have a robust library of sounds, they may be able to tell most microbes apart. That because microbial sounds are very specific, Harel says. It\u2019s like listening for a friend\u2019s voice in a loud place. Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",
            "There\u2019s plenty of research left to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at biology,\u201d Harel explains. For now, he says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see because very few people have ever looked.\u201d",
            "But one day, this type of tech might prove useful beyond the lab. For instance, it could be used in sensors installed at airports and other crowded places. These could then listen for worrisome microbes \u2014 and send out warnings of which ones (and how many) are out there.",

            "Some people see a pickleball and want to smash it. When Anchal Sareen saw some pickleballs lying around a lab a few years ago, she thought about submarines and airplanes. As a mechanical engineer who studies how fluids affect movement, she couldn\u2019t help it. So she went right out, bought a balloon and wrapped it around the pickleball. It became the inspiration for a new surface to speed and steer aircrafts and underwater drones.",
            "The surface has dimples, like a golf ball. But they\u2019re adjustable. Add air and the dimples smooth out. Remove air and the dimples deepen.",

Drag is the friction-like force that slows things down as they travel through a fluid. They\u2019ve also shown how changing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dimples can help steer an object through air, water or other fluids.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a cool idea,\u201d says Christopher Douglas at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Drag is a big challenge, he says. \u201cAnything you can do to minimize drag is great,\u201d says this mechanical engineer who did not work on the new skin.",

            "But drag isn\u2019t always a bad thing, he adds.",
            "Fins and rudders guide a ship by increasing drag in one place more than in another. This nudges a ship in a desired direction. And dimples might help here, too, says Sareen. She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",

            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",

            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",

But at Texas A&M, \u201cthe air smells beautiful,\u201d says Renyi Zhang. The campus is about 100 miles away from the closest big city. Here, he notes, the air is usually safe to breathe.",
            "But that may not be true during heat waves. Zhang\u2019s team collected data on campus. During a month-long event in August 2024, daytime temps hit 32\u02da to 41\u02da Celsius (90\u02da to 106\u02da Fahrenheit). And it wasn\u2019t just the heat that made these days uncomfortable. Pollution ramped up, too. Levels of lung-irritating ozone got especially high. It rose nearly to a level deemed hazardous to breathe.",

            "Bianca Aridjis-Olivos, a graduate student in his lab, set up air-monitoring equipment atop the university\u2019s meteorology building. It\u2019s surrounded by grand oak trees. It seemed a good location. It\u2019s high above passing cars and other expected pollution sources.",
            "The instruments she used are \u201clike a super-sensitive nose,\u201d she notes. By changing how they operate, she could alter \u201cwhat scents the nose could detect.\u201d Besides ozone, they could pick up nitrogen oxides from combustion (including gasoline-powered vehicles).",
            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

            "Learn why isoprene \u2014 a chemical released by trees (and lots of other plants) \u2014 can make air pollution worse. It\u2019s the second most widely emitted volatile organic chemical (after methane) in the world. The chemistry explained here underlies the data reported in the new study.",
            "Once all her equipment was ready, Aridjis-Olivos waited for the next heat wave.",
            "It hit in August 2024. From August 5 to September 3, she sampled different gases and particles from the air 24 hours a day.",
            "As the temps rose each day, so did levels of ozone, oxygenated volatile organic chemicals (some of which are toxic to human airways) and acid-rich nanoparticles. Ozone levels, in particular, climbed as the heat rose. Then they stayed high throughout the hottest part of the day. That in itself was no surprise. Trees ramp up isoprene release during heat waves. Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",
            "The surprise was just how high the ozone levels climbed. If you just looked at the levels of other pollutants, like the nitrogen oxides from cars, you might think the air was safe to breathe.",
            "And while a heat wave feels miserable, says Zhang, \u201cexposure to both extreme heat and high ozone can be very dangerous.\u201d",
            "This research shows how \u201cclimate change is making air pollution harder to control,\u201d says Russ Dickerson. An atmospheric chemist, he works at the University of Maryland in College Park. Air pollution is a leading cause of death, he notes. The World Health Organization reports that today 99 percent of people worldwide are exposed to air unhealthy enough to pose a risk to our lungs.",
            "Clearly, trees play a role here. But chopping them down would be the wrong conclusion, he adds. \u201cTrees are generally good. But when you mix them with car and truck exhaust, bad things happen.\u201d",

An atmospheric scientist, she works at Howard University in Washington, D.C. With such computer models, she says, \u201cWe can better predict bad-air days during heat waves.\u201d And that should help protect people\u2019s health.",
            "Data from this study are not limited to modeling sites like College Station, Aridjis-Olivos says. Being \u201csurrounded by vegetation, but also some industry and traffic,\u201d this region is similar to what\u2019s found many places, including in many developing nations.",

            "If you can\u2019t avoid a heat wave, how can you protect yourself from air pollution that may come with it? Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible. Remember to check your local air quality index when making plans, Yarber says. \u201cKids are especially sensitive to air pollution,\u201d she notes, \u201cbecause their lungs are still growing.\u201d",
            "At home, Dickerson recommends getting a low-cost HEPA filter from a hardware store. For breathing \u201ccleaner air \u2014 averaged over a day \u2014 put a HEPA filter in your bedroom,\u201d he says. As an alternative, you can even duct-tape five furnace filters together. Then direct air through it with an electric fan. Remember to keep the windows closed.",
            "There are also ways to improve outdoor air quality. For instance, communities can work to limit becoming \u201cheat islands.\u201d Two obvious ways: Increase shaded area, and limit how much heat-absorbing concrete they have.",
            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change? Planting trees.",

            "Since 2016, people had been collecting hailstones across 15 provinces in China.

But new data show that for the tiniest fliers, there\u2019s a better way: brushes.",
            "The littlest insects are smaller than a grain of rice. Their wings look like tiny bristles or feather dusters, with visible air gaps throughout. It\u2019s a clever adaptation for flying when you\u2019re incredibly small, the new work shows.",

He works at the University of Manchester in England and had no role in the new research. Bristled wings, this aerospace engineer suspects, might help make such super-mini robots possible.",
            "For more than a decade, Dmitry Kolomenskiy has been part of a team puzzling over why small insects evolved bristled wings. A computational scientist, he works at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. That\u2019s in Moscow, Russia.",
            "For answers, his team gathered data on 38 species of tiny beetles. Their wings ranged in length from just 0.3 to 5 millimeters (0.01 to 0.2 inch). That\u2019s very small \u2014 from the width of a couple hairs to about the size of a few grains of sand laid end to end. Many of the beetles came from Russia and Vietnam.",
            "Back in the lab, the researchers used microscopes to measure the shape of each wing and count its bristles. And with high-speed cameras, they tracked how fast the beetles\u2019 wings flapped in flight.",
            "To their surprise, the beetles flapped at about the same speed regardless of the wings\u2019 size. That\u2019s unusual, Kolomenskiy says. Among birds and larger insects, smaller wings usually flap faster.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/txPvulerOW4?feature=oembed",
            "This featherwing beetle flaps its bristled wings in a wide stroke. In 2022, Kolomenskiy and other scientists found that bristled wings help these tiny beetles fly very fast. Now, their research shows how the tiny bristles work and how their size and structure changes with a species\u2019 size.",
            "It comes down to how these wings interact with air, Kolomenskiy now concludes. To humans and other large animals, air feels light and breezy. But insects that are just a few millimeters long experience air very differently, he points out. \u201cAt these small scales, they really feel air like a very viscous media,\u201d he explains.",
            "\u201cThink of maple syrup,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get [that] kind of flow for air, if you are very small.\u201d",
            "Fluids, it turns out, behave differently at small scales. Viscous forces now dominate. Here, air doesn\u2019t easily slip through small gaps the way it does at larger scales. Instead, it flows slowly and sticks to surfaces, like syrup clinging to a spoon.",
            "As a result, tiny insects \u201care almost not flying in the air,\u201d says Nabawy, the aerospace engineer. \u201cThey are actually swimming in the air.\u201d",
            "Because the air acts like a thick, syrupy liquid, it doesn\u2019t flow through the gaps in a tiny wing\u2019s bristles. Instead, it gets \u201cstuck\u201d and flows around the bristles.",
            "\u201cVisually, it looks like there\u2019s a lot of void between [the bristles],\u201d says Kolomenskiy. \u201cBut for the [air], it\u2019s not transparent. The flow goes around.\u201d",

            "Gaps between bristles increased as a wing got smaller, they found. The tiniest wings (0.3 to 0.5 millimeter) had the fewest bristles, and they were spaced farthest apart. Wings with fewer bristles weigh less. That helps these insects flap at high speeds without using much energy, Kolomenskiy observes.",
            "Longer wings \u2014 those more than about 1.7 millimeters \u2014 evolved more bristles and ones that are more closely spaced. As those bristles get very tightly packed, they eventually start to look more like a membrane.",

That\u2019s the force needed to keep things aloft. The computer model showed that both the bristles and what they attach to need enough rigidity to hold the wing\u2019s shape during each flap.",

            "\u201cWe needed something more precise [than a drop of liquid],\u201d Gill says. \u201cAnd then we thought \u2018Oh, hey, we already have floss. \u2026 Why don\u2019t we just use [floss] to also deposit the vaccines into this location?\u201d",
            "He proposed testing this in mice. But that immediately raised the issue: How do you floss a mouse? No one had ever done that. Rohan Ingrole, a bioengineer at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, accepted the challenge.",
            "That led to even more questions. What\u2019s the best way to open a mouse\u2019s mouth? How does one get the floss in the right spot? And is there a way to protect the mouse\u2019s gums from damage?",
            "Initial tests flopped. While gently moving the floss back and forth over the bottom front teeth (incisors), the animals\u2019 jaws dropped down. Right away, the floss slipped out.",
            "\u201cOne day, after a failed attempt, I was just going around [the lab] and I saw this key chain lying on the table,\u201d Ingrole recalls. \u201cIt made me wonder: Can I use the ring of this key chain to provide support to the mouse jaw?\u201d That, he now says, \u201cturned out to be a game changer.\u201d\u00a0",
            "It worked. Yet even with this support tool, flossing a mouse is a two-person job.",
            "First, the mouse must be lulled into deep sleep with an inhaled anesthetic. Then, one person must gently hold the mouse in an upright position by the scruff of its neck. That person also pops the mouse\u2019s head through the key ring. This allows the animal\u2019s lower jaw to stay open and rest against the ring\u2019s edge. The second person then plays dental hygienist with a vaccine-coated piece of floss.",
            "See how floss can apply a dye (which glows under ultraviolet light) to a mouse\u2019s gum pocket on its right lower incisor. Scientists also made floss coated with different types of vaccines. These can be used to vaccinate mice against disease. One day we may be able to treat ourselves this way.",
            "That floss had been coated with a vaccine made from dead flu viruses or lab-made bits and pieces of them. With each swipe back and forth, that floss delivered the vaccine through the gum\u2019s junctional epithelium.",
            "The team tried four different types of vaccines. All boosted immune defenses in the mice. Eating or drinking right after flossing didn\u2019t affect how well the vaccine worked. What\u2019s more, the flossed vaccine was similar to a vaccine inhaled through the nose.",
            "Giving vaccine with floss may even be a bit safer than a nasal mist. Why? Noses have a direct connection to the brain, Gill notes. So safety tests of nasal vaccines must show there\u2019s no big risk of side effects in the brain. Vaccines given through the gums, by contrast, are unlikely to reach the brain.",
            "Gill and Ingrole\u2019s team shared its new findings July 22 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very clever, I like the strategy,\u201d says Stephanie Langel. She\u2019s a viral immunologist who did not take part in the new work. Langel works at Case Western Reserve University. That\u2019s in Cleveland, Ohio.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Both nasal and floss vaccines triggered immune defenses in the blood of mice. So both vaccines may help prevent severe disease and death. But compared to the floss vaccine, the nasal type caused more antibodies to hang out in mucosal linings (such as those in the nose), the new study found. And that means nasal vaccines might be better at preventing one individual from passing a virus to another, Langel says.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/N6KvqNDErp0?feature=oembed",
            "Here\u2019s why they think this flossing vaccine delivery may work in people too.",
            "The floss vaccine might be improved, however, by adding the right adjuvant (ADD-ju-vunt). This is some chemical or other material that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to some foreign substance. This might help the body make more antibodies in places like the saliva or nose. In turn, that should protect against invading germs.",
            "The floss vaccine has been tested in 27 human volunteers. The researchers coated a one-handed floss pick with a dye. It glows under UV light. Then the volunteers flossed their teeth. Afterward, the researchers used UV light to search for the dye. Flossing had deposited roughly 60 percent of the floss\u2019 vaccine into people\u2019s gum pockets, they found.",
            "Now the goal is to make flossing easier, Gill says, and to ensure that people are getting a consistent dose.",
            "Such vaccines might one day provide a painless, needle-free way to vaccinate, he says. And if people are comfortable with flossing their teeth with a vaccine, they could do it at home.",
            "In fact, self-vaccinations could be huge during a pandemic, Ingrole says. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scores of health-care workers had to help with vaccination efforts. \u201cImagine if you had this vaccine that could just get delivered at your doorstep,\u201d Ingrole says. To get a vaccine, he notes, you\u2019d \u201cno longer have to go stand in line for hours.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"
