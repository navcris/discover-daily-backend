            "An almendro tree stands tall (front and center) in this jungle. Researchers think the height and large crown of this species can turn it into what\u2019s essentially a lightning rod; it attracts storms to discharge into them bolts of energy that are potentially lethal to their competitors.",
            "Getting hit by lightning is not usually good. But one tropical tree seems to invite heaven\u2019s wrath. In fact, it can benefit from a powerful electric jolt or two.",
            "The height and broad crowns of almendro trees (Dipteryx oleifera) act as natural lightning rods. They not only can survive a powerful bolt of lightning, but actually attract it. In a dense jungle, such zaps can even give the tree a competitive advantage. Why? That lightning will hurt its foes.",
            "The finding comes from a years-long study in Panama\u2019s Barro Colorado Nature Monument. Using drones, an array of cameras and ground teams, scientists studied lightning\u2019s overall impact on local trees.",
            "The group expected the zaps would harm trees \u2014 always. But it soon became clear that one species got a boost. The occasional shock therapy tended to fend off rival trees. The high-energy bolts also killed off potentially parasitic vines, known as lianas, that could have strangled an almendro.",
            "Indeed, the competitive advantage from these strikes increased the reproductive success of those trees by 14 times.",
            "Researchers shared their new findings in the May New Phytologist.",
            "Study leader Evan Gora works at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y. This forest ecologist recalls just when the idea of a link between lightning and the almendros\u2019 success first hit him. It was after an especially powerful 2019 lightning bolt. After it struck one of these trees \u2014 it \u201clooked like a bomb went off,\u201d he says.",
            "The zap damaged an amazing number of surrounding trees, too \u2014 115 in all. Half of those died within two years. So did every liana vine that had covered the zapped almendro.",

            "fCAn almendro (Dipteryx oleifera) tree, seen immediately after a 2019 lightning strike (left), and then two years later (right). The powerful zap effectively pruned away parasitic vines. It also killed competing trees. This would ultimately benefit the lightning-struck tree.",
            "And the tree that was struck? It survived unscathed. It remained tall and healthy even as lightning had removed its direct competitors.",
            "Afterward, Gora recruited a team to investigate his hypothesis of a lightning benefit for some trees.",
            "This group documented the fate of 93 trees hit by lightning. Among them were nine almendros. After two years, every zapped almendro tree was doing fine, Gora reports. In fact, they were thriving. But 56 percent of the other species that had been hit are now dead.",
            "Apart from a few ruffled leaves, almendros aren\u2019t hurt by lightning. The electric shock, however, will fry most of the lianas growing up them.",
            "These vines sprout everywhere throughout the jungle. And they pose a real threat to trees. At a minimum, they cut off light to the trees that they ascend. They also can steal nutrients from large trees.",
            "And a liana may not climb just one tree. It can send up vines that connect to branches on neighboring trees. So if lightning strikes an almendro, the deadly current can spread through lianas to a host of neighboring trees.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "This fallout from lightning can free up space, light and nutrients for an almendro. On average, about nine nearby trees were killed by each almendro strike.",
            "In fact, growing next to an almendro truly seems hazardous to its neighbors since the new data suggest almendros actively attract lightning. How? They tend to grow taller than their neighbors. Their upper canopy also grows wider than that on other trees. In the end, this makes an almendro 68 percent more likely to be struck by lightning.",
            "One almendro tree was struck twice in five years, Gora\u2019s group found. His team now estimates that the typical tree will be struck an average of five times over its 300-year average lifespan.",
            "Connecting the dots between lightning and the pruning of almendro competitors was not easy. It required the right tools and surveys over a long time.",
            "\u201cA lightning strike lasts a few milliseconds,\u201d Gora notes. \u201cThen it takes months for the trees and lianas to die.\u201d So it can be hard to establish the full impacts, he says, \u201cunless you happen to be tracking the lightning strikes.\u201d",
            "Still a mystery: Why doesn\u2019t lightning kill almendros?",
            "One possibility is that the tree\u2019s wood has low electrical resistance. That might let it safely conduct current to the ground without suffering an excessive buildup of heat. Another hypothesis: The structure of the tree\u2019s crown may direct electricity away from the trunk \u2014 and toward its neighbors.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult\u201d to understand all the biological and physical steps that take place when lightning hits trees, says Bianca Zoletto. \u201cIt would be fascinating to be able to say something more on that,\u201d this ecologist notes. But for now, she points out, \u201cthat goes a bit more in the physics side, rather than the ecological side, of the study.\u201d",
            "Zoletto, who works at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands, didn\u2019t take part in new study. But she, too, has been studying how lightning and other high-voltage electrical phenomena affect tropical forests. And, she now stresses, recruiting the help of physicists could help biologists uncover what happens when a tree is struck by lightning. They\u2019re all curious how the almendro avoids getting fried by each thunderous zap."

            "The results turned up less microbial diversity on the space station than in typical buildings on Earth. Nearly all the ISS microbes were from people and building materials.

In people, that diversity helps to limit health problems. Some hospitals with low microbial diversity show a higher risk of infections. Microbes in your home can affect health, too. Amish communities have a lower risk of asthma than other similar groups. One reason could be that their house dust contains microbes from farm animals.",

They\u2019re essentially reflecting back upon us our own microbial diversity,\u201d he says.",
            "The low diversity of microbes in confined spaces is a growing concern for astronauts. That\u2019s especially true as they spend more time on space stations and new missions launch. We need to test ways of adding more \u201cgood germs\u201d to the mix, says Pieter Dorrestein. He\u2019s a chemical biologist at the University of California, San Diego.

            "We may not often see it, but all plants are on the move.",
            "Plants move in slow motion as they grow. Their roots sense gravity to stretch down into soil. This is known as gravitropism. Roots\u2019 ability to sense moisture also helps them bend toward water \u2014 a power called hydrotropism. And plant shoots grow up and out in the direction of sunlight. This sun-chasing strategy is phototropism.",
            "But growth isn\u2019t the only type of movement plants boast. Some plants are superfast. Perhaps the most famous is the Venus flytrap. When insects touch the hairlike triggers on its leaves, those leaves can snap shut in less than half a second.\u00a0",
            "Other plants trap prey much faster. Take underwater bladderworts. Their stalks are studded with sack-shaped traps. When a mosquito larva or some other prey triggers the hairs at a trap\u2019s lid, it opens. Water gets sucked in, pulling the prey with it, and the lid shuts. It all happens in one-thousandth of a second.",
            "Not all plants move to catch prey. Others do it to blast their seeds, spores or pollen into the air. The bunchberry dogwood is a good example. Its flowers have fused petals that hold down armlike stamens loaded with pollen. When disturbed, those petals split and the stamens flip outward to catapult pollen into the air. The stamens\u2019 acceleration is about 2,400 times that of Earth\u2019s gravity.",
            "The hairyflower wild petunia likewise flings its seeds into the air. Each of its seed pods contains seeds held in place by hooks.

That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface.

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Shahzeen Attari (seen here with her dog Savannah) draws on her personal experiences and interests to explore how science communicators can motivate others to save energy and fight climate change.",
            "Talking about climate change, energy and\nconservation is tough. The science can seem complex. So people need to\ncommunicate information clearly. Even when they do that, their audience does not\nalways listen. Biases, attitudes and experiences can color their perceptions. Even\nwhen people do listen, they may not believe what they hear or want to make\nchanges in their own lives.",
            "Shahzeen Attari studies how people respond to\ninformation about climate change. As a scientist at Indiana University\nBloomington, she also explores other aspects of how people choose to use energy,\nwater and other resources. Her work is interdisciplinary research. In her case,\nit involves multiple fields of psychology, engineering and environmental\nscience. ",
            "Attari was born in Mumbai, India. She grew up,\nhowever, in Dubai. It is part of the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East. She\ncame to the United States as a college student and has lived there since then. In\nthis interview, Attari shares her experiences and advice with Science News for Students. (This\ninterview has been edited for content and readability.)",
            "Growing up in Dubai, I saw how a desert was\nquickly transformed into a metropolis, or major city. This happened over a very\nshort time span of about 10 years. So I realized growing up that humans have a\nvery strong and direct impact that can transform nature. ",
            "In college, I volunteered for the Nature\nConservancy during one spring break. I realized the natural environment is\nbeautiful and magical. I wanted to understand how to protect nature. ",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "I also worked in interdisciplinary science labs\nin college. They basically combine different fields of research to answer\nquestions that sit in the middle of those fields. That gave me a thirst and\nlove for interdisciplinary research. ",
            "All these things changed the way I thought about\nproblems. Since then, I\u2019ve been working systematically, trying to understand\nhow people think about climate change and the actions needed to address the\nproblem. And I want to know how we can effectively communicate with people about\nthose topics.",
            "I studied physics and math in my college engineering program. That was at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In graduate school I studied engineering and public policy and civil and environmental engineering. I went to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa. For my PhD thesis, I studied how people perceive how much energy and water their appliances use.",
            "There have been challenges. In general, people\nat universities have preferred research that fits into clean, distinct buckets.\nMy research just does not do that. So, I have had to look for places that\nnurture interdisciplinary research. And it\u2019s hard to work in multiple fields.\nYou have to learn about and gather all the expertise across those fields. Then\nyou need to use that knowledge to solve a problem. That has been really\nchallenging.",
            "Also, women and people of color at universities\ncan experience sexism and racism, based on who we are. But I\u2019ve been blessed with\namazing mentors and institutions that nurture diversity. ",
            "At times, I felt I had to be very careful about\nwhat I did. Dubai is not a completely free state. (Some people in the United\nArab Emirates have been arrested for criticizing the government, for example. And\nwomen have fewer legal privileges than men.) And in the United States, I was an\nimmigrant. I didn\u2019t have citizenship rights until I finally became a citizen,\nlast December. By then I had lived in the United States for about 20 years.",
            "Now, there\u2019s this freeing sense of becoming more\nof a scientist and an activist at the same time. There are some scientists who\njust want to be scientists. I think that needs to change. More scientists need to\nplay a role in communicating with the public and policy makers. We need this\nmost of all in areas like climate change.",
            "Inspiration for almost all of the projects I\u2019ve\nworked on has come from personal challenges and experiences. A lot of it starts\nfrom my own curiosity to understand what\u2019s going on with a problem. ",
            "As a PhD student, I knew about physics. But even\nwith my training, it was hard for me to quickly understand how much energy\ndifferent appliances and actions used. I wondered how other people think about\nthat. That became my PhD research. ",
            "Then I went to talk about that research at a\nconference. Someone in the audience stood up. \u201cHey, you just flew [on an energy-guzzling\nairplane] to this meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to listen to anything you\nhave to say.\u201d That was really interesting to me. Why didn\u2019t he want to listen\nto what I had to say? That led to another series of papers. I wanted to\nunderstand how scientists\u2019 behaviors affect how people judge them.",
            "I\u2019m very proud of the papers that grew out of\nthe challenge at that conference. I worked on them with Dave Krantz and Elke\nWeber at Columbia University. People judge researchers on our energy\nfootprints, we learned. What we do in our personal lives affects how effective\nour communication is. ",
            "We found that scientists who have a bigger \u201ccarbon\nfootprint\u201d for home energy use are less likely to change people\u2019s beliefs and behaviors.\nPeople are also less likely to support policies to cut carbon emissions if the\nscientist telling them about the policy has a high carbon footprint. ",
            "I\u2019m not the type of scientist that just wants to\ndo science for science\u2019s sake. I want to do science that has broader impacts\nand that makes a positive change. But I do not feel like my research has helped\nenough with the problem of climate change. Sometimes I feel like I need to do so\nmuch more. I\u2019ve had to work on not taking these failures personally.",
            "I go on really long hikes with my dog, Savannah.\nShe\u2019s a hound dog from a shelter. She just flies through the woods, and she has\na knack for finding timber rattlesnakes. ",
            "*Shahzeen_Attari",
            "fCShahzeen Attari loves to go hiking and loves reading sci-fi. Her interest in futuristic fiction inspired a new project to see how people can imagine the future and what it would take to achieve that world.",
            "I also love reading science fiction. A lot of these\nstories talk about the future and time travel and different societies. I love\ngetting lost in the fantasy of these different worlds. They help us reimagine\nwhat our world could look like. So now I\u2019ve started a whole new line of\nresearch, trying to get people to think about the future. What do they want the\nfuture to look like? And what are the pathways of getting there?",
            "I wish someone had told me that failure is okay.\nAs researchers, we get rejected all the time \u2014 from getting grants, publishing\npapers, working on projects and more. Every time you fail, you just have to\npick yourself up and start running again.",
            "I learned this through my mentors in college:\nFollow the questions you want answered, based on your background and personal interests.\nAs a scientist, you can go a really long way talking to people and learning\nfrom people. And if something is not in your tool basket, learn from people\naround you who know about those tools. ",

            "Climate change can seem like a problem too big for any one person to bother tackling. But that doesn\u2019t mean that people are just sitting on the sidelines waiting for the inevitable. There are kids who have sued the U.S. government. More than a million students and other people worldwide took to the streets in a one-day strike on behalf of the climate. And scientists, of course, do research to help inform the public about what\u2019s happening to the world around us.",
            "Many of those scientists could use some help. And sometimes they don\u2019t need scientific experts.\u00a0Average citizens can\u00a0supply what they need. Experts refer to these helpers as citizen scientists.",

And she runs one of these many projects. Called MeadoWatch, it focuses on a phenomenon called phenology (Feh-NOLL-uh-gee). This term refers to the fact that the timing of many life events, such as when flowers bloom, is seasonal. Scientists want to know if that timing is changing as the planet warms.",
            "But research into other, non-climate-related areas of conservation also can help, says Hille Ris Lambers. That\u2019s because climate change often isn\u2019t the only type of stress that organisms have to deal with. There are other factors, ranging from the illegal wildlife trade to overfishing and pollution. If scientists can figure out how to eliminate those other factors, then species should have a better chance of being able to deal with climate change.",

Volunteers collect data along hiking trails about when wildflowers bud, flower, fruit and produce seed. The project is also collecting photos of wildflowers from across Mount Rainier National Park.",
            "For four days every February, volunteers around the world count birds in 15-minute sprints. These observations can be made anywhere, including your own backyard. The counts provide scientists snapshots of data on where birds are found, and how many there are. Since the count has been going on for more than 20 years, researchers can now answer questions about how these patterns may be changing with time. That includes how diseases and climate change may be affecting these populations.",
            "People have collected weather data for a very long time. And many of these early weather records still exist. But for scientists to use them, data from handwritten, paper records need to be digitized \u2014 entered into a computer. This is usually not something that a computer can do well on its own. With Weather Rescue, British researchers are using online volunteers to transcribe daily measurements that were taken in Europe starting in the 1860s. That was before temperatures began to rise because of global warming. These data will provide a useful baseline for future research.",
            "Residents of Minnesota can sign up to be a volunteer water monitor for the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. Volunteers are assigned a lake or stream. Twice a month during the summer, they take measurements of water clarity. Those data let the government see whether water clarity has been changing over time as well as assess the health of those waterways.\u00a0",
            "Gretta Pecl is a marine ecologist in Australia at the University of Tasmania in Hobart. She studies where marine species are moving in response to climate change. She set up a program called Redmap. It asks people to report \u201cuncommon\u201d marine species that they\u2019ve seen in Australian waters. \u201cWe wanted to have an early indication of what species were moving where they live,\u201d she explains. But the program also helps when she is talking to the public about climate change. \u201cI think it\u2019s a more powerful conversation, if you can start off from the point of view of what other people are bringing to the table.\u201d"

These gentler movements may have been part of a play session, researchers report.",

A behavioral ecologist and geneticist, he headed the research team. His group shared its new findings February 28 in Frontiers in Marine Science.",
            "A narwhal\u2019s tusk is an elongated, spiraled tooth. It protrudes from the top lip of males (and some females). Males can grow to 5 meters (16 feet) long, with their tusks spanning another half their body length.",

            "Another recording showed three narwhals following a large char, with one whale taking the lead. It lightly nudged and flipped the fish with the tip or side of its tusk. In this way, it altered the fish\u2019s path. There\u2019s little evidence that narwhals normally eat much char. And winter, not summer, is their big dining season. So this video seems to show the whale and fish investigating one another.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s this tentativeness,\u201d O\u2019Corry-Crowe explains. Then, he notes, the char \u201cmakes a dramatic movement.\u201d Afterward, the whale \u201cjust recoils and goes whoa!\u201d",

            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

            "It\u2019s the day of a big test. Your heart is pounding. Your palms are sweating. Your breathing quickens and your stomach suddenly feels full of butterflies. Although these stress responses may not feel good, they are totally normal. They\u2019re your body\u2019s way of sharpening your focus and boosting the energy you have to help you perform well.\u00a0",
            "When we encounter a big challenge or risk \u2014 or become overly excited \u2014 our body responds in a way to keep us safe. We\u2019re hardwired for this. These changes supercharge how our body functions.",
            "An increased heart rate and breathing will send more oxygen to our muscles and brain. Our muscles tense so they can react quickly. By sweating, our body attempts to avoid overheating. Our pupils enlarge so we become more aware of our surroundings. And our body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, to boost our energy and focus.",
            "Together, these changes are known as the fight-or-flight response. They\u2019re automatically triggered by what\u2019s known as the sympathetic nervous system. It helps us respond to danger or challenges. They give us more power, more speed and agility. All are important for physical activity, says Katharine Meddles. She\u2019s a neurologist for children in Denver, Colo.\u00a0",
            "This survival mechanism helped our ancient hunter-gatherer ancestors fight or escape from a wild animal \u2014 perhaps a saber-toothed tiger. Today, we face very different risks than people did 300,000 years ago. But our sympathetic nervous system remains very important to our making it through challenging events.",
            "It turns on when we play sports, perform or catch ourselves from falling. It motivates us to study or concentrate on difficult tasks. And it turns on when we\u2019re trying something new or talking to someone we like. Activating that fight-or-flight response in short bursts is healthy.",

            "Here, our heart rate and breathing become slow and steady. Our muscles relax. Stress hormone levels lower, and feel-good hormones \u2014 such as oxytocin and serotonin \u2014 become somewhat higher. This lets us feel safe. We now can think calmly, digest food and sleep, all processes vital to our brain and overall health, notes Meddles.\u00a0",

            "The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems keep our bodies in balance. Together, they make up the autonomic nervous system. By switching us between rest and action, they work together to help us respond appropriately to the range of situations we experience.\u00a0",

            "Our world is full of threats. For example, the erratic impacts of climate change not only are hard to predict but also can pose true threats. Social media can pressure us to live or act a certain way. And parents can pressure us to perform well in a competitive environment.",
            "Encountering such conditions may keep your body stuck in fight-or-flight mode.",
            "Worrying about things is not a failing or a shortcoming, says Meddles. \u201cIt\u2019s natural\u201d and reflects \u201cthe way that our brains are wired.\u201d\u00a0But too much anxiety can leave you overwhelmed and unable to perform well.",

When those organisms die, their remains sink and can either dissolve into deep sea waters or settle into the seafloor. Carbon locked up underground can also be violently blasted back out into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions.",

            "Since the 1950s, people have reported strange balls of light floating down a road along old railroad tracks near Summerville, S.C. These spooky shimmers are known as the Summerville Light. Local lore says a grieving ghost\u2019s lantern is behind the glow.",

Sunlight spans the whole light spectrum \u2014 from long-wavelength radio waves to short-wavelength X-rays. The part we can see makes up a small chunk in the middle. This is known as the visible spectrum. ",
            "Within the visible spectrum, the way we perceive light\u2019s color relates to how our eyes work.",
            "Our eyes have three types of cone cells. S cones respond most strongly to blues and other short wavelengths of light. M cones respond most to mid-wavelength light, such as green. Those that respond mostly to reddish hues are the L cones. Our brain processes data coming from all three types of cones to perceive color.",
            "When there\u2019s light coming from all the different colors of the rainbow, we perceive that as white light. And if our eyes could see the whole mix of the sun\u2019s visible wavelengths, it would tend to appear white. So why does the sun generally seem yellow?",

Light with longer wavelengths \u2014 such as red, yellow and orange \u2014 will pass through the atmosphere to reach our eyes. This is why the sky looks blue and the sun looks mostly orange, yellow or red. (The exact hue depends on atmospheric conditions, including cloud cover.)",

The effect depends on the light\u2019s wavelength. Shorter blue and green wavelengths scatter much more than longer yellow and red hues. This affects what color the sun appears to us.",
            "If we could observe the sun without Earth\u2019s atmosphere, then would it look green?",

            "Scientists have finally observed plastic ice (illustrated), a phase between solid ice and liquid water. Plastic ice may form in the interiors of icy worlds, such as Neptune or Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.",
            "A strange type of ice has just been observed.",
            "It forms at high temperatures and pressures. It possesses traits of both solid ice and liquid water. And researchers have now directly observed it for the first time. They described their findings February 12 in Nature. What they observed may also help scientists better understand worlds beyond Earth.",
            "Plastic ice is \u201csomething intermediate between a liquid and a crystal,\u201d explains Livia Bove. She\u2019s a physicist at CNRS in Paris. \u201cYou can imagine that it is softer when you squeeze it.\u201d It\u2019s called plastic ice because it is more easily molded or deformed than typical crystalline ice. Scientists refer to this Play-Doh-like trait as plasticity.",
            "Explains Bove, it\u2019s \u201clike something that can [squeeze] through a hole and come out, even if it\u2019s still solid.\u201d",
            "The molecules that make up ordinary ice sit in a hexagonal, honeycomb-like shape. Ice cubes, glaciers and snow contain this type of ice. It\u2019s formally known as ice Ih.",
            "In addition to Ih, there are at least 20 other known ice phases. They form under different conditions of pressure and temperature.",
            "At pressures above about 20,000 kilograms per square centimeter (285,466 pounds per square inch), ice smooshes into what\u2019s known as ice VII. It\u2019s densely packed molecules are ordered like the cubies in a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Ice VII has been found trapped in diamonds from Earth\u2019s mantle. It\u2019s also thought to occur inside other planets.\u00a0",
            "Some ice phases exist only in theory. They\u2019ve never been seen.",
            "More than 15 years ago, computer models predicted what would happen if ice VII were heated and put under extreme pressure. As in a liquid, its individual water molecules should start to rotate freely. Yet those molecules also should stay in one place \u2014 as in a solid.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Since this simulated phase shared the same cubic crystal structure as ice VII, it became known as plastic ice VII. But scientists didn\u2019t know whether it truly existed. Running tests at such high pressures wasn\u2019t possible, back then.",
            "For the new study, Bove was part of a team that used a relatively new tool. It can measure the motions of molecules under extreme pressures. It does this by shooting them with tiny particles called neutrons.",
            "Those neutrons interact with molecules in their samples. Depending on the molecules\u2019 motion, the neutrons gain or lose energy \u2014 then scatter away toward a detector. Measuring the scattered neutrons\u2019 energies allowed Bove\u2019s team to figure out how the ice molecules moved. From this, they could identify the ice phase that had formed.",
            "Above 177\u00b0 Celsius (350\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and at a pressure about 28 times that of the deepest point in Earth\u2019s oceans, Bove\u2019s team observed plastic ice VII. As expected, its structure formed a cubic-crystal lattice. And its molecules rotated about as fast as those in liquid water.",
            "*Animations_show_water_molecules_moving_around_in_the_liquid_state,_vibrating_in_place_in_the_solid_s",
            "fCIn liquid water, individual molecules can freely move about and rotate, while in solid ice they can only vibrate in place. In plastic ice, water molecules are held in place but still are able to rotate.",
            "However, one detail differed from what had been predicted. Rather than revolve freely, plastic ice VII\u2019s molecules appeared to swivel in jerky motions. As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux. He\u2019s a planetary scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Plastic ice VII could have formed then because water hadn\u2019t escaped yet from those moons\u2019 high-pressure interiors, he explains.",
            "The new observations could help researchers piece together the story of how these moons changed over time, he says.",
            "And beyond our solar system, the strange ice may be found on the bottom of super deep oceans on exoplanets. Scientists think plastic ice may cover the seafloors of their oceans.",
            "It would be interesting to find out whether seafloor nutrients could move through plastic ice and into the oceans above, Journaux says. \u201cThat would actually feed the ocean with more nutrients.\u201d And those nutrients could make the oceans more habitable, he says.",
