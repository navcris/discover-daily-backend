            "Growing up, Roberto S. Luciani had hints that his brain worked differently than most people\u2019s. He\u2019d hear people talk about how they pictured what a character from a book should look like, for instance. He couldn\u2019t relate to what they meant.",
            "But it wasn\u2019t until he was a teenager that things finally clicked. His mother had just woken up and was telling him about a dream she had. \u201cMovielike,\u201d is how she described it.",
            "\u201cUp until then, I assumed that cartoon depictions of imagination were exaggerated,\u201d Luciani says. \u201cI asked her what she meant and quickly realized my visual imagery was not functioning like hers.\u201d",
            "He has a condition called aphantasia (AY-fan-TAY-zhee-uh). This is an inability to picture objects, people and scenes in one\u2019s mind. When Luciani was growing up, the term didn\u2019t even exist. Now he studies the condition as a cognitive scientist at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and other scientists are getting a clearer picture of how some brains work, including those with a blind mind\u2019s eye.",
            "In a recent study, Luciani and colleagues explored how our senses interact. In this case, they focused on hearing and seeing. In most people\u2019s brains, these two senses work together. Sound information affects activity in brain areas that handle vision. But in people with aphantasia, this connection isn\u2019t as strong. The team reported this November 4 in Current Biology.",

            "The researchers recruited people to lay in a brain scanner, blindfolded. The volunteers listened to three sound scenes: A forest full of birds, a crowd of people and a street bustling with traffic.",
            "In 10 people without aphantasia, these soundscapes kicked off activity in the brain\u2019s visual system. It was as if the sounds led them to form a mental image. But in 23 people with aphantasia, these patterns were weaker.",
            "The results show that senses can be linked within the brain to varying degrees, says Lars Muckli. He\u2019s also a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Glasgow.",

            "At one end of the range are people with synesthesia, he says. In this condition, sounds and sights are tightly mingled. For instance, someone with synesthesia might hear music as shapes or associate letter sounds with certain colors.",
            "\u201cIn the midrange, you experience the mind\u2019s eye,\u201d Muckli says. Perhaps sounds trigger images in your mind, even though you know the pictures aren\u2019t real.",

            "The study results help explain how brains of people with and without aphantasia differ, Muckli says. They also give clues about how our brains work in general. \u201cThe senses of the brain are more interconnected than our textbooks tell us.\u201d",
            "The findings also highlight how people can make sense of the world in very different ways. Aphantasia \u201cexists in a realm of invisible differences between people that make our lived experiences unique, without us realizing,\u201d Luciani says. \u201cI find it fascinating that there may be other differences lurking in the shadow of us assuming other people experience the world like us.\u201d",

            "To understand where purple comes from, we need to know how our eyes and brain work together to perceive color. And that all begins with light.",
            "Light is another term for electromagnetic radiation. Most comes from the sun and travels to Earth in waves. There are many different types of light, which scientists group based on the lengths of those waves. (The wavelength is the distance between one wave peak and the next.) Together, all of those wavelengths make up the electromagnetic spectrum.",

            "fCLight moves its energy in waves (illustrated by blue line) that move up and down. This creates high points called crests and low points called troughs. Light varies in terms of the length of its waves (called wavelength), which is measured as the distance from one crest to another or one trough to another.",
            "Our eyes can\u2019t see most wavelengths, such as the microwaves used to cook food or the ultraviolet light that can burn our skin when we don\u2019t wear sunscreen. We can directly see only a teeny, tiny sliver of the spectrum \u2014 just 0.0035 percent! This slice is known as the visible-light spectrum. It spans wavelengths between roughly 350 and 700 nanometers.",
            "The acronym ROYGBIV (pronounced Roy-gee-biv) can be used to remember the order of colors in that visible spectrum: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. You can see these colors in a rainbow stretching across the sky after a rainstorm or when light shines through a prism. In the visible spectrum, red light has the longest wavelength. Blue and violet are the shortest. Green and yellow sit toward the middle.",
            "Although violet is in the visible spectrum, purple is not. Indeed, violet and purple are not the same color. They look similar, but the way our brain perceives them is very different.",

            "Color perception starts in our eyes. The backs of our eyes contain light-sensitive cells called cones. Most people have three types. They\u2019re sometimes called red, green and blue cones because each is most sensitive to one of those colors.",
            "But cones don\u2019t \u201csee\u201d color, notes Zab Johnson. Instead, they detect certain wavelengths of light.",
            "Johnson works at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She and other scientists who study how we perceive color prefer to classify cones based on the range of wavelengths they detect: long, mid or short.",

Our eyes have fewer cones, which are sensitive to color. The pigment epithelium is a layer of dark cells under the photoreceptors. They absorb excess light.",
            "When light enters our eyes, the specific combination of cones it activates is like a code. Our brain deciphers that code and then translates it into a color. ",
            "Consider light that stimulates long- and mid-wavelength cones but few, if any, short-wavelength cones. Our brain interprets this as orange. When light triggers mostly short-wavelength cones, we see blue or violet. A combination of mid- and short-wavelength cones looks green. Any color within the visible rainbow can be created by a single wavelength of light stimulating a specific combination of cones.",

            "Notice that the visible spectrum is a gradient. One color gradually shifts into the next. The activity of cones activated by the light also gradually shifts from one type to the next. At the red end of the spectrum, for instance, long-wavelength cones do most of the work. As you move from red to orange, the mid-wavelength cones help more and the long-wavelength cones do less.",
            "In the middle of the rainbow \u2014 colors like green and yellow \u2014 the mid-wavelength cones are busiest, with help from both long- and short-wavelength cones. At the blue end of the spectrum, short-wavelength cones do most of the work.",

            "This makes purple a puzzle.",
            "Purple is a mix of red (long) and blue (short) wavelengths. Seeing something that\u2019s purple, such as eggplants or lilacs, stimulates both short- and long-wavelength cones. This confuses the brain. If long-wavelength cones are excited, the color should be red or near to that. If short-wavelength cones are excited, the color should be near to blue.",
            "The problem: Those colors are on opposite ends of the spectrum. How can a color be close to both ends at once?",
            "To cope, the brain improvises. It takes the visible spectrum \u2014 usually a straight line \u2014 and bends it\u00a0into a circle. This puts blue and red next to each other.",

            "Colors that are part of the visible spectrum are known as spectral colors. It only takes one wavelength of light for our brain to perceive shades of each color. Purple, however, is a nonspectral color. That means it\u2019s made of two wavelengths of light (one long and one short).",

That means it will gradually decay into an isotope of nitrogen.",

After about 50,000 years, so little carbon-14 remains in any sample that this element can\u2019t be used to date the material.

            "Microbiologist Max Schubert led the team that found Chonkus. At the time, he worked in Cambridge, Mass., for the Wyss Institute at Harvard University.

            "Here, Schubert\u2019s team expected to find microbes that take in carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. But they never expected to find anything quite like this naturally occurring mutant strain of\u00a0Synechococcus elongatus. That\u2019s a\u00a0species of cyanobacterium, a type that performs photosynthesis. S. elongatus\u00a0is known for growing fast. It also withstands a wide range of conditions.",
            "Chonkus is like a superpowered version of the microbe.",
            "When Schubert\u2019s team grew it in the lab, individual Chonkus cells were larger than those of other fast-growing cyanobacteria. Its cells also built larger colonies.",
            "What\u2019s more, Chonkus stored more carbon than other strains of\u00a0S. elongatus. It seemed to pack it away within white granules in its cells.",
            "Chonkus also proved heavier than its relatives. When placed into a test tube, its cells sank quickly to the bottom, forming a dense sludge.",
            "The researchers shared these findings October 29 in\u00a0Applied and Environmental Microbiology.",
            "Chonkus\u2019 traits could make it very useful for pulling climate-warming carbon out of the air and storing it in or near the ocean floor. In fact, its cells might be able to absorb a lot more carbon than the ocean\u2019s average cyanobacteria. And since they sink so fast, they could quickly remove carbon from air above the water.",
            "The discovery of Chonkus suggests that ocean-floor seeps that emit lots of carbon dioxide may hold other rare and useful organisms. Maybe even other life forms that could help store carbon in the ocean. When it comes to curbing the worst effects of climate change, such organisms may be tiny but mighty superheroes."

This produces\u00a0melanin, the same dark brown pigment that colors human hair, skin and eyes. The\u00a0enzyme\u00a0responsible for the browning is called\u00a0polyphenol oxidase (or PPO). In the presence of\u00a0oxygen, the PPO enzyme changes substances known as phenolic compounds (through a process of\u00a0oxidation) into different compounds called\u00a0quinones. The quinones then react with other compounds to form\u00a0melanin. Melanin is what turns the fruit and vegetables brown.",

            "Discover enzymes at work and find out how they turn some fruits brown in this fun science activity!",
            "This reaction, however, usually does not happen within fresh fruits and vegetables because the PPO and the phenolic compounds are separated in plant cells.",
            "The enzymatic browning process is only triggered when PPO, phenolic compounds and oxygen come in contact with each other. This is exactly what happens when a fruit is cut, falls or is knocked around too much. When fruit tissue is damaged due to heat, cold, age or mechanical stress, its cells break open and the phenolic compounds and the enzyme are released and mix with oxygen in the air. As a result, the damaged tissue turns brown almost immediately.",
            "In the food industry, lots of attempts have been made to prevent enzymatic browning and keep produce appearing fresh for a long time. One example is the development of the Arctic apple. This apple was modified so that it no longer produces the PPO enzyme. With no enzyme present, the browning reaction cannot occur.",
            "Another solution is to treat the produce in a specific way to inhibit the enzyme, slowing the browning reaction. Enzymes can only work in certain environments. Most cannot function if it gets too cold or too warm, and they do not usually like acidic conditions. In this project, you will apply different liquids to apple slices to see which one works best to keep your apples nice and fresh.",

But since Percy\u00a0landed in Jezero Crater three years ago, scientists have struggled to identify organics, Stack Morgan says. That landing site was an ancient, dried-up lake.",
            "Adding to the new excitement, little white spots with black rims speckle the reddish rock sample that Percy found. \u201cThey look like a tricolored leopard spot,\u201d Stack Morgan says.",

A big part of Percy\u2019s mission is to collect samples from interesting rocks for a future spacecraft to later bring home to Earth. Once here, they can be studied with better tools than a rover can carry on its back. For now, Stack Morgan says, Percy has thrown everything it has at this rock.",
            "When might the rocks be brought to Earth? No one knows.

The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock.

Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",

But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed.

            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

But many common biology textbooks present overly simple science on sex and gender, which may contribute to sexism \u2014 and prejudice against anyone who doesn\u2019t seem to represent typical gender norms.",
            "Major textbooks used by most introductory biology classes in U.S. high schools contain overly simplistic \u2014 and misleading \u2014 language when describing sex and gender. That\u2019s the finding of a new study.",
            "The study authors worry that such faulty teaching may be used to justify sexism or prejudice against certain segments of society.",
            "Brian Donovan is an education researcher at BSCS Science Learning. It\u2019s in Colorado Springs, Colo. The center develops materials for classrooms and teachers. It also evaluates how science and technology are taught. Donovan\u2019s team looked at six widely used high-school biology textbooks. Nationwide, about two out of every three intro classes in biology use one of these texts.",
            "The researchers scoured each book, looking for passages that dealt with biological sex and gender. In all, they found 362 paragraphs in genetics chapters that dealt with these topics. And in each book, at least some passages erred in how they described sex or gender. The study also turned up problems with how the books taught about traits linked to genes.",

            "How such topics are presented can affect students\u2019 beliefs about who\u2019s good at science, Donovan has found. Back in 2019, his team randomly assigned 460 eighth to tenth graders to read one of three genetics passages. The readings differed in how they described what role genes play in differences between sexes. Later, the team surveyed these kids about why they think some people are good at science.",
            "Some of the readings gave an oversimplified version of how genes determine differences between sexes. For example, they described basic genetic differences between men and women based on X- and Y-chromosomes. Students who read these passages were more likely to think that someone\u2019s academic ability was set by genes, too. Such thinking could lead to false beliefs that males and females have different abilities in some fields. This includes success in STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and math.",

            "What\u2019s more, these ideas seemed to affect girls\u2019 views about themselves. Many of those who read the overly simplistic lessons showed less interest in pursuing careers in science-related fields, compared with girls who had gotten other information.",
            "These results are important because gender stereotypes start young. Sexist attitudes about how smart someone is \u2014 including oneself \u2014 can begin by first grade. A limited understanding of biology might support those attitudes. And it could help explain why fewer women seek careers in science and engineering.",
            "The researchers found that the textbooks tended to focus on so-called \u201ceither/or\u201d traits. These are discrete traits that you either have or you don\u2019t. But such traits are actually rare. Some textbooks describe being able to roll your tongue as a discrete trait. It\u2019s not. Some of us can roll our tongues a lot. Others can barely do it. The rest fall somewhere in between.\u00a0\u00a0",

But there are also millions of people whose bodies are not strictly male or female. These people are referred to as being intersex. There was no mention of intersex individuals in any of the books reviewed for the new study.",
            "A mixture of genetics and the environment can influence people\u2019s traits. For instance, exposure in utero to some foods and pollutants can mimic sex hormones. That can affect whether people (and animals) develop certain feminine or masculine features.",

            "Females usually have two X-chromosomes; males usually have an X- and a Y-chromosome. However, chromosomes and genitals do not set our gender. Gender is different than sex, points out Catherine Riegle-Crumb. She is a sociologist at the University of Texas at Austin and one of the new study\u2019s authors. A transgender male, for example, might have two X-chromosomes, but his gender is still male.",
            "\u201cGender has to do with our beliefs and ideas about males and females,\u201d explains Riegle-Crumb. We inherit gender from our culture. What is considered normal behavior and preferences for males, females or nonbinary people varies between cultures. It also can change over time.",
            "These expectations \u2014 called gender norms \u2014 affect how society treats people. And it starts even before a baby is born. (Think \u201cgender reveal\u201d parties: pink for females, blue for males.)",
            "Yet in the new study, none of the 362 paragraphs on such topics described the difference between sex and gender. And if students don\u2019t learn the difference, Riegle-Crumb worries, they may assume gender differences are due to sex. It can also make it harder for students to accept transgender people, whose gender doesn\u2019t match the sex they were assigned at birth.",
            "Assumptions could lead students to use genes to explain other differences they see, too. For example, social differences. Why aren\u2019t there more women leaders? The answer is not found in their genes. Still, students may think it is.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The studied books also left out the many ways men and women are similar, Riegle-Crumb notes. Nor did they describe the normal range of differences between people within a group. For example, some men have more feminine features. Some women have more masculine ones.",
            "The books focused instead on the traits women tend to share with women, or men with men.\u00a0 This gives the impression that all women are kind of the same (and so are men).",
            "These books explained differences between people largely on the basis of genes. They gave gene-based reasons 12 times as often as external-factor reasons. External factors include what society expects of us or how our genes may interact with the environment. In fact, genes alone don\u2019t explain most differences between people, Donovan\u2019s team points out.",
            "Nowhere did the books write that genders have different STEM abilities. But kids can come to that false conclusion, Donovan says. It\u2019s something his team saw in its 2019 study.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/kT0HJkr1jj4?feature=oembed",
            "This video explains, using science, why it\u2019s not only outdated but also wrong to think there are just two human sexes.",
            "The new study\u2019s findings are important \u2014 but not surprising, says Zach Schudson. He\u2019s a social psychologist at California State University in Sacramento. He did not take part in the new work. But he does study how beliefs about gender and our bodies can affect how we view ourselves and others.",
            "Says Schudson, the first time most of his students hear about intersex people is in a college class. The new study, he says, helps explain why. Not recognizing that many people won\u2019t fit squarely into a male or female category can lead to prejudice against those who seem different from norms, he says.",
            "These beliefs also can affect someone\u2019s views on gender equality. One 2018 study, for instance, showed that people who believe men and women have distinct capabilities based on their genes were less likely to support equal pay for women. People with such beliefs also may question whether women should be leaders, says Riegle-Crumb.",
            "One way to combat unscientific messaging is call it out, says Riegle-Crumb. People naturally exhibit a diverse range of traits. Don\u2019t try to fit everyone into a few simple boxes. Instead, she suggests, notice both the many traits people share and the ways we differ."

            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",

He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often."

As freezing water expands underground, it presses against nearby soil, and pressure builds.

            "Dickson Fjord in Northeast Greenland National Park. A catastrophic landslide occurred here last year. Rocks and ice plunging into the water triggered a tsunami \u2014 and then a standing wave called a seiche that rang Earth like a seismic bell for nine days. ",
            "A mountainside in Greenland collapsed catastrophically into the ocean, last year. The landslide triggered a wave as tall as the Statue of Liberty. This wave \u2014 a tsunami \u2014 swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down a fjord there. Its rapid and violent motion ripped up the coastline. And its vibrations were so violent that they were detected worldwide.",
            "Indeed, they rang the planet like a seismic bell every minute and a half \u2014 for nine straight days.",
            "The good news: No one was hurt. Large tourist ships ventured into that same fjord on the days before and after the tsunami. They were ferrying people on and off a beach with small boats, according to Kristian Svennevig.",
            "\u201cIt was pure luck that no one was there when it happened,\u201d he says. The powerful wave would have easily capsized the small boats and swept the people away.",
            "Svennevig is a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). He\u2019s based in Copenhagen, Denmark. He led a team that investigated the event. They now believe that Earth\u2019s warming climate set off the massive landslide that started it all. They described their findings September 13 in Science.",
            "Aside from those caused by earthquakes and volcanoes, \u201cmost landslides around the world you can tie to climatic factors,\u201d says Svennevig. And as Earth keeps warming, he worries, this dangerous event could be a warning of worse things to come.",
            "Saturday, September 16, 2023, started normally enough. But then at 11:35 a.m., sensors in Asia and North America picked up a sharp seismic signal. They detected waves rippling from a remote part of Greenland\u2019s east coast.",
            "Earthquakes typically cause such vibrations. But explosions, tsunamis and volcanoes can, too. Initially, the source here was unknown.",
            "The next day, tourists on a cruise ship noticed damage to an abandoned research station on east Greenland\u2019s Ella Island. Equipment that was stored on land, including a boat and a truck-size shipping container, had been washed into the sea.",
            "Svennevig heard these reports when he arrived at work Monday morning. Suspecting a tsunami, he looked through recent satellite images of the area. He hoped they would offer clues.",
            "And they did.",
            "For many kilometers along Dickson Fjord, vegetation had been erased from the shorelines. At Ella Island, the plants had vanished to heights as much as four meters (13 feet) above the water. Further west and inland, plants were missing to higher and higher coastal elevations.",
            "A huge wave must have come from the west, Svennevig realized. It would have started out tall and gradually shrunk as it rolled east.",
            "That afternoon, he and several colleagues homed in on its source.",
            "*a_satellite_image_of_the_landslide_location,_a_red_circle_indicates_location",

            "Two satellite photos taken September 15 and 17 showed that a small mountain ridge near the west end of the fjord had vanished.",
            "A frozen glacier had long sat at the foot of this ridge, some 72 kilometers (45 miles) from Ella Island. Somehow, the lower reaches of that glacier had been pulverized.",
            "The collapsed ridge had smashed down onto the glacier below. It released some 25 million cubic meters (880 million cubic feet) of rock and shattered ice. The volume of this debris was equal to 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This rock and ice tumbled off the end of the glacier and into the fjord\u2019s water.",
            "*a_composite_image_showing_a_mountain_ridge_and_the_glacier_topping_it_before_and_after_the_tsunami",
            "fCA mountain ridge overlooking this glacier in Greenland collapsed into a massive landslide. The tsunami it triggered swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down the fjord. Climate warming set off the disaster by causing the glacier to thin, which destabilized the mountain ridge that it had supported.",
            "The resulting splash threw water 200 meters (650 feet) up the nearby mountain slopes. The wave it triggered was 110 meters (360 feet) tall. It may have sped along the fjord at 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour or more!",
            "But there wasn\u2019t just a single wave.",
            "This explosive event provoked a repeating wave called a seiche (SAYSH). It resembled the back-and-forth sloshing of water in a bathtub. Except here it was way bigger \u2014 echoing through the fjord every 90 seconds for nine straight days.",
            "Though sudden, this catastrophe was caused by changes that have been slowly happening for decades. Earth\u2019s warming climate has shrunk the glacier by Dickson Fjord over time. No one knows how quickly it was losing ice. But other glaciers in this part of Greenland have thinned by as much as 150 meters (490 feet) since 1900. As the glaciers thinned, they laid bare the fragile mountain slopes that their ice had previously supported.",
            "And this appears to be why the ridge at Dickson Fjord collapsed, Svennevig says. It lost that icy support.",
            "He fears such disasters could become more common as Greenland and other Arctic sites warm.",
            "Since 2017, Svennevig has used satellite images to map more than 500 landslides along Greenland\u2019s coasts. Some happened thousands of years ago. Others crumbled as recently as 2021.",
            "In warmer parts of the world, heavy rains often trigger landslides. But a warming of permafrost caused many of the recent ones in Greenland. And here\u2019s how.",
            "As long as the temperature inside a mountain is no warmer than -10\u00b0 Celsius (14\u00b0 Fahrenheit), the ice within it acts as cement. It glues bits of rock together. But if the permafrost warms to around -1 \u00b0C (30 \u00b0F), that ice will change. \u201cIt actually starts to deform, like plastic or Play-Doh,\u201d Svennevig explains. Now individual rock bits no longer stick together. This can allow part of the mountainside to collapse.",
            "Indeed, at the sites of new landslides, he often sees rectangular blocks of frozen rock and gravel within the wreckage. Those house-sized icy blocks slowly thaw and crumble.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Elsewhere, melting ice has caused similar disasters.",
            "In 2016, two mountain glaciers in Tibet suddenly collapsed. Gradual warming weakened the Aru-1 and Aru-2 glaciers until their ice could no longer hold onto the mountain. The debris from this disintegration sent enough snow and ice cascading into a valley to fill 60,000 Olympic swimming pools.",
            "The ice and snow traveled up to eight kilometers (five miles) from its source. Along the way, it killed nine herders and hundreds of livestock.",
            "Melting Himalayan glaciers create a different hazard, too. Vast lakes of meltwater have formed behind huge rock piles at the ends of the glaciers. These lakes can suddenly burst out of their fragile natural dams. The resulting \u201coutburst floods\u201d can gush tens of kilometers down through any valley below, sweeping away people, homes, bridges and animals.\u00a0",
            "But landslide-tsunamis are especially worrisome because they often happen at sites with more people.",
            "In 1936, one roared through Lake Lovatnet in Norway. It swept away two villages, killing 74 people. And in 1958, a wave in Lituya Bay, Alaska, struck three large fishing vessels. One capsized and sank. One was tossed onto a hillside and destroyed. The third was tossed over a narrow strip of land and into deeper water; that boat, its captain and his 10-year-old son somehow survived.",
            "More recently, a 2017 landslide-tsunami flooded a village in western Greenland, killing four.",
            "But the risk of such an event around cruise ships that venture into fjords could prove especially catastrophic.",
            "\u201cThat is something that we definitely think a lot about,\u201d says Katherine Barnhart. She\u2019s a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. She studies landslide and tsunami risks in Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound. Much like Dickson Fjord in Greenland, steep mountains line its narrow, branching bay. And here, too, glaciers are shrinking.",
            "Detailed studies like the one Svennevig just published will help Barnhart accomplish a difficult task: building a computer program that can predict the size of a tsunami that a potential landslide might cause. \u201cBuilding up an inventory of events that have happened is really valuable,\u201d she explains.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/60T9TKuuujs?feature=oembed",
            "Authors of the new study explain how it took dozens of scientists to diagnose the source of an \u201cunusual seismic object, or USO\u201d that traveled around the globe for more than a week. Such events, they explain, can have deadly outcomes.",
            "The latest discovery leads Svennevig to worry that things could become worse. Far worse.",
            "Two years ago, one of his collaborators noticed something strange. At the time, Matthew Owen was a marine geologist at Aarhus University in Denmark. He was building sonar maps of the seafloor in Vaigat strait. It\u2019s a narrow ocean channel off western Greenland. These 3-D seafloor maps were being made to help scientists predict how future tsunamis would move through the water.",
            "As Owen assembled the maps, he noticed several large mounds on the bottom of the channel. Each covered many square kilometers. They looked like the mounds that a landslide would drop \u2014 except much bigger. Strewn along the seafloor were rectangular rocks the size of skyscrapers.",
            "\u201cSome of these individual blocks were bigger than the recent landslides\u201d that killed people, recalls Owen. (He now works at Global Maritime, a company in England that builds off-shore wind-energy farms.)",
            "When Owen showed these maps to Svennevig, they noticed something important. Each mound sat in front of a massive valley carved into the mountains above. Until then, no one had dared to think that those gouged valleys might be due to landslides. \u201cThey were just too big to comprehend,\u201d says Svennevig.",
            "Some were up to 100 times larger than the recent landslides. One had dumped up to 8.4 cubic kilometers (2 cubic miles) of rock onto the seafloor. That\u2019s enough to build 2,800 stacks of rock the size of the Empire State Building.",
            "Those landslides would have triggered enormous waves \u2014 many hundreds of meters high. Even 30 to 100 kilometers (18 to 60 miles) from where they formed, he found, waves had tossed rock and gravel as high as 70 meters (230 feet) up onto the land. At a similar distance, recent tsunamis like the one at Dickson Fjord had risen only about one-twentieth that high.",
            "These gigantic landslides likely happened at the end of the last Ice Age, some 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. That\u2019s when glaciers were retreating. And this rapid change destabilized the mountains.",
            "The Arctic\u2019s present-day warming could set the stage for a repeat of this, says Svennevig. \u201cWe should prepare for a future where these giant landslides can become a reality again.\u201d"

And they might even prevent stall \u2014 a sudden loss of lift that can happen when a wing meets oncoming air at a high angle.",

            "Installing a single row of flaps near the rear of an airfoil brought a different benefit. It blocked high-pressure air near the trailing edge of the wing from creeping toward the wing front. That\u2019s key, because low pressure is needed in the front to produce lift, Wissa explains. Adding five rows of flaps to airfoils improved lift by up to 45 percent. At the same time, it reduced drag by 31 percent.",

Water pumped through pads inside the tower cools the air. Cooled air sinks to the lobby, keeping visitors comfortable. The idea borrows from Iranian windcatchers (right).",
            "Rather than walls, the second design focuses on roofs and how air flows indoors. Its passive radiative cooling draws from ancient designs used throughout many hot, dry parts of the world (think the Middle East or the U.S. Southwest).",
            "Long before there were air conditioners, ancient builders tinted or painted roofs and walls light colors to reflect the sun\u2019s warming rays back into space. These old homes also had thick, dense walls. The walls would absorb indoor heat by day and release it to the outdoors, slowly, at night. That slow release kept indoor air from getting too cold.",
            "The team drew from these classic ideas. Then it added a few modern innovations, explains Salmaan Craig. This building scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, led the project.",
            "For one, his group topped its structure\u2019s roof with a high-tech cover. It reflects the sun\u2019s warming rays while also emitting thermal energy that had been stored in the building. Then they designed strategically placed vents to allow air to move in and out. This set up a controlled mixing of warm and cool air.",
            "To test how well this design might keep interior spaces cool, Craig\u2019s team built a pair of small model \u201chomes.\u201d One included all the new features. The other modeled features and materials found in most of today\u2019s homes (although with no A/C).",
            "Then they placed four water bottles inside each model. Water absorbs and releases heat well. So these bottles acted as the thermal mass for the structures. Like the thick walls of ancient buildings, this mass absorbs indoor heat. Each model was then left for two days at a sunny desert site in Topanga, Calif. Sensors measured indoor heat and air flow in and out of each \u201chome.\u201d",
            "The new design stayed, on average, 1.6 \u00baC (2.9 \u00baF) cooler inside than the outside air. In contrast, the standard design was 4.3 \u00baC (7.7 \u00baF) warmer, on average, than the air outside.",
            "These results were good, but indoor temperatures kept going up and down, like a roller coaster. They varied by up to 6.8 \u00baC (12 \u00baF) over the day.",
            "To fix that, the team added two more water bottles to each home. This greater thermal mass helped indoor temps remain more stable. And the test home now drew in twice as much fresh air and expelled twice as much stale air as before.",
            "The average indoor temp was now 3.9 \u00baC (7.0 \u00baF) cooler than outside. It was 8.9 \u00baC (16 \u00baF) cooler than air in the standard-home model!",

Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",

Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",

When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air.

If the flow reversed, clean water might become dirtied by germs or other contaminants. But keeping the flow moving one direction isn\u2019t always easy; it often requires valves that can break.

Working with scientists who have different backgrounds is \u201cthe best way to make discoveries in the lab,\u201d she explains.",
            "Her team started by 3-D printing short, rigid tubes using a material called resin. These didn\u2019t bend or flex. Each tube had a different shaped helix inside. Imagine Slinky toys that were more or less stretched out and had wires with different widths.",
            "The team varied how much of the inside of each tube a helix covered. Some helices were skinny and left a large opening in the middle. Others seemed to fill the entire tube when you peered through one end. The researchers also varied the angle of the helix. Sometimes it was nearly perpendicular to the tube wall. Other times it was slanted sharply downward from the tube\u2019s wall.",

            "To test which helices worked best to control flow, the researchers hooked up the tubes to flowing water. Then they measured the rate of flow coming out the end of the pipe. In half of the tests, the tubes were attached with the helix pointing down, just like a spiral slide. This is the way a shark\u2019s intestine is oriented. The other times, this helix pointed up, like an upside-down slide.",
            "When the helix pointed down, water flowed two to three times faster than when it had been pointed upward. The helix had therefore helped keep water flowing in one direction. Effects didn\u2019t seem to change with the various angles and coils of the helices; most of these worked pretty well.",

            "The researchers 3-D printed a set of tubes that could flex as a fluid moved through them. It\u2019s like how your body might bend when you stand in a stream or current, Keller notes.",
            "Her team again compared the flow of water when the helix was pointing down versus when it was pointing up. Once more, pointing down proved faster \u2014 a whopping 15 times faster than in the other direction, Levin says. \u201cThat\u2019s a big effect!\u201d",
            "\u201cWater pushes on the deformable pipe, bending parts of it,\u201d Keller notes. This \u201cin turn changes the flow of the water.\u201d Her team doesn\u2019t yet know why bending the pipe sped up the flow. But they\u2019re excited to figure that out.",
            "Such helical pipes might one day be used for a variety of applications. \u201cMost valves have moving parts that open and close\u201d to prevent backward flow, Nelson says. \u201cThese valves can wear out over time and must be replaced.\u201d Helical tubes could replace valves in hard-to-reach locations, he says. Those might be in drainage systems or air-flow systems where one-way flow is essential.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s super exciting that studying these everyday things [like shark guts] can lead to big scientific breakthroughs,\u201d Levin says. \u201cI love that my next big idea for a science project might come from just hanging out in my backyard and noticing something new.

            "The quantum realm is full of seemingly impossible things. But one of the strangest has to be entanglement.",
            "Entanglement is a special way of linking up particles. When two particles become entangled, their features are perfectly in sync. Such features might include their position or speed. If you measure the properties of one particle, you automatically know the properties of the other. And whatever happens to one will also affect the other.",
            "This is true no matter how far apart two entangled particles are. They could be on opposite sides of the planet, the solar system or even the universe. Even then, observing one would still instantly tell you what\u2019s going on with the other.",
            "Scientists first proposed entanglement was possible in the 1930s. But not everyone was on board with the idea. One famous skeptic was Albert Einstein. His problem was that with entangled particles, it would be possible to instantly tell someone what\u2019s happening infinitely far away. This would suggest that information can travel infinitely fast. And nothing, not even information, is supposed to be able to travel faster than the speed of light. For that reason, Einstein dubbed the idea of entanglement \u201cspooky action at a distance.\u201d",
            "Lab experiments have since shown that particles can indeed become entangled. Those experiments won three researchers the 2022 Nobel Prize in physics.

That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",

            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",

Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",
            "The scientists observed the glob while the wheel was spinning. They looked at it again after it stopped. They checked whether the mayo had returned to its original form, changed shape or broken apart. This determined the border between its elastic and plastic behaviors, they explain in the May Physical Review E.",
            "Working with mayo does have one drawback. When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"
