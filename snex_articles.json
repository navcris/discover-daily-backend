            "In fourth grade, Logan Lee\u2019s class took a trip to the island of Hawaii. There, they saw an i\u2019iwi, a native Hawaiian forest bird. Logan was in awe. The bird was beautiful \u2014 and seeing one was a rare treat. Like many of Hawaii\u2019s birds, this one is highly vulnerable to avian malaria. So Logan, now 18, set out to see how he could help curb the spread of this disease.",

            "Mosquitoes spread the malaria parasite. One way to fight malaria is by releasing lab-grown mosquitoes infected with a special bacteria. It renders the insects infertile. When released into nature, these mosquitoes mate with wild ones and lay eggs that cannot hatch. That will shrink the mosquito population over time.",
            "One problem: Many of the lab-grown mosquitoes don\u2019t survive well enough in the wild to complete their mission.",
            "Logan suspected that might be because the insects lacked key microbes that wild mosquitoes pick up from their environment. So he exposed the lab-grown insects to microbes from the water where wild mosquitoes mature. This treatment sped the lab-grown mosquitoes\u2019 growth by 18 percent. And it boosted their fitness by 67 percent. That may help scientists raise more mosquitoes faster and give the skeeters better odds of surviving in the wild.",
            "Logan is currently a senior at the \u2018Iolani School in Honolulu, Hawaii. His research earned him fourth place at the 2025 Regeneron Science Talent Search.

You\u2019re not sure how to use some of the things in the lab. How to be very precise with your measurements, things like that. Learning how to do all that was definitely a challenge in the beginning.\u201d",
            "Logan found that his teacher and a mentor in a lab at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa \u2014 where he did much of his research \u2014 were both key. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so incredibly impactful, not only in helping me develop my research, but also helping me develop as a scientist,\u201d he says. \u201cLearning about ethics in research. Learning about how to do things meticulously in the lab. It\u2019s these things that I bring outside of just my research life, and I\u2019m able to apply them to make myself a better person.\u201d",
            "Adaptive radiation is a term that describes what happens when one species quickly diversifies into many species. Logan is currently studying this adaptive radiation of Hawaii\u2019s forest birds.",
            "Many native Hawaiian forest birds descend from \u201cone ancestor that came here, and it rapidly diversified,\u201d Logan says. \u201cIt\u2019s really shown through their beaks, because the birds developed to have different food sources.\u201d The palila has a big, seed-cracking bill. Honeycreepers like the i\u2019iwi dip their long beaks into flowers for nectar. Owls use their long upper beaks to fish insects out of bark. \u201cI\u2019m looking a little bit at the genetic basis of adaptive radiation,\u201d Logan explains. \u201cSo these genes in the birds, where might there be changes that affected how the birds developed?\u201d",

For example, all helium atoms have two protons. Helium\u2019s atomic number is 2. If an atom has two protons, it\u2019s a helium atom. If, by some process, a helium atom gains two more protons, it will no longer be helium. It would now be beryllium.",
            "This process doesn\u2019t always change the element. If only the number of neutrons in a nucleus changes, the element stays the same. That\u2019s because the number of protons, not neutrons, determines the element type.",
            "Most nucleosynthesis occurs in the cosmos. It started with the Big Bang, which exploded our universe into being. As matter and space rapidly expanded from the Big Bang, particles started to group together. Some of those particles were protons and neutrons. And in joining them together, the Big Bang created atomic nuclei. Scientists believe that lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, came from nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang.",
            "Other elements have been forged inside stars. During its lifetime, a star fuses lighter nuclei \u2014 such as hydrogen and helium \u2014 into heavier ones. The extreme gravity in the star\u2019s core drives this process. This is called stellar nucleosynthesis. This is where much of the carbon, iron and other elements crucial for life originate.",
            "Even in death, stars can form new elements. When supermassive stars die, they don\u2019t just fade away. They explode as a supernova. This releases huge amounts of energy. Enough energy to fuse nuclei together and create new elements. Scientists believe supernova nucleosynthesis made much of the oxygen in our universe. Supernovas likely cooked up most of the elements heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium, too.",

These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",

He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often.",

He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",

And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",

But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",

            "The formal name for this lifelong condition is autism spectrum disorder, or ASD. However, some experts, including many autistic people, argue that it\u2019s not a disorder. Instead, they explain, it\u2019s just a different \u2014 and not-uncommon \u2014 type of brain development.",
            "By age 8, about one in every 36 children\u00a0will be identified as autistic. That number comes from 2020 data on U.S. children.

They attain different heights and become good at different things. How the human brain develops \u2014 and functions \u2014 can vary, too. Yet over time, society has labeled only one brain type as normal, Shekhar says. \u201cAnybody\u2019s brain that worked differently started to be called impaired or deficient,\u201d she says. That included the brains of autistic people.",

For example, certain brain structures are enlarged in autistic children and teens. (They may be in adults, too. Scientists are still studying that.) Studies also have shown that autistic brains respond differently to stimuli than do non-autistic ones.",
            "Autism seems to be mostly genetic. Parents pass down to their children genes that have been linked to this type of brain development. Some research suggests environmental factors also may play some role. However, direct links to such non-genetic factors have not yet been proven.

They want to protect their children from diseases that can cause permanent harm or even death. Yet some parents say no. Many of these people base that refusal on a 1998 study that claimed to find a link between autism and vaccines.",
            "Autism is a disorder that affects how the brain develops. Its symptoms can range from mild to severe. These symptoms can start to appear around the same time that kids get many of their vaccinations.\u00a0So the 1998 study worried parents. Many feared their kids might develop autism after getting the MMR vaccine. That vaccine gets its name from the fact that it protects against three major childhood diseases: measles, mumps and rubella.",

Still, some people haven\u2019t learned about that or refuse to believe data that find no signs of an autism link. None. The most recent of these follow-up studies \u2014 and the largest \u2014 came out March 5, 2019 in the\u00a0Annals of Internal Medicine. Like the others, it found no link between autism and vaccines.",
            "In this new study, Anders Hviid of the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark and his colleagues collected data on more than 657,000 Danish children between 1999 and 2013. They followed the children from age 1. Denmark provides free vaccines for children. As a result, most families chose to have their kids receive the MMR vaccine. But not all.",
            "Over the study period, 6,517 children were diagnosed with autism. But the team found that children who got the MMR vaccine were no more likely to be diagnosed with autism than were those who didn\u2019t get it. Groups that might be more susceptible to autism also did not have an increased risk from being vaccinated.",
            "The initial claim of a possible autism link appeared in The Lancet. A small study, it had focused on just 11 boys and one girl with autism. Led by a surgeon in England, Andrew Wakefield, this study linked autism in these kids to their having gotten the MMR vaccine.",
            "That 1998 study had not been performed well. Later research would show this. That didn\u2019t stop parents around the world from panicking over its claims, however.",

Much larger studies investigated further. They, too, failed to find support for the claim made by Wakefield\u2019s team. More than that, research turned up evidence that Wakefield committed fraud. A series of articles published in BMJ, a British medical journal, outlined much of the evidence for that in 2011.",
            "Despite all of this, the 1998 study\u2019s claims have mushroomed online. One 2016 study in the\u00a0Journal of Communication in Healthcare found nearly 500 anti-vaccine websites. The study\u2019s authors looked at tactics used by different websites. Fear of autism is a big theme, thanks to the now-discredited study, it found. Some websites even cast Wakefield as a victim. Those websites dismissed or excused the big problems with his report.",
            "Other websites included vague appeals to readers\u2019 values or emotions. Some sites argued for individual freedom of choice. Those arguments don\u2019t mention that public health and safety laws protect everyone. Other websites fostered distrust of doctors and companies that make vaccines.

But Wakefield\u2019s group didn\u2019t just make mistakes, scientists would find. And the 1998 study wasn\u2019t just false. It was \u201cfraudulent,\u201d editors of\u00a0BMJ would later report.",
            "In January 2010, a government panel in the United Kingdom announced that it had found many problems with the 1998 study. Wakefield, for example, had gotten money from lawyers involved in lawsuits against the companies that make vaccines. That\u2019s considered a \u201cconflict of interest.\u201d Wakefield also was charged with picking and choosing data to show what he wanted. That reflected poor study design. Evidence also showed that the team had fudged data \u2014 changed them to make them say what Wakefield wanted. Beyond that, there were ethical problems with how Wakefield\u2019s team had gotten data on the children.",
            "Wakefield lost his medical license. And\u00a0The Lancet\u00a0retracted his group\u2019s paper in February 2010. Scientific journals have since become more attentive to signs of potential fraud.",

She felt safe and calm inside, as though someone was protecting her.",

And she developed new designs for slaughterhouses. Rather than force cattle on a straight path, her designs led the animals along curving runways.

They selectively breed animals with these traits. But they don\u2019t think about other traits, such as strength or resistance to disease. As a result, Grandin sees many animals that lead shorter and less healthy lives.",

The final group just rested.",
            "Afterward, only one group could play the tricky pattern faster than before. These were the pianists who used the robotic hand to practice the complex finger motions quickly. The time between their keystrokes sped up by around 6 percent, on average.",
            "The pianists often told Furuya that their fingers felt \u201cvery light\u201d after using the robot. Also, they only used the device on their right hands. Yet their left hand\u2019s speed also improved!",
            "\u201cI was stunned by that, actually,\u201d says Hatsopoulos.",
            "One day after training with the robot, these pianists could still play faster than usual.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/Xhn0UbR3hwU?feature=oembed",
            "Shinichi Furuya invited dozens of professional pianists to his lab to try the robotic hand. Using it \u201cis a very interesting sensation,\u201d he says. \u201cAll pianists start to laugh.\u201d But when they see how well it works, he says, \u201cthey\u2019re very excited.\u201d",
            "Furuya doesn\u2019t expect the effect to last much longer than that, though. He thinks pianists would probably have to use the device regularly to maintain the speed bonus.",
            "Alas, they can\u2019t do this now. \u201cThis is still a prototype,\u201d explains Furuya, so they can\u2019t yet take the device home with them.",
            "Hatsopoulos thinks this robotic training likely rewired some neural connections in the musicians\u2019 brains. The somatosensory (So-MAT-oh-SEN-or-ee) cortex is the brain region responsible for handling sensory feedback. It\u2019s what gets activated as the robot wiggles people\u2019s fingers.",
            "When someone wiggles their own fingers, a different part of the brain \u2014 the motor cortex \u2014 manages that motion.",
            "But these two parts of the brain share information, says Hatsopoulos. So do the left and right sides of the brain, which control the opposite sides of the body, he notes. These connections could help explain why the training improved the musicians\u2019 speed in their left hands, even though they only wore the device on their right.",
            "Doctors and researchers already use robotic devices similar to this one in therapy, notes Hatsopoulos. For example, a stroke often impairs movement on one side of the body. Using a robot to move an arm can help a patient get back their former range of motion.",
            "Exoskeletons that move fingers and hands have lagged behind, though. That\u2019s because robotic fingers are complex and \u201charder to build,\u201d says Hatsopoulos.",
            "The robot hand Furuya\u2019s team built can only move fingers one way \u2014 in a downward motion. \u201cWe are developing a more complex robot,\u201d he says. It will be able to move two joints at once. That will allow for even more complex finger movements.",
            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

Ese mensaje es alto y claro, y simplemente brillante, dice Williams.",

Pero sus c\u00e9lulas musculares generan calor a la misma tasa que las de los adultos. Eso muestra que esta estrategia de fugas de energ\u00eda comienza temprano. Los cient\u00edficos tambi\u00e9n vieron que la fuga de energ\u00eda es similar en las nutrias salvajes y las cautivas. Esto sugiere que esas fugas son una \u201cfuerza impulsora\u201d del metabolismo de las nutrias, explica Wright.",

            "Our brains change throughout our lives. Much of this change involves neurons building new connections, or synapses, or trimming back unused ones. In fact, at this very moment, neurons in your brain are exchanging messages along connections that formed as you learned how to read.",
            "Inside your brain, neurons connect in pathways called networks. Through these networks, we observe the world, process information and make decisions. If these networks never changed, neither would we. But they do change. Through this process of un-building and re-building, we learn, grow and recover from injury.",
            "Changes in the brain come more rapidly at some stages in life. Childhood is one example. As a kid, it\u2019s often easier to pick up new skills, such as learning a language or how to ride a bike. That\u2019s because in childhood, the brain is developing and growing a lot. It\u2019s rapidly making new connections between neurons in response to new experiences. In other words, the brain has high neuroplasticity in childhood.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The teen years are another time of rapid change in the brain. High neuroplasticity also means that some experiences affect rapidly-growing young brains more than older ones. That can include unhealthy experiences, such as drug use. Drugs like cannabis can profoundly affect the development of a young person\u2019s brain.",
            "Scientists once thought that the brain stopped changing once you reach adulthood. But we now know that even after we grow up, our brains adapt. Some changes occur in response to experiences. This allows us to form new memories and learn new information. Some changes occur from aging. For example, the brain\u2019s hippocampus \u2014 which plays a role in memory \u2014 begins to shrink. This gradual process begins in early adulthood.",
            "Sometimes, the brain changes in response to injury. After injury, the brain attempts to make repairs. First, the brain tries re-routing information around the damaged part. The brain tries using existing neuron connections to carry out the job that used to be done by the damaged part. But after a few days, the brain starts making new connections. This stage can go on for weeks, months or longer.",
            "Some factors increase the brain\u2019s neuroplasticity. Studies show music can help the brain learn better. A healthy diet and exercise also boost brain health.",
            "Neuroplasticity allows the brain to form new memories in the hippocampus, which appears to rely on relatively sparse but strong neural connections.",

            "When we\u2019re overstressed, our body\u2019s fight-or-flight response can go into overdrive. Acknowledging how we feel and focusing on slow breathing can help restore a sense of balance.",
            "It\u2019s the day of a big test. Your heart is pounding. Your palms are sweating. Your breathing quickens and your stomach suddenly feels full of butterflies. Although these stress responses may not feel good, they are totally normal. They\u2019re your body\u2019s way of sharpening your focus and boosting the energy you have to help you perform well.\u00a0",
            "When we encounter a big challenge or risk \u2014 or become overly excited \u2014 our body responds in a way to keep us safe. We\u2019re hardwired for this. These changes supercharge how our body functions.",
            "An increased heart rate and breathing will send more oxygen to our muscles and brain. Our muscles tense so they can react quickly. By sweating, our body attempts to avoid overheating. Our pupils enlarge so we become more aware of our surroundings. And our body releases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, to boost our energy and focus.",
            "Together, these changes are known as the fight-or-flight response. They\u2019re automatically triggered by what\u2019s known as the sympathetic nervous system. It helps us respond to danger or challenges. They give us more power, more speed and agility. All are important for physical activity, says Katharine Meddles. She\u2019s a neurologist for children in Denver, Colo.\u00a0",
            "This survival mechanism helped our ancient hunter-gatherer ancestors fight or escape from a wild animal \u2014 perhaps a saber-toothed tiger. Today, we face very different risks than people did 300,000 years ago. But our sympathetic nervous system remains very important to our making it through challenging events.",
            "It turns on when we play sports, perform or catch ourselves from falling. It motivates us to study or concentrate on difficult tasks. And it turns on when we\u2019re trying something new or talking to someone we like. Activating that fight-or-flight response in short bursts is healthy.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/NRRBVMFTSWI?feature=oembed",
            "The sympathetic and parasympathetic systems help us respond to serious stressors \u2014 but also can kick in for minor ones, such as spilling your drink.",
            "But as soon as the stimulating event is over, our brain normally sends signals to our body to calm down. This turns on a second system: the parasympathetic nervous system. It handles what\u2019s known as the rest-and-digest response.\u00a0",
            "Here, our heart rate and breathing become slow and steady. Our muscles relax. Stress hormone levels lower, and feel-good hormones \u2014 such as oxytocin and serotonin \u2014 become somewhat higher. This lets us feel safe. We now can think calmly, digest food and sleep, all processes vital to our brain and overall health, notes Meddles.\u00a0",

            "The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems keep our bodies in balance. Together, they make up the autonomic nervous system. By switching us between rest and action, they work together to help us respond appropriately to the range of situations we experience.\u00a0",

            "But sometimes those systems get out of balance. The sympathetic nervous system may stay active for too long. Or it might get stuck in the \u201con\u201d position when it\u2019s not needed.",
            "Our world is full of threats. For example, the erratic impacts of climate change not only are hard to predict but also can pose true threats. Social media can pressure us to live or act a certain way. And parents can pressure us to perform well in a competitive environment.",
            "Encountering such conditions may keep your body stuck in fight-or-flight mode.",
            "Worrying about things is not a failing or a shortcoming, says Meddles. \u201cIt\u2019s natural\u201d and reflects \u201cthe way that our brains are wired.\u201d\u00a0But too much anxiety can leave you overwhelmed and unable to perform well.",
            "\u201cHow you think and how you feel will show up in your body, because the brain and the body are connected,\u201d says Jin Lee. She\u2019s a psychologist for children in Englewood, Colo. When you\u2019re stressed or anxious, your body might feel as if it\u2019s not getting enough air. You might bite your nails. Or freeze up so that you have a hard time thinking or making decisions. Your mind may even go blank.\u00a0",

Preteens and teenagers are in a great position to start learning these skills, she says, because the adolescent brain is so adaptable.",

            "Scientists have finally observed plastic ice (illustrated), a phase between solid ice and liquid water. Plastic ice may form in the interiors of icy worlds, such as Neptune or Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa.",
            "A strange type of ice has just been observed.",
            "It forms at high temperatures and pressures. It possesses traits of both solid ice and liquid water. And researchers have now directly observed it for the first time. They described their findings February 12 in Nature. What they observed may also help scientists better understand worlds beyond Earth.",
            "Plastic ice is \u201csomething intermediate between a liquid and a crystal,\u201d explains Livia Bove. She\u2019s a physicist at CNRS in Paris. \u201cYou can imagine that it is softer when you squeeze it.\u201d It\u2019s called plastic ice because it is more easily molded or deformed than typical crystalline ice. Scientists refer to this Play-Doh-like trait as plasticity.",
            "Explains Bove, it\u2019s \u201clike something that can [squeeze] through a hole and come out, even if it\u2019s still solid.\u201d",
            "The molecules that make up ordinary ice sit in a hexagonal, honeycomb-like shape. Ice cubes, glaciers and snow contain this type of ice. It\u2019s formally known as ice Ih.",
            "In addition to Ih, there are at least 20 other known ice phases. They form under different conditions of pressure and temperature.",
            "At pressures above about 20,000 kilograms per square centimeter (285,466 pounds per square inch), ice smooshes into what\u2019s known as ice VII. It\u2019s densely packed molecules are ordered like the cubies in a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Ice VII has been found trapped in diamonds from Earth\u2019s mantle. It\u2019s also thought to occur inside other planets.\u00a0",
            "Some ice phases exist only in theory. They\u2019ve never been seen.",
            "More than 15 years ago, computer models predicted what would happen if ice VII were heated and put under extreme pressure. As in a liquid, its individual water molecules should start to rotate freely. Yet those molecules also should stay in one place \u2014 as in a solid.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Since this simulated phase shared the same cubic crystal structure as ice VII, it became known as plastic ice VII. But scientists didn\u2019t know whether it truly existed. Running tests at such high pressures wasn\u2019t possible, back then.",
            "For the new study, Bove was part of a team that used a relatively new tool. It can measure the motions of molecules under extreme pressures. It does this by shooting them with tiny particles called neutrons.",
            "Those neutrons interact with molecules in their samples. Depending on the molecules\u2019 motion, the neutrons gain or lose energy \u2014 then scatter away toward a detector. Measuring the scattered neutrons\u2019 energies allowed Bove\u2019s team to figure out how the ice molecules moved. From this, they could identify the ice phase that had formed.",
            "Above 177\u00b0 Celsius (350\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and at a pressure about 28 times that of the deepest point in Earth\u2019s oceans, Bove\u2019s team observed plastic ice VII. As expected, its structure formed a cubic-crystal lattice. And its molecules rotated about as fast as those in liquid water.",

            "fCIn liquid water, individual molecules can freely move about and rotate, while in solid ice they can only vibrate in place. In plastic ice, water molecules are held in place but still are able to rotate.",
            "However, one detail differed from what had been predicted. Rather than revolve freely, plastic ice VII\u2019s molecules appeared to swivel in jerky motions. As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux. He\u2019s a planetary scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Plastic ice VII could have formed then because water hadn\u2019t escaped yet from those moons\u2019 high-pressure interiors, he explains.",
            "The new observations could help researchers piece together the story of how these moons changed over time, he says.",
            "And beyond our solar system, the strange ice may be found on the bottom of super deep oceans on exoplanets. Scientists think plastic ice may cover the seafloors of their oceans.",
            "It would be interesting to find out whether seafloor nutrients could move through plastic ice and into the oceans above, Journaux says. \u201cThat would actually feed the ocean with more nutrients.\u201d And those nutrients could make the oceans more habitable, he says.",
