            "Alba Iglesias works at the University of Valencia, in Spain. She and her coworkers shared the finding August 7 in\u00a0Frontiers in Microbiology.\u00a0This is the first time, they say, that research has shown communities of germs can live in microwave ovens.",
            "The microbiologists swabbed the insides \u2014 both the walls and rotating platter \u2014 of 30 microwave ovens. Ten came from home kitchens. Ten came from labs. The rest were being used in shared spaces, such as cafeterias. Each swab was then transferred to lab dishes. Before long, each dish hosted significant communities of bacteria.",
            "Iglesias\u2019 group then analyzed the microbes\u2019 DNA. Most germs turned out to be types commonly found on human skin and surfaces that people frequently touch. Among them were Firmicutes\u00a0and\u00a0Bacteroidetes. But more worrying, the microwave ovens in kitchens hosted bacteria that can cause food poisoning. These included Klebsiella\u00a0and\u00a0Brevundimonas.",

            "These flights don\u2019t always have a pretty ending. Springtails sometimes crash land and tumble to a stop. But most times, these backflippers nail the landing, the team found. They do this by using a sticky tube normally used for grooming. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of anchor that pulls them to their feet so they can get on with their day,\u201d Smith explains.\u00a0",

In fact, this may be the most common way that the seeds for clouds form. That\u2019s the finding of a study in the July 12 Science.",
            "Earth\u2019s atmosphere has five layers. We live in the troposphere. It\u2019s the lowest one. It also has the densest air. The stratosphere, right above it, has thinner air. It also contains different chemicals than those in our layer.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",
            "Scientists had thought most new atmospheric particles form in the upper troposphere. Clouds would rise into this region and then shed rain. That rain would carry away the existing particles. Gases left behind would have almost no solid particles left to glom onto. So new clouds would not develop until new particles formed.",

The troposphere also contains molecules such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), emitted by fossil fuels and volcanoes. Sunlight and water vapor cause these chemicals to react in ways that generate chemicals such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a building block of tiny aerosol particles. Previous research had suggested that the main way new particles formed were instead \u201ccloud outflows\u201d \u2014 regions where high troposphere clouds break up.",

            "Climate change is expected to speed up stratospheric circulation. In the future, that could cause the stratosphere to poke into the troposphere more frequently. If it does, stratospheric intrusion may become even more important in forming new particles, Wang says.",

            "Right now, he notes, stratospheric intrusion is not yet accounted for in computer models that simulate weather and climate. In other words, these particles may play a bigger role than scientists once thought in how incoming sunlight is distributed on Earth. That includes how much of the sun\u2019s rays reach the planet\u2019s surface. It also includes how much of the sun\u2019s energy aerosols and clouds absorb high in the atmosphere."

Ion engines can last months or even years, possibly helping fuel future trips to Mars. These thrusters, though, aren\u2019t yet strong enough to propel massive spacecraft that far, Young says.\u00a0",

And campfires can stretch thousands of kilometers above the sun\u2019s surface. Each one lasts no longer than a few minutes. But campfires light up much more frequently than larger solar flares \u2014 which could help solve a longstanding mystery about the sun. Namely, why the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, or corona, is so hot.",

            "Centuries ago, astronomers observed a dark oval \u2014 nicknamed the Permanent Spot \u2014 on Jupiter. It was located at the same latitude, or distance from Jupiter\u2019s equator, where the giant windstorm known as the Great Red Spot swirls today. Researchers have wondered whether these spots are the same. Now, a new study suggests the spots are distinct \u2014 and hints at what could become of the Great Red Spot.",

            "Yes, mayonnaise, the same stuff you might put on a sandwich. Dollops of the condiment could help scientists better design nuclear fusion experiments.",
            "Mayonnaise is useful for smearing on sandwiches and\u00a0 prepping potato salads. But scientists are now using it to study nuclear fusion.",
            "How mayonnaise behaves can vary. If jiggled gently, it returns to its original shape. That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",
            "But it\u2019s difficult to study how materials behave under the extreme conditions required for fusion. And that\u2019s where the mayonnaise comes in.",
            "The behavior of the fuel capsule in fusion experiments, it turns out, has a lot in common with mayonnaise. The fuel capsule is a metal or other material that contains a gas (the fuel). When lasers hit the capsule, it melts. The melty capsule can now switch from elastic to plastic.",
            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Two mechanical engineers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., wanted to understand that better. So they looked at how mayo mixes with a gas \u2014 air. Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",
            "The scientists observed the glob while the wheel was spinning. They looked at it again after it stopped. They checked whether the mayo had returned to its original form, changed shape or broken apart. This determined the border between its elastic and plastic behaviors, they explain in the May Physical Review E.",
            "Working with mayo does have one drawback. When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"

When channels are open (right), ions flow freely. ",
            "Every second, cells throughout your body send out small electrical signals. Tiny jolts control your heartbeat. In your brain, cells use electricity to release chemicals that make you feel happy or sad. In your muscles, they send signals that help you run, stand or reach for a glass of water.",
            "But you\u2019re not plugged into an electric outlet. And you\u2019re not carrying around a battery. So where does that electricity come from? The cells themselves create these electric currents through the power of chemistry.",
            "Cells are tiny bags of liquid chemicals, surrounded by an outer fatty jacket known as a membrane.",
            "Those membranes separate chemicals inside the cell from what\u2019s outside it. This separation allows cells to concentrate ions \u2014 atoms and molecules with an electric charge. Get enough of those ions together and the inside of the cell, too, will develop an electric charge.",
            "The average animal cell is more negatively charged on the inside than on the outside. This difference in charge is called an electrochemical gradient. It represents the difference between the concentration and charge of particles on either side of the membrane.",
            "This gradient is not stable.",
            "Ions want to flow toward places where they are less concentrated. Negative ions in the negatively charged inside of a cell want to get out. Positive ions in the positively charged outside want to get in. So a cell\u2019s membrane will trap ions inside the cell \u2014 but only for so long.",
            "Cell membranes are dotted with channels. Think of them as gates that, under certain circumstances, open or shut. Some channels evolved as gates for charged particles \u2014 such as ions of sodium, potassium or calcium. When these channels open, ions flood from the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated.",
            "This chemical flood changes the charge on either side of the membrane. And that change in charge then triggers more channels to open further down a cell\u2019s membrane \u2014 sending the tiny electrical changes racing down toward the ends of the cell. This movement of charges is called an action potential.",

In contrast, these cells tend to concentrate more positive potassium ions inside their membrane, mixed with proteins. But the proteins have a negative charge. So the inside of the cell is much more negative than the outside.",
            "When the charge in one part of a neuron\u2019s membrane begins to change, sodium channels in the membrane will open. At once, sodium ions flood into the cell, bringing their positive charge. They rush in to try and balance both their chemical concentration in the cell and the cell\u2019s electric charge.",
            "This triggers other sodium channels around them to also open. More and more sodium ions move into the cell. As this happens, the negative charge inside the cell moves toward zero.",
            "Channels for potassium ions now open. This allows these ions to leave the cell. Remember that these are positively charged. So when they leave, the charge inside a brain cell will drop back down to become negative again.",
            "At the same time, a large protein in the membrane is constantly at work. Called a sodium-potassium pump, it brings some potassium ions back inside the cell and allows some sodium ions to go back outside the membrane again.",
            "Over time, this restores the original electric charges along the membrane. That also prepares the whole process of ion transport to start again, as needed.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Meanwhile, the electric signal triggered by the initial ion movement spreads along the membrane.",
            "Neurons are cells with small bodies and long tails called axons. Once an action potential trips, it triggers sodium and then potassium channels to open up further and further down the axon. The result is a tiny jolt of electric charge that moves along the cell.",
            "When that zap reaches the end of one neuron\u2019s axon, it spreads out its finger-like ends, known as axon terminals. Each of these is very close to the membrane of another cell.",

From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",

            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in.

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years.

These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",
            "Wait, what\u2019s that behind you? (Boo!)",
            "Kathryn Hulick has been a regular contributor to Science News for Students since 2013. She\u2019s covered everything from laser \u201cphotography\u201d and acne to video games, robotics and forensics. This piece \u2014 her 43rd story for us \u2014 was inspired by her book: Strange But True: 10 of the world\u2019s greatest mysteries explained. (Quarto, October 1, 2019, 128 pages)."

            "Many students study by reading their notes and textbooks over and over again. Research studies show there are more effective ways to use your valuable study time.",
            "As a teen, Faria Sana often highlighted books with markers. \u201cThe colors were supposed to tell me different things.\u201d Later, she recalls, \u201cI had no idea what those highlighted texts were supposed to mean.\u201d",
            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",
            "Nate Kornell \u201cdefinitely did cram\u201d before big tests when he was a student. He\u2019s a psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",
            "*a_kid_sitting_at_a_table_studying_and_looking_really_stressed_out",
            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",
            "*a_girl_explaining_something_to_her_mom",
            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",
            "*a_photo_of_a_person_running_away_from_the_viewer_on_a_leafy_path,_zoomed_in_on_the_feet_and_lower_le",
            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

            "On the morning of September 5, 2023, a loosely swirling system of thunderstorms formed off the western coast of Africa. One day later, that system had turned into Hurricane Lee. A Category 1 storm, it spun with maximum winds of at least 130 kilometers (80 miles) per hour.",
            "Over the next day, it passed over record-warm waters in the North Atlantic. And they fueled a doubling in its wind speed \u2014 to 260 kilometers per hour (160 miles per hour). This storm was now a beast.",
            "In recent years, the world\u2019s oceans have been stockpiling heat as a result of global warming. Now stories of rapidly strengthening tropical cyclones \u2014 hurricanes \u2014 are becoming fairly common. And not just in the Atlantic.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/lqfExHpvLRY?feature=oembed",
            "This short video helps you visualize the powerful difference between a Category 1 hurricane and a monster Cat 5.",
            "On September 6, most eyes were focused on Hurricane Lee, notes Eric Blake. He\u2019s a meteorologist at the U.S. National Hurricane Center. It\u2019s in Miami, Fla. But writing on X (what used to be Twitter), he noted that another storm,\u00a0Hurricane Jova, \u201cis bombing out in the eastern Pacific.\u201d Just a day and a half after organizing into a named storm, it too had exploded \u2014 into a Category 4 hurricane.",
            "Both storms followed Hurricane Idalia, which slammed into Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast on August 30 packing 120 km/hr to 209 km/hr (or 75 mi/hr to 130 mi/hr) winds. Again, in just 24 hours, it had rapidly built into a monster.",
            "And then there was Otis. In just one day, it morphed from a Pacific tropical storm into a 130 km/hr (80 mi/hr) hurricane. It attained this hurricane status at 2 p.m. on October 24, 2023. Within another 10 hours, it revved up into a 260 km/hr (160 mi/hr) Category 5 beast. It slammed into the west coast of Mexico, leveling much of the resort town of Acapulco and killing more than two dozen people.",
            "Each of these storms easily met \u2014 and some greatly exceeded \u2014 the National Hurricane Center\u2019s definition for rapid intensification. That\u2019s a jump in a cyclone\u2019s top sustained winds of at least 56 kph (35 mph) within a day or less. Such quickly strengthening storms leave people little time to prepare. That makes these really dangerous.",
            "An October 19 paper in Scientific Reports has now quantified that trend. Andra Garner of Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., analyzed lifetime wind speeds for every Atlantic cyclone between 1970 and 2020. She divided them into two groups: storms from 1971 to 1990 and storms from 2001 to 2020.",
            "The more recent storms were more than twice as likely to strengthen to a major Category 3 or stronger within 24 hours than the storms in the earlier group, she found. And the likelihood one would intensify from a weak hurricane to a strong one within a day jumped from 3.23 percent to 8.12 percent, she showed. That\u2019s an increase of 40 percent in just a few decades.",
            "Here\u2019s what to know about why such storms are also becoming a trend.",
            "Several ingredients are needed to quickly boost a storm\u2019s power. You must start with very warm ocean water and a lot of\u00a0moist air over it, says Philip Klotzbach. He\u2019s an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Also very important, he adds:\u00a0very low vertical wind shear.",
            "That last term refers to winds at different heights that move at very different speeds and in different directions. High wind shear pulls heat and moisture away from a storm\u2019s center. This chips away at its upper structure as the storm tries to form into a tight twirl.",
            "In 2023, Earth\u2019s climate was impacted by the start of an El Ni\u00f1o. It\u2019s an ocean-driven pattern that emerges every few years. An El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s arrival tends to bring more vertical wind shear in the North Atlantic. So El Ni\u00f1o years tend to host fewer\u00a0Atlantic hurricanes.",
            "But not in 2023.",
            "The El Ni\u00f1o didn\u2019t appear to dampen hurricane formation \u2014 or the power of the storms that developed.",
            "The first half of the hurricane season did not see the unfavorable upper-level wind conditions in the western Atlantic that are \u201ctypical in an El Ni\u00f1o year,\u201d says Ryan Truchelut. He\u2019s president and chief meteorologist at WeatherTiger. The company is based in Tallahassee, Fla.",
            "This held true even in the Caribbean Sea, he noted. And that\u2019s a surprise, he added, because this is where El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s shearing power tends to be strongest.",
            "Generally, El Ni\u00f1o years bring more of a contrast in temps between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The eastern tropical Pacific tends to heat up while the Atlantic stays relatively cool. But 2023 saw\u00a0record-breaking ocean temperatures\u00a0in the North Atlantic Ocean and in the Gulf of Mexico. The El Ni\u00f1o warmed Pacific waters about 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal. Parts of the Atlantic warmed more \u2014 up to 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F) above normal.",
            "Contrasting temperatures between the oceans drive jets, Truchelut says. Jets are fast air currents moving high in the atmosphere. A 2023 \u201clack of this contrast is likely responsible for the missing [wind] shear,\u201d he concludes.",

            "Rotating thunderstorms known as supercells are the storms that give rise to most tornadoes.",
            "Tornadoes are one of the most feared weather events on Earth. These quick-forming and normally short-lived cyclones tend to emerge from strongly rotating thunderstorms known as supercells. Driven by a long-lasting tower of rising air, these storms can unleash some of the fastest surface winds on Earth. Rising as much as 16.1 kilometers (10 miles) high, supercells can encompass a volume of air up to 25 times the size of Mount Everest. Some have been known to pummel the ground with hailstones the size of grapefruits.",
            "Simply stated, these things are beasts. ",
            "Despite their intensity, supercells are relatively small compared to most thunderstorms. Supercells typically are no more than 19.3 kilometers (12 miles) across. That\u2019s why one neighborhood might be ravaged by wind and hail, while the next might escape untouched.",
            "*350_Cappuci_supercellpng",
            "fC\nSupercell on May 16, 2017, near Sayre, Okla. It dropped a tornado that killed a man in Elk City. You see the updraft, where the air is spiraling upwards. A curtain of rain under the cloud swooping up left is a downdraft with winds of up to 80 miles per hour. (The storm destroyed the author\u2019s windshield with softball-sized hail.) A lowering ragged cloud is visible underneath \u2014 where the tornado would eventually develop.\n",
            "The secret to a supercell\u2019s power is its isolation. These loners don\u2019t share their environment with neighboring storms. That allows them to gobble up all the surrounding air as \u201cfuel.\u201d While most thunderstorms form in a line and feature multiple updrafts \u2014\u00a0or pockets of rising air \u2014\u00a0supercells are different. They only have one updraft. But that one is extremely powerful. That\u2019s why supercells are small but feisty.",
            "What truly sets supercells apart is their rotation. The entire storm spins like a top due to wind shear. That\u2019s a change in the speed or direction of winds with height.",
            "In the Northern Hemisphere, spinning up a supercell normally requires moist southerly winds on the ground. This fuels the storm. That storm also needs dry air at mid-level heights. It helps if the dry air comes from the west. That will tend to keep the surface air from rising \u2014\u00a0until an explosive updraft punctures through this layer.",
            "Finally, the storm needs cold air up high, arriving from the northwest. Air will rise as long as it is less dense \u2014\u00a0which usually means warmer \u2014 than the air around it. The chilly upper atmosphere tops off this highly unstable environment: It allows a growing storm to rise unimpeded. The rotating base of the storm cloud evolves into what scientists call a mesocyclone.",
            "When all of these conditions come together, air can spiral in to the south side of the storm. This then wraps into the vortex of spinning air in a corkscrew motion. The vortex has very powerful suction. Moisture in its air rapidly condenses to form a cloud. This is due to the air pressure: It\u2019s lower inside the spinning air column than outside it. In fact, that\u2019s why tendrils of cloud rising into the soon-to-be-tornado can seem to materialize out of thin air.",
            "When conditions are just right, the rotation may whirl ever more tightly into a narrow tube. This funnel cloud is what can become a tornado. The funnel\u2019s finger-like spinning protrusion often snakes down towards the surface. Only when it reaches the ground does it officially become a tornado.",
            "In particularly dry climates, there may not be much water vapor near the ground. So there\u2019s nothing to condense within the funnel when the tornado reaches the surface. That can make part of the tube invisible! After all, it\u2019s just rotating air. It only becomes visible when its whirling winds hit something or pick up enough dirt. That\u2019s why it\u2019s extremely important to seek shelter whenever a rotating cloud is spotted. You never know what might be lurking below it. An invisible twister may already extend to the surface.",
            "Most supercells that spawn tornadoes also serve up other types of damage. These include\u00a0straight-line winds of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) per hour, destructive hail and potentially deadly lightning.",
            "Conditions worsen as one approaches the region of the storm containing the twister. Here the updraft is strongest. This rising air can even spawn the growth of enormous ice chunks that may eventually be pelted out as hailstones baseball-size or larger. Often, sheets of heavy rain wrap tornadoes or blow around the funnel, hiding it from view.",
            "Most supercells form when sun-warmed air rises quickly and high. But there can be other sources of triggering heat, such as volcanoes or fires. The Carr Fire outside Redding, Calif., for instance, created a firenado on July 26, 2018. National Weather Service experts found evidence it had winds in excess of 230 kilometers (143 miles) per hour.",

But with a good grip, others can weather the storm. A new study suggests that such hurricanes helped lizards evolve traits that allow them to hang tight.",
            "Colin Donihue is an ecologist who studies evolution at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo. He and his colleagues had been studying two populations of Caribbean anole (Anolis scriptus). This work focused on the island territory of Turks and Caicos. Then, in 2017, hurricanes Irma and Maria pummeled islands in the Caribbean Sea. The extremely powerful storms struck within a few weeks of each other.",

The feet of surviving lizards tended to have larger toepads than those from before the hurricanes, they found. \u201cThat was a surprise,\u201d Donihue says. It suggested hurricanes might play a role in natural selection.",

            "However, it was not clear that extreme weather was pushing lizards to evolve better grips. Evolution can be a long, slow process. And evidence of long-term changes can be difficult to find. One approach is to study how a population changes over a very long time. But Donihue and his team took a different tack.",
            "Caribbean islands each have their own history of hurricanes. Some have been hit frequently. Others have seen less storm activity. The researchers thought higher storm frequency might shape where lizards evolved to have better grips.",

The researchers also reviewed hurricane data collected over the last 70 years. They came up with a measure for hurricane activity experienced by each species based on how many times it was hit by these severe storms.",
            "\u201cIt seems that hurricanes are immensely important,\u201d Donihue says. Hurricanes indeed appear to shape lizard diversity by helping them evolve clingy toes. The team shared its findings April 27 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

So harsh chemicals are used to break it down into a liquid that can turn the fabric blue.\u00a0Each year, tens of thousands of tons of these harsh chemicals go into making denim across the world. Many are then dumped as waste into streams.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very toxic to both the environment [and] also the workers,\u201d says Katrine Qvortrup. She\u2019s a chemist at Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby.",

            "For their new dyeing technique, the researchers chose to use indican. It\u2019s the substance in indigo plants from which natural indigo dye is made. And unlike indigo, indican does dissolve in water. That means using it directly requires fewer harsh chemicals.",
            "In the past, others have used bacteria to make indican. But this only worked for producing small batches. To make enough for the big denim industry, the Danish team needed a new way. Their solution: Tweak an indican-producing enzyme found in indigo plants. This enzyme can make enough indican for factory-scale production, the researchers say.",
            "Their first idea was to mix indican with a second enzyme that would convert it to indigo. Then they dipped yarn in this liquid solution. It worked \u2014 the yarn turned blue within a few minutes.",
            "This sped-up video shows denim developing color over 40 minutes after being soaked in an enzyme solution.",

            "It turns out that sunlight reacted with the indican on the yarn, converting it to indigo.",
            "How? The light turned a substance in the indican into a radical. A radical is a molecule with unpaired outer electrons, which primes it to bond to other molecules. Once turned into radicals, indoxyl molecules can bond with each other to form indigo.",

Then, they exposed the mix to various light sources. \u201cVery slowly, over the next couple of hours, [the yarn] will turn blue, and more and more blue,\u201d Welner says. \u201cThe light will develop the color.\u201d",

            "Using indican as a dye \u2014 with either an enzyme or light \u2014 would reduce the environmental harm from denim dyeing, the researchers say.",
            "They calculated the impact of each method using factors such as the materials involved, wastes produced and more. They looked at things such as carbon dioxide emissions and worker exposures to toxic chemicals.",
            "The enzyme-based method seems most promising. It could cut the harmful impacts by more than 90 percent, compared to normal denim dyeing, the scientists estimate.",
            "Light-driven dyeing is also less harmful than current methods, though not by quite as much. It might cut the impacts of dyeing denim by more than 70 percent. But the light method might take up less space than the enzyme method \u2014 and use less land. And if the researchers can cut electricity costs by dyeing with just sunlight, not bulbs, the light method may prove even better for the environment.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Using indican instead of indigo may be much better for the environment in some ways, says Robert Vos. He\u2019s a sustainability scientist who did not take part in the new project. Vos works at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. But, he notes, the new dyeing methods still use lots of water. And this is a concern because a lot of water also goes into growing the cotton used to make denim.",
            "Both of the new indican-dyeing methods will require more testing before either can be used in factories. But at least cost shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Even with the cost of materials, such as LED lights, the light method may not raise the cost of denim dyeing at all, Qvortrup estimates. The enzyme method should cost only a few cents more per pair of jeans.",

Simply learning about more sustainable ways to make jeans may make denim-wearers think about where their clothes come from, she says. \u201cIf you want to wear blue denim,\u201d she says, \u201cbe aware that there are better ways to make it\u201d than are used right now."

            "In a humid coastal rainforest, a litter of pink, hairless babies snuggle with their mom. They stir and squeak for milk and drink from their mother until they are full. But these are no puppies or cubs. They are snake-shaped amphibians, far closer to frogs than to foxes.",
            "Mammals are named for their ability to produce milk. But scientists have found that a few species that are not mammals feed their young this way, too. These include certain spiders, fishes, cockroaches and birds \u2014 and now, snake-shaped amphibians. Ringed caecilians (Siphonops annulatus) are the first amphibians known to feed hatchlings a kind of \u201cmilk.\u201d Researchers reported their new finding March 8 in Science.",
            "Caecilians (Seh-SEEL-yenz) have many strange features. Rarely seen, they are burrowing creatures that are nearly blind. Some species, like the ringed caecilian, have poisonous slime and may be venomous. They feed their own skin to their young.",
            "Herpetologist Carlos Jared of the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, has been studying these animals for years. After hatching, ringed caecilian babies live with their mothers for two months. Jared and his research team found that the babies spent much of their time around the end of their mom\u2019s body. That\u2019s where there\u2019s an opening called a vent. It\u2019s shared by mom\u2019s reproductive, digestive and urinary systems.",
            "Jared\u2019s team saw the female would expel a thick fluid from her vent. Her young then would enthusiastically feed on it.\u00a0",
            "\u201cSome [young] even stuck their heads inside this opening,\u201d Jared notes.",
            "For the new study, the team worked in Bahia state in Brazil. They collected 16 females and their babies, then observed them in the lab. In all, they videoed these mothers and babies for more than 240 hours.",
            "Feedings started with the babies wriggling and nibbling at their mother\u2019s vent. They also made high-pitched noises. Mom would then raise that end of her body and release the fluid. This happened up to six times per day. It looked like the mothers were responding to the babies\u2019 pleas.\u00a0",
            "The squeaking and begging is a fascinating observation, says Mark Wilkinson. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist in England at the London Natural History Museum. Adult ringed caecilians are thought to be sensitive only to lower pitched sounds, he says. So it\u2019s surprising that moms seem to respond to high-pitched noises from their young.",

            "This \u201cmilk\u201d is rich in fats, much as mammal milk is. This nutritious resource may help explain how the hatchlings grow so fast. They more than double their mass in the first week of life. Their only other nourishment is their mother\u2019s skin, which they feed on once every few days.",
            "Isabella Capellini wonders if the squiggly siblings compete for milk access. She studies evolution at Queen\u2019s University Belfast in Northern Ireland. Capellini is also curious about how the \u201cmilk\u201d production affects the mother.",

That is, it requires a lot of energy from food or her stored fat. \u201cIt would be useful to study whether milk production is as expensive in caecilians, too,\u201d Capellini says. \u201cHow is the mother impacted in the short and long term?\u201d",
            "It\u2019s not known how these amphibians evolved their version of milk. But a clue may come from other caecilian species that give birth to live young. Their oviducts sometimes feed their babies a milky substance while in the womb. These species, however, do not feed their babies after they\u2019re born.",
            "Perhaps live-bearing caecilians \u201ccould have evolved from [egg-laying] species that already used their oviducts to produce food,\u201d Wilkinson says. \u201cWe really have learned a lot about caecilians in the last few decades. But we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg.\u201d"

So in theory, a black hole could be made out of densely packed energy \u2014 light \u2014 rather than matter. This would be a kugelblitz, which is German for \u201cball lightning.\u201d",
            "But new research suggests that the rules of quantum physics would keep kugelblitzes from forming. According to quantum physics, when light gets too highly concentrated, something strange happens. Electrons and their antimatter partners (positrons) start to form. Those particles could then escape a region of densely packed light, taking energy with them. That would keep light from ever concentrating enough to form a black hole. Not even the superbright centers of active galaxies could produce light intense enough to overcome this limit.",

He\u2019s a chemical biologist at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). He\u2019s also a founder of Algenesis Materials. It\u2019s a company developing a new plastic.",
            "Most plastics have been made from crude oil, a fossil fuel. Four years ago, Burkart\u2019s team at UCSD developed a new type. They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",
            "The researchers described the finding March 12 in Scientific Reports.",
            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",

He\u2019s also the chief executive officer of Algenesis Materials. To break down the microplastics, \u201cyou need them to be wet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you break that cycle, even for a short period of time, you kill the microorganisms.\u201d",

            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",

            "Polyurethane is sometimes used to coat natural fibers, like wool and cotton, for clothing, Erdle says. Over time, that plastic coating flakes off, \u201cfragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces and never going away.\u201d Having something that can readily be broken down by bacteria, she says, is better than \u201chaving persistent plastic in the environment.\u201d",

            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

            "It\u2019s common to get a minor cut while flipping through a magazine or book. But tissue paper is not likely to draw blood. Now, scientists have explained the physics behind why some paper is more likely to slice through skin.",
            "Physicist Kaare Jensen was part of a team that set up experiments to study this. They used a gelatin replica of human tissue. Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",
            "The most treacherous paper tested was the kind used in old-fashioned dot matrix printers. Good news for fingers everywhere: That paper isn\u2019t used much anymore. Magazine paper ranked a close second in the scientists\u2019 tests.",
            "The slicing angle also mattered. Pressing the paper\u2019s edge straight down into the gelatin was less likely to cause a cut than if the paper\u2019s path angled across and down.",
            "Next, the researchers put paper\u2019s slicing powers to use. They designed a 3-D printed tool they call the Papermachete. Loaded with a strip of printer paper, the tool becomes a single-use knife. The paper blade can cut into cucumber, pepper and apple. It can even cut chicken. The tool could be a low-cost option for prepping some foods.",
            "Next, the researchers plan to study more realistic, finger-shaped materials, rather than flat sheets of gelatin, says Jensen.",

In this science project, you will study a simple example of the last type of instrument: a narrow-necked bottle partially filled with water.",
            "How do musical instruments make the sounds that they do? All sound is made by vibrations. The vibrations push and pull on air molecules, changing the air pressure around them. The pushes cause a local compression of the air (increase in air pressure), and the pulls cause a local rarefaction of the air (decrease in air pressure). The compressions and rarefactions are rapidly transmitted through the air from the original source as a wave and are commonly called a sound wave. In summary, sound itself is a wave, a pattern, of changing air pressures.",

If you measured the changes in pressure and graphed the results, you could see how pressure changes over time, as shown in the bottom of Figure 1.

The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch. Technically, the\u00a0frequency\u00a0of a wave describes how many cycles of the wave happen during a certain amount of time. This is measured in\u00a0hertz, or cycles per second. On average, the frequency range for human hearing is from 20\u00a0hertz at the low end to 20,000\u00a0hertz at the high end. Figure 2 shows examples of sound waves of two different frequencies. The\u00a0period\u00a0in the wave is the time that it takes for a single cycle of the wave to pass.
