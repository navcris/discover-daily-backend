            "Narwhals summering in the Canadian High Arctic. Local members of this species appear were seen on video engaging in what appeared to be play.",
            "Narwhals wield their iconic tusks in surprising ways \u2014 possibly even to play with living \u201ctoys.\u201d",
            "Few scientists have seen these so-called unicorns of the sea brandishing their tusks in the wild. Past aerial video has shown the Arctic whales swinging their \u201chorns\u201d to tap fish prior to eating them. Now they\u2019ve been seen gingerly prodding and flipping a fish. These gentler movements may have been part of a play session, researchers report.",
            "This is the first report of narwhals (Monodon monoceros) apparently sporting around for fun, says Greg O\u2019Corry-Crowe at Florida Atlantic University in Fort Pierce. A behavioral ecologist and geneticist, he headed the research team. His group shared its new findings February 28 in Frontiers in Marine Science.",
            "A narwhal\u2019s tusk is an elongated, spiraled tooth. It protrudes from the top lip of males (and some females). Males can grow to 5 meters (16 feet) long, with their tusks spanning another half their body length.",
            "Biologists suspect those tusks evolved so that males could show off or compete for mates. But past research has found they can offer other benefits, too. For instance, the tusks can sense changes in water temperature and salinity.",
            "Technologies involving genetics, satellite tagging, aerial counts and mapping have offered insights on these elusive whales. Still, they provided only snapshots of what these unusual animals do, says O\u2019Corry-Crowe.",

            "In this drone footage, narwhals prod, flip and guide a fish with their tusks, possibly playing with it.",
            "So he decided to try what he calls an \u201cold-style natural history and behavioral observation.\u201d But not totally old-style. His team enlisted a remotely operated flying drone. Then they spent hours in the summer of 2022 filming narwhals as they swam in an island bay in the Canadian High Arctic.",
            "One recording captured three narwhals chasing several Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), a type of fish. The whales sometimes swung their tusks like baseball bats to thwack fish \u2014 stunning them \u2014 before chowing down on them.",
            "Another recording showed three narwhals following a large char, with one whale taking the lead. It lightly nudged and flipped the fish with the tip or side of its tusk. In this way, it altered the fish\u2019s path. There\u2019s little evidence that narwhals normally eat much char. And winter, not summer, is their big dining season. So this video seems to show the whale and fish investigating one another.",
            "\u201cThere\u2019s this tentativeness,\u201d O\u2019Corry-Crowe explains. Then, he notes, the char \u201cmakes a dramatic movement.\u201d Afterward, the whale \u201cjust recoils and goes whoa!\u201d",
            "Moreover, he adds, that repeated tusk action \u2014 and the fact the whales didn\u2019t try to eat the fish \u2014 suggest the narwhals were just playing.",
            "Because of the Arctic\u2019s harsh environment, people often think creatures there are constantly fighting to survive, O\u2019Corry-Crowe says. But his team\u2019s new study hints that sometimes these animals have time to explore, and possibly play \u2014 at least during their \u201csummer vacation.\u201d",

With proper treatments, people with asthma can live normal lives.",
            "Asthma affects how air moves through the lungs.",
            "When you inhale, air flows from your mouth or nose through your windpipe and into your lungs. The windpipe is a bit like the trunk of a tree that splits into two branches, one leading to each lung. Within the lungs, these big branches split off into smaller and smaller branches.",
            "At the ends of the tiniest branches, where a tree\u2019s leaves would be, your lungs have small air sacs.\u00a0The walls of these balloon-like sacs are only one cell wide! Here, your blood sucks up oxygen from the air.\u00a0",

            "This sudden constriction causes an asthma attack. Triggers can include pollutants and other things in the environment, such as pet dander (flaked off bits of skin). Viruses that cause colds also can trigger attacks. Sometimes, even exercise can bring on an attack.",

            "Our immune system is like a large army of blood cells that protect the body. Some of those cells are general soldiers. Others work as snipers with specific targets. Still others act more like lookouts. They warn the rest of the army of incoming threats.",
            "Eosinophils (Ee-oh-SIN-uh-fils) are one type of lookout cell. In the lungs, eosinophils can send messages to recruit other immune cells to fight threats. But in some people with asthma, they work too aggressively. If overactive, they can recruit too many soldiers to the lungs. This can cause the airways to narrow.\u00a0",

            "Fortunately, narrow airways can be treated with asthma inhalers. These devices disperse medicine into the throat \u2014 usually as a very fine powder. As you inhale, this fine powder gets drawn into the smallest branches of the lungs. There, it can widen airways by relaxing muscles surrounding the lungs\u2019 branching tunnels.",
            "Inhalers can come in all different shapes and strengths of medication. \u201cNot everybody needs medication every day,\u201d says Cohen. \u201cSome people only need it sometimes.\u201d",
            "However, traditional inhalers may not be enough for people with severe asthma.",
            "To help these people, scientists have developed injectable medications over the past two decades. These shots are being prescribed to a small, but growing, number of people. Called biologics, these treatments work in a different way than the drugs in asthma inhalers. Instead of relaxing muscles, they act directly on the immune cells that trigger swelling. \u00a0",

            "Some biologics for asthma treat overactive eosinophils. They keep those cells from signaling other immune cells. Another biologic prevents target cells from receiving the eosinophils\u2019 signals. In each case, these therapies reduce how many immune cells move into the lungs. And fewer immune cells mean less swelling and easier breathing.",
            "Biologics can help prevent frequent asthma attacks, notes Khalilah Gates. She\u2019s a lung doctor at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, Ill.\u00a0People receiving biologics won\u2019t need to use an inhaler as much (though they may still need one from time to time).",
            "Biologics won\u2019t help everyone with severe asthma. \u201cMost of the biologics require a certain amount of eosinophils in the blood,\u201d says Gates. So, doctors may do a blood test to check for levels of these before prescribing biologics. But, she says, \u201cbiologics have really been helpful in a subset of people.\u201d",
            "Biologics helped one of Cohen\u2019s young patients with severe asthma. For years, this patient \u201ccould not go to the park, could not go to the playground and run around at all,\u201d she says. He ended up in the hospital multiple times a year.",

            "One downside is that biologics have to be given as a shot. They can\u2019t be given as a pill or inhaler. Most people get the shots once a month, though some must be given more frequently.",
            "In 2025, it is \u201cso exciting to be able to give really good asthma treatment for people, even if their asthma is severe,\u201d Cohen says.",

After that program, I did an internship in research. We could intern anywhere for one semester without having to take classes. I saw that as my chance to try research. We only had a few research options in Colombia. I interned at the Ohio State University and found that I loved working in the lab.",

Again, I didn\u2019t have a specific topic in mind. So I applied to all kinds of engineering programs in the U.S. I didn\u2019t get into any of them. Instead, I was accepted into an immunology program in Colombia.",

Physiology of hearing and deafness let me apply my physics and engineering background to biology. It\u2019s a really good fit for all of my interests. I didn\u2019t plan for it to happen like that. I just really loved learning. And that\u2019s what I still do with my job today.\u00a0",
            "During the first year of my PhD program, I had to rotate between four different labs from at least two different departments. I picked my labs based on which techniques I could learn. I saw it as an opportunity to do things I didn\u2019t often get to in immunology. One of those labs had us developing a fancy imaging technique for the inner ear.",

            "Nucleosynthesis is a process by which new atomic nuclei are made. This process created all the elements that make up our universe.",
            "Synthesis is a fancy word meaning to create something. So nucleosynthesis means nuclei are being created. In this case, the nuclei are inside atoms. That\u2019s a big deal because an atom\u2019s nucleus determines which element it is. By making new nuclei, nucleosynthesis makes different elements, too.",
            "Nucleosynthesis works in one of two ways. It can start with protons and neutrons (or something even smaller) and bind them into a nucleus. Or it can start with a few lighter nuclei and fuse them into a heavier one.",
            "An atom\u2019s nucleus contains protons and neutrons. An atom\u2019s atomic number \u2014 the number of protons it contains \u2014 determines the element\u2019s identity. For example, all helium atoms have two protons. Helium\u2019s atomic number is 2. If an atom has two protons, it\u2019s a helium atom. If, by some process, a helium atom gains two more protons, it will no longer be helium. It would now be beryllium.",
            "This process doesn\u2019t always change the element. If only the number of neutrons in a nucleus changes, the element stays the same. That\u2019s because the number of protons, not neutrons, determines the element type.",
            "Most nucleosynthesis occurs in the cosmos. It started with the Big Bang, which exploded our universe into being. As matter and space rapidly expanded from the Big Bang, particles started to group together. Some of those particles were protons and neutrons. And in joining them together, the Big Bang created atomic nuclei. Scientists believe that lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, came from nucleosynthesis during the Big Bang.",
            "Other elements have been forged inside stars. During its lifetime, a star fuses lighter nuclei \u2014 such as hydrogen and helium \u2014 into heavier ones. The extreme gravity in the star\u2019s core drives this process. This is called stellar nucleosynthesis. This is where much of the carbon, iron and other elements crucial for life originate.",
            "Even in death, stars can form new elements. When supermassive stars die, they don\u2019t just fade away. They explode as a supernova. This releases huge amounts of energy. Enough energy to fuse nuclei together and create new elements. Scientists believe supernova nucleosynthesis made much of the oxygen in our universe. Supernovas likely cooked up most of the elements heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium, too.",
            "Scientists used lasers to mimic stellar core processes of nucleosynthesis.",

Since the 1990s, planetary scientists have thought that Charon could have formed in a way similar to Earth\u2019s moon. Some impact on Pluto might have splashed out hot, molten material, which then began orbiting around it. Eventually that debris could have come together, forming a large moon.",
            "But, just as with Earth\u2019s moon, details of that possible scenario have been fuzzy. \u201cIt goes: Something hit Pluto,\u201d Denton says. Then \u201cquestion mark, question mark, question mark \u2014 Charon is now there.\u201d",
            "Past computer models of such collisions seemed to yield a system like Pluto and Charon. But those models treated the rocky, icy bodies as fluids. They ignored their material strength. And that would have been a decent assumption for large objects, such as gas giants or galaxies. When something hits them, those do behave like fluids. But Pluto and Charon are ice-wrapped rocks. And, it turns out, you can\u2019t ignore that.",
            "The real Charon-forming collision would have been a lot less splashy, Denton says. So in her team\u2019s models, the researchers included Pluto\u2019s and Charon\u2019s rocky cores and icy mantles and crusts. And then it turned out that the protoplanets had an instant connection.",

However, it periodically emits\u00a0clouds of opaque dust. They\u00a0create a cometlike tail that blocks a small share (less than 1 percent) of its host star\u2019s light.",

He was describing the planet January 14 at the meeting.",
            "Something in the dust emitted light that was hard to link to any specific material, he said. His team first checked to see if the dust grains were magnesium oxide and silicon monoxide. Those are what you\u2019d expect in mantle material. But the emitted light didn\u2019t fit these minerals.",

            "Those gases are hard to explain for a planet so close to its star. \u201cIt\u2019s just so weird and unexpected,\u201d Tusay said. In an attempt to learn more, he has requested more JWST observing time.",

            "At pressures above about 20,000 kilograms per square centimeter (285,466 pounds per square inch), ice smooshes into what\u2019s known as ice VII. It\u2019s densely packed molecules are ordered like the cubies in a Rubik\u2019s Cube. Ice VII has been found trapped in diamonds from Earth\u2019s mantle.

As they revolved, they broke hydrogen bonds that had held them to a neighbor. Then they quickly turn and bond with another, Bove explains. These jumpy rotations may make plastic ice more elastic than if its molecules rotated freely. It also may conduct heat better.",
            "Plastic ice VII may have existed early in the formation of not only Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, but also other icy moons in our solar system, such as Saturn\u2019s Titan, says Baptiste Journaux.

They didn\u2019t walk or fly there. Instead, forests moved over the course of many generations, through spreading seeds and new tree growth.",
            "\u201cThere are seeds, like acorns, that squirrels will pick up and move around,\u201d says Brandt. Think of Scrat dragging his prize acorn to the ends of the earth in Ice Age. Maple tree seeds are encased in tiny \u201chelicopters\u201d that help them soar with the wind. Berries contain seeds that birds eat and poop out. These features can spread seeds out in all directions. But seeds don\u2019t have equally good chances of growing in all places.",

            "fCWhile trees can\u2019t walk around on their roots, entire forests can migrate when the wind or birds or other animals move seeds to new places.",
            "As northern habitats got colder during ice ages, for instance, it was likely easier for seeds to thrive toward the warmer south. As a result, more new trees started growing on the southern edges of forests, while older trees up north died out. Slowly, forests migrated, moving around 100 to 500 meters (about 300 to 1,600 feet) a year, Brandt says.\u00a0",
            "But now, human-caused climate change is changing habitats faster than forests are prepared to move. Mangrove forests, which grow on seacoasts, are under threat from rising oceans. Warmer temperatures in Canada are making it difficult for white spruce to grow. And pinyon pines are struggling with drier climates in the American southwest.",
            "\u201cTrees just cannot keep up,\u201d says Brandt. \u201cTheir habitats are changing faster than they can migrate. So, humans are helping them out by moving them.\u201d",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "To give forests a leg up, some scientists are planting new seeds in areas with favorable conditions. This is called assisted migration. Sometimes, assisting migration can even mean replacing species that are no longer equipped to handle a changed landscape with species better suited to the new conditions.",
            "In Minnesota, Brandt is studying trees on the banks of the Mississippi River. The area is flooding more frequently and severely, and invasive beetles are destroying the forests. Floodplain trees like silver maples are dying and struggling to grow.",
            "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to replace the trees that are lost with those that are better adapted to the current climate,\u201d says Brandt. Planting trees that thrive near water, like cottonwoods and willows, could be part of the solution.",
            "Nearby, the Superior National Forest just created an assisted migration plan \u2014\u00a0a guidebook to help forest managers prepare for climate change. Because trees can hold cultural significance, the team has been working with scientists, Minnesota residents and local Indigenous tribes to make sure the forest migration plan aligns with community needs.",
            "Even though forests need to adapt in order to survive climate change, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to completely change the forest,\u201d Brandt says, because people \u201crely on those trees.\u201d"

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",
            "The mantle\u2019s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply.

He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",

            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it.

The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",

The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",

First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",

You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed.

So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",

            "Sundogs often contain a colorful, rainbowlike streak. That\u2019s because the sun\u2019s white light is made up of many different wavelengths, or colors of light. And those light waves bend at slightly different angles off ice crystals in the air. This separates incoming sunlight into the colors of the rainbow. But unlike a rainbow, which always has red on the outer edge, red appears on the inside of the sundog, closest to the sun. Blue appears on the outer edge of a sundog, farthest from the sun.",
            "Sundogs appear only when the sun is fairly low in the sky. When the sun climbs too high, sunlight doesn\u2019t hit the ice crystals at the right angles. Light can\u2019t refract in a way we can see, so sundogs disappear. Sundogs are most common at cold temperatures, but they can occur when it isn\u2019t freezing out. They can appear anywhere on Earth, as long as there are ice crystals in the atmosphere. This often happens with wispy, high-flying cirrostratus clouds. The appearance of those clouds can indicate that rain is on the way.",

            "Vampire bats live on a strictly blood-based diet. So strict, in fact, that they seem to process their food more like some blood-feeding flies than like other known mammals.",
            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",
            "Researchers shared these findings November 6 in\u00a0Biology Letters.",

            "Researchers put vampire bats through their paces on a mini treadmill to discover what fuels their metabolism.",
            "The discovery means the vampire bats power along much like blood-feeding tsetse flies or some mosquitoes. That\u2019s a first for mammals, thinks Ken Welch. He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often.",

A couple of smaller quakes followed shortly thereafter, in 1960. There likely also would have been smaller undetected temblors, Hough says.

            "Many of the reports Hough turned up seem to fit with a shaking that would have rated 2 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) scale. Scientists use this scale to rate quakes based on the damage they cause. An MMI of 2 is fairly weak. It would likely be \u201cfelt only by a few persons at rest,\u201d Hough says, \u201cespecially on upper floors of a building.\u201d",

            "Furuya imagines that robotic training could help people master many activities beyond piano keys. Pro gamers must practice complex keyboard or joystick motions. Surgeons have to learn complicated, delicate hand movements. And baseball pitchers need to master gripping the ball in a certain way. If a robot can help someone train these sorts of hand motions, Furuya says, maybe practice won\u2019t have to feel so repetitive. \u201cThey can use practice time for more creative activities,\u201d he says."

            "The levels of drugs used in the tests were high compared to what Mou\u2019s group has found in drinking-water sources. So she wonders how well the new method might work when levels are very low. Still, she can imagine that this new process might be particularly useful where levels of medicinal pollution might be high. Near hospitals is one example, or downstream of factories that make medicines.\u00a0"

If the hoop began toward the top of the cone, it would migrate up. Then it would be flung away. If the hoop started near the bottom, it would migrate down to the ground.",
            "Only a robot indented in the middle could keep a hoop steadily aloft.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "This showed how hoops stay up on robots. But with enough practice, people should be able to keep a Hula-Hoop spinning regardless of body shape.",
            "People can learn to adapt their gyrations based on the position of the hoop. Even the robots could learn this trick. The researchers got the cone-shaped robot to successfully hula-hoop by adjusting its rate of wiggling, depending on how high the hoop slid.",
            "The new findings offer hints for people learning to hula-hoop. First is how to launch their hoop. In the tests, a slow launch prevented robots from keeping the hoop up. So make sure to spin it fast.",
            "Positioning the hoop correctly also helps. In successful experiments, the hoop lined up with the robot\u2019s body so that the hoop and body always shifted in the same direction. Hula-hoopers should try to launch that way, too. If you start with your hips out to the right, start with the hoop out to the right. Then, swing the hoop around quickly. And start swiveling your hips in that same direction.",
            "A final tip gleaned from the research: Bigger hoops are good for beginners \u2014 they can be supported with slower gyrations."

            "The Firekeeper\u2019s Daughter, by Angeline Boulley, is largely a murder mystery. But when Ava Cummings, 18, read the book, she was most intrigued by the main character\u2019s interest in ethnobotany. (That\u2019s the study of how people in a certain culture or region use their local plants.) Like Ava, the lead character and author are Native American. This piqued Ava\u2019s interest in traditional Indigenous medicine.",
            "In fact, it would prompt her to study how well an Indigenous herb could treat STAC3 disorder. This genetic condition impairs muscle development and strength. It was first identified in Ava\u2019s Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. It also affects some family friends.",

            "Ava Cummings, 18, set out to discover the best treatment for STAC3 disorder \u2014 a muscle condition that affects members of her Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. ",
            "Ava\u2019s goal was to see how well a traditional herb might treat the condition compared with a modern drug. To find out, she ran an experiment with adult and larval fruit flies. All showed STAC3 symptoms.",
            "The teen treated some flies with the herb Urtica dioica. Other flies got the drug tirasemtiv. She treated a third bunch of flies with both. The herb alone did the best job of improving movement and how far fruit-fly larvae could travel. The herb alone and in combo with the drug did a better job of improving movement in the adult insects.",
            "Her findings shed light on ways Indigenous medicine may complement or even outperform modern drugs. Ava hopes her project will also boost awareness about diseases that affect small communities.",
            "Ava is currently a senior at the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Durham. Her research earned second place at the 2025 Regeneron Science Talent Search. (This competition is run by Society for Science, which also publishes Science News Explores). In this interview, Ava shares her research experiences and advice.",

            "Ava attended a meeting of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society. There, she got to meet many Indigenous professionals and spread awareness about STAC3. Some people she met had their own experiences with STAC3. Some were studying other population-specific diseases. \u201cBeing able to make those connections and relationships was really fun,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cMaking friends through it,\u201d Ava says. The research program at her school had 12 students. \u201cThat just really gave me a taste of what science is all about and what the scientific community is really capable of.\u201d Ava didn\u2019t just get to share what was going on with her own project. She got to learn about others\u2019 research, too. \u201cHaving those friends around for good humor and light-hearted conversation when things were getting difficult or challenging was also very good.\u201d",
            "Start \u201cwith baby steps,\u201d Ava says. \u201cI was very intimidated by seeing past projects that people had worked on. I would read their project titles, and I\u2019m like, \u2018I can\u2019t pronounce or even begin to think what any of these words mean.\u2019\u201d But she\u2019s gotten to see her own project grow over the past year from a small seed of curiosity. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna end up with this big discovery, big project overnight,\u201d she says.",
            "\u201cI would like to continue researching STAC3,\u201d Ava says. But she wants to study Indigenous medicine for other diseases, too. \u201cOne, for example, is called GA1, glutaric acidemia type 1,\u201d Ava says. \u201cThat\u2019s a liver disease that\u2019s also specific to my tribe.\u201d"
