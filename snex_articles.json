            "All kinds of animals have been caught chowing down on members of their own species. The practice seems especially widespread in invertebrates. But amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds have been known to make a meal out of their own kind, too.",
            "Some female spiders and insects famously eat their male partners when they mate. Black widows sometimes devour their smaller male mates. And female praying mantises bite off their partners\u2019 heads.",
            "Other animals occasionally eat their own kids. Some comb jellies snack on their young when food is scarce. And wild hamsters seem to develop a taste for their children when they lack key nutrients in their diets. On the flip side, some mamma insects and spiders allow their babies to devour them. That allows the newborns to start off life with a feast.",
            "There are also animals that eat their peers. Some amphibians, for instance, have two larval forms. One is normal. The other is a cannibal form. The cannibal larvae have bigger mouths and sharper teeth \u2014 the better for scarfing down other larvae with. And that\u2019s not even the most extreme form of peer-on-peer cannibalism. Some shark embryos eat their brothers and sisters while still in their mother\u2019s womb. Only the strongest embryo survives to be born.",
            "There are some risks to cannibalism. If an animal eats one of its own kind that died of disease, it risks getting that illness too. And if an animal gobbles up too many of its own offspring, that sort of defeats the point of reproducing. But for many animals, it\u2019s sometimes worth living in a spider-eat-spider or shark-eat-shark world.",

Seeds come in all colors, shapes and sizes, from a tiny poppy seed to a giant coconut. Each one is a factory that has everything it needs to start making another plant.",
            "Many plants produce flowers, which develop into fruits, beans or grains. The seeds of flowering plants are made up of three parts. There\u2019s the baby plant, or embryo. Then there\u2019s the endosperm. This is a packet of food the embryo will use as energy to grow until it has leaves and can make its own food. These two parts are encased inside a seed coat.

            "Seeds can sense when conditions are right to grow. There must be enough water and sunlight. The temperature must be just right, too. Then, the seed coat absorbs water, softens and cracks open. A tiny root called a radical grows down into the soil. The first shoot or stem \u2014 called a plumule \u2014 grows up toward the sunlight.",

            "Learn what it takes a seed to start growing, a process known as germination. It\u2019s a lot less than you probably realize.",
            "But how do roots and shoots know which direction to grow?",
            "Like us, plants sense gravity. The cells of their roots and shoots contain small packets of starch granules. Those packets are heavy, so they settle at the bottom of cells. That tells a plant which way is down, explains Anna Newman-Griffis. She studied plant biology and now teaches at Durham University in England.",
            "Root cells are programmed to grow down toward the pull of gravity. This is called positive gravitropism. Shoot cells have negative gravitropism. That tells them to grow upward, against the pull of gravity.",

            "Most plant growth takes place at the tips and along the sides of roots and shoots. These regions are called meristems. They have unspecialized cells \u2014 sometimes called stem cells. These can become any kind of cell a plant needs. For example, stem cells can make new epidermal cells for protection if a shoot is injured. Or they can become root cells to seek out water deeper in the soil. Plants use cues from inside and outside their body to know when cells should divide and what type of cells to make.",
            "Adding new cells can make a plant longer or thicker. They can build branches, flowers or leaves. They also build a plant\u2019s transport system. Its xylem carries water absorbed by roots throughout the plant. The system\u2019s phloem transports sugar, the plant\u2019s food.",
            "Like animals, plants need energy from food to grow. But plants don\u2019t eat, says Newman-Griffis. Instead, they make their own food through photosynthesis.",
            "Plants pull carbon dioxide, or CO2, from the air into their leaves through little openings called stomata. Chloroplasts inside a leaf cell absorb energy from the sun and use it to convert CO2 and water into sugar and molecules of oxygen. This oxygen returns to the air. The sugars power all the plant\u2019s cellular machinery. Sugars are also the building blocks for making new cells and tissues.",
            "Basically, Newman-Griffis says, \u201cThey\u2019re making giant trees out of air molecules.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/rEdOvBAtyYk?feature=oembed",
            "This video shows how a substantial part of plants are made from ingredients they pull out of the air.",
            "Plants need other nutrients to grow properly, too. The main ones are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Nitrogen helps make leaves and is important for photosynthesis. Phosphorus helps make roots, flowers, seeds and DNA. Potassium helps move water and nutrients through their tissues.",
            "Plant roots absorb these nutrients from the soil. They come from the breakdown of rocks and organic matter, such as dead plants and animals. All three nutrients are very common on Earth. But they exist in multiple forms, some of which plants can\u2019t use. For instance, most nitrogen exists as a gas. Microbes in the soil help convert this gas from the air into a form plants can use. This process is called nitrogen fixation.",
            "Like animal cells, plant cells divide to make new cells through a process known as mitosis. But they undertake one extra step that animals don\u2019t. In the final stage of cell division, plants build a wall around each cell. Plants don\u2019t have bones or shells. So these rigid walls protect the cells. They also give them support and structure.",
            "Plant growth differs from animal growth in another important way. Babies of most animals have a set body plan that already determines where the major parts of the body go, such as the head or a tail. Where its eyes sit on its head also tend to be fixed in advance. The same is true for how many limbs or appendages it will have and where they will emerge.",
            "Plants use more general body plans. Those plans help them look like other members of their species by following instructions from their DNA. For example, the leaves of maple trees develop characteristic pointed lobes. California poppies produce distinctive flowers with bright petals. And deer grass makes long, thin leaves, called blades, that grow in a clump and sway in the wind.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "But a plant\u2019s environment will shape its individual growth pattern and structure. Since plants can\u2019t travel, they need different ways to deal with challenges. For example, an animal may eat parts of them. New leaves or stems may now need to grow in a somewhat different spot to capture water or sunlight. Or to cope with lots of wind.",
            "Plants are constantly growing and adjusting their body plan, says Newman-Griffis. So, their structure may end up with funny twists, bends and turns.",
            "The larger a plant grows \u2014 and the longer it lives \u2014 the more carbon it will have trapped in its cells. Trapping carbon is called carbon sequestration. This important process reduces the amount of greenhouse gases that build up in the atmosphere. And that plays a role in helping control Earth\u2019s climate.",
            "*a_photo_from_the_ground_looking_up_into_the_canopy_of_an_old_growth_forest",
            "fCOld-growth forests are made of trees that have lived hundreds of years or more. These trees trap huge amounts of carbon in their tissues. That helps keep carbon \u2014 in the form of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change \u2014 from building up in the atmosphere. ",
            "The large trees in old-growth forests can live for hundreds or thousands of years. They will have trapped huge amounts of carbon in their giant bodies. Being able in this way to adapt their growth patterns and respond to challenges in their environment has helped trees become some of the oldest beings on Earth."

I investigated whether she could learn from my movements. \u00a0\u00a0My experiment used a clear box that held a piece of chicken. To open the box, Poppy had to pull a string. I glued a light switch next to the string that didn\u2019t power anything. Instead, it helped me see if Poppy would copy me.

First, geological clues are found by looking for pieces of the exploded, iron-rich meteorite or for glass that formed during the impact. Satellite imaging can be used to visualize crater formations that are beneath the Earth\u2019s surface or a body of water. Finally, chemical evidence is used to date the crater and find traces of elements that are more common in space than on our planet.",

To build an image, Midjourney predicts the most likely color of the next pixel or group of pixels, again and again.",

            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",
            "Sometimes, Dom hallucinated that creatures were walking or sitting on him. Other times, he heard screaming. He only saw something that one time, as a teenager.",
            "Sleep paralysis happens when the brain messes up the process of falling asleep or waking. Usually, you only start dreaming after you\u2019re fully asleep. And you stop dreaming before you waken.",
            "*A_sitting_woman_looks_down_at_her_dreaming_self",
            "fCWhile dreaming in REM sleep, the body is usually paralyzed, unable to act out the motions the dreamer might see herself performing. Sometimes, a person wakes up while still in this state. That can be terrifying.",
            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",
            "You don\u2019t have to experience sleep paralysis to sense things that aren\u2019t there. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",
            "*a_wall_with_three_bricks_that_look_like_they_have_faces",
            "fCCan you see the three faces in this image? Most people can easily find them. Most people also realize that they aren\u2019t real faces. They are an example of pareidolia.",
            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences. For example, \u201cDo you ever see things other people cannot?\u201d and \u201cDo you ever think that everyday things look abnormal to you?\u201d",

            "Next, the participants looked at 60 images of black and white noise. For a very brief moment, another image would flash in the center of the noise. Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/vJG698U2Mvo?feature=oembed",
            "This video was part of a famous 1999 study into inattentional blindness. While you watch it, count the number of times people in white shirts pass a basketball.",
            "Partway through the video, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the players. Did you see it? About half of all viewers who count passes while watching the video miss the gorilla completely.",
            "If you too missed the gorilla, you experienced inattentional blindness. You were likely in a state called absorption. That\u2019s when you are so focused on a task that you tune out everything else.",
            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",
            "*a_woman_sitting_on_a_chair_looking_at_a_ghost_twin_image_sitting_in_front_of_a_window",
            "fCThe seated woman longs for her dead twin. She may \u201cfeel\u201d her sister is trying to reach out to her, physically or mentally. But her brain is likely just misreading some sensory cues \u2014 such as soft air currents in the environment around her.",
            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Many students study by reading their notes and textbooks over and over again. Research studies show there are more effective ways to use your valuable study time.",
            "As a teen, Faria Sana often highlighted books with markers. \u201cThe colors were supposed to tell me different things.\u201d Later, she recalls, \u201cI had no idea what those highlighted texts were supposed to mean.\u201d",
            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",
            "Nate Kornell \u201cdefinitely did cram\u201d before big tests when he was a student. He\u2019s a psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",

            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",

            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",

The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements.

And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",

But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",

Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions.

            "Millions of Americans will be lining up to vote on November 8. Millions will also stay home. But scientists have insight into how to convince people to vote.",
            "Every two years, on the first Tuesday (after a Monday) in November, Americans should head to the polls to take part in a national election. Some important elections may take part in the off-years as well. But not everyone who is eligible to vote will do so. In fact, millions of people won\u2019t. And that\u2019s a problem because people who don\u2019t vote lose out on a prime chance to register their views. Also, voting isn\u2019t just important. It is a privilege and a right that many people throughout the world lack.",
            "One person\u2019s vote probably won\u2019t change course of an election. But a few thousand votes \u2014 or even a few hundred \u2014 certainly can. Consider, for instance, the famous election between George W. Bush and Al Gore in 2000. Once the polling was over, Florida had to recount its votes. In the end, Bush won by 537 votes. That difference decided who became president of the United States.",
            "Even in polling for local offices \u2014 such as a school board \u2014 the result of a vote can change everything from what schools neighborhood children will attend to whether their textbooks will cover evolution.",
            "There are many reasons why people don\u2019t vote.\u00a0And to counter the anger, apathy, fatigue and other factors that deter many folks from voting, organizations big and small mount campaigns urging people to go to the polls. Facebook users may plead with their friends. Politicians may hire phone banks to call thousands of people in states where a race appears to be very competitive. Celebrities may beg over YouTube. Does any of this really work?",
            "Political scientists have studied ways to change people\u2019s voting behavior. These four methods seem to stand out in terms of being most effective.",
            "1) Educate early and well\u00a0\u00a0 Messages that people receive early in life have a strong impact on whether people vote, notes Donald Green. He\u2019s a political scientist at Columbia University in New York City. Parents and teachers should therefore let kids know \u201cvoting is important,\u201d he argues. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes you a functioning adult.\u201d Teachers might help deliver this message in classes where students learn about how their country and government functions. That happened to me in high school when my own teacher one day begged me and my classmates to vote.",
            "People with college degrees are also more likely to vote. Perhaps society should make it easier for people to afford college. \u201cA person who gets a college education ends up in a different life circumstance,\u201d explains Barry Burden. He\u2019s a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. College graduates tend to associate more with people who vote \u2014 and then they vote, too. They also stand to earn more (paying more taxes), data have shown. So a more educated population should be a win-win for society.",
            "2) Peer pressure\u00a0 \u00a0A healthy dose of name and shame can have a big effect on Election Day. Green and his colleagues demonstrated this in a study published in 2008 in American Political Science Review. They applied a little social pressure to voters.",
            "Right before Michigan\u2019s 2006 Republican primary, the researchers selected a group of 180,000 potential voters. They mailed about 20,000 voters a letter asking them to do their \u201ccivic duty\u201d and vote. They mailed another 20,000 a different letter. It asked them to do their civic duty, but added that they were being studied \u2014 and that their votes were a matter of public record. (In some states, such as Michigan, voting records are publicly available after an election.) A third group got the same messages as the second group. But they also got a note that showed them their previous voting record, and the previous voting records of the people in their household. A fourth group got the same information as the third group, as well as being shown the publicly available voting records of their neighbors. The last 99,000 people or so were a control \u2014 they got no mailings at all.",
            "*350_inline_Voting2pngpng",
            "fCWhen many Americans vote on November 8, they will go into small, curtained stalls to keep their choices private.",
            "After all the votes were counted, the scientists saw a 1.8 percentage point increase in turnout by people who had been reminded to vote over those who did not get such a mailing. For the group told their votes were a matter of public record, there was a 2.5 percentage point increase. But the biggest increase were among those shown voting records. Turnout increased by 4.9 percentage points among people shown their previous voting records. And if voters were also shown their neighbors voting records, turnout at the polls rose a whopping 8.1 percentage points.",
            "Although shaming may get out the vote, Green cautions that it likely also burns bridges. \u201cI think it produces backlash,\u201d he says. In the 2008 study, many of the people who received the letter that showed the voting records of their neighbors called the number on the mailing and asked to be left alone.",
            "Peer pressure doesn\u2019t always have to be mean, though. Asking friends directly to pledge to vote \u2014 and then making sure they do \u2014 might be effective, Green says. The most effective thing to do, he says, may be to say to a close friend or coworker, \u201clet\u2019s walk to the polls together.\u201d",
            "3) Healthy competition\u00a0 \u201cPeople are going to participate when they think they are going to make a difference,\u201d says Eyal Winter. An economist, he works at the University of Leicester in England and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He notes that there is higher voter turnout when an election is close and there\u2019s no telling who might win. Winter compares elections to football or baseball games. When two close rivals face off, their competitions will draw much bigger crowds than when one team is sure to roll right over another. \u00a0",
            "To find out whether a close election might make more people vote than a race where one politician is far behind another, Winter and his colleague looked at U.S. elections for state governors from 1990 to 2005. When surveys before the election showed that results were likely to be very close, voter turnout increased. Why? People now felt their vote might make a bigger difference.",
            "More voters also turned out for the side with the slight majority in the poll. \u201cIt\u2019s nicer to support your team when you\u2019re expected to win,\u201d Winter explains. He and his colleague Esteban Klor \u2014 a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem \u2014 published their findings in 2006 on the Social Science Research Network.",
            "4) The personal touch\u00a0\u00a0 Hundreds of studies have been done on what gets people to vote. Some of the studies might be partisan \u2014 focusing on people who support a particular party. Others might focus on both major parties or even on people in general. Such research has probed everything from the how much money to spend on voicemail messages to crafting the ideal subject line for an email.",
            "Many of these ideas are described in Get out the Vote: How to increase voter turnout. This book was written by Green and his colleague Alan Gerber of Yale University in New Haven, Conn. The 2015 version of the book includes chapters on social media, mailing letters to people\u2019s houses and putting signs along highways. Letters and signs, computerized phone calls and Facebook posts all seem to help a little. But the most effective methods employ face-to-face and one-on-one discussions of the candidates, Green says. For politicians this means walking door to door (or having volunteers do it).",
            "But maybe someone just wants to get a sister or friend to vote. In that case, Green says the most effective message might be to convey your own enthusiasm for the candidates, the issues and how much you\u2019d like to see that person vote.",
            "Appealing directly to friends and family might help them get to the polls on Election Day. But keep in mind that everyone has their own opinions on the candidates. Even if you get your friends and family members to vote, they might not vote the way you\u2019d like them to."

Similarly, computers could compile lists of suspect articles for people to check, Kasprak says. Here, people would then be asked to offer the final assessment of what reads true.",

Sunlight and water vapor cause these chemicals to react in ways that generate chemicals such as sulfuric acid (H2SO4), a building block of tiny aerosol particles.

            "Climate change is expected to speed up stratospheric circulation. In the future, that could cause the stratosphere to poke into the troposphere more frequently. If it does, stratospheric intrusion may become even more important in forming new particles, Wang says.",

Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",

That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom.

Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",

            "Some musical instruments produce sound from vibrating strings, others from vibrating reeds and still others from resonating columns or cavities of air. In this science project, you will study a simple example of the last type of instrument: a narrow-necked bottle partially filled with water.",
            "How do musical instruments make the sounds that they do? All sound is made by vibrations. The vibrations push and pull on air molecules, changing the air pressure around them. The pushes cause a local compression of the air (increase in air pressure), and the pulls cause a local rarefaction of the air (decrease in air pressure). The compressions and rarefactions are rapidly transmitted through the air from the original source as a wave and are commonly called a sound wave. In summary, sound itself is a wave, a pattern, of changing air pressures.",

If you measured the changes in pressure and graphed the results, you could see how pressure changes over time, as shown in the bottom of Figure 1. The peaks in the graph correspond to the compressions, and the troughs correspond to the rarefactions.",

            "For a sound wave, the\u00a0frequency\u00a0of the wave is related to the perceived\u00a0pitch\u00a0or\u00a0musical note\u00a0of the sound. The higher the frequency, the higher the perceived pitch. Technically, the\u00a0frequency\u00a0of a wave describes how many cycles of the wave happen during a certain amount of time. This is measured in\u00a0hertz, or cycles per second. On average, the frequency range for human hearing is from 20\u00a0hertz at the low end to 20,000\u00a0hertz at the high end. Figure 2 shows examples of sound waves of two different frequencies. The\u00a0period\u00a0in the wave is the time that it takes for a single cycle of the wave to pass. (For more information on how sound waves make certain frequencies and\u00a0harmonics, check out the Science Buddies project idea\u00a0Do-Re-Mi with Straws.)",
            "Containers with an opening that is smaller than the width of the container are called\u00a0air cavities, also known as\u00a0Helmholtz resonators. Certain musical instruments, like ocarinas (Figure 3), are Helmholtz resonators. Note that Helmholtz resonators are different from\u00a0air columns, or containers where the opening is the same width as the rest of the container (similar to musical instruments like clarinets). The frequency of the sound wave generated by a Helmholtz resonator depends on the geometry of the opening (its area and length) as well as the volume of air inside the cavity. But what exactly is the relationship? In this science project, you will investigate how musical note frequency changes based on the volume of the empty space when producing notes by blowing over the top of a partially filled bottle.",

            "The heart beats steadily from long before you\u2019re born to the day you die. Triggering each beat (illustrated in background by an electrocardiogram line) is a zap of electricity \u2014 literally the pulse of life. ",
            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GMBSU-2GK3E?feature=oembed",
            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",

            "This animation shows the electrical signal, or action potential, coming from the heart\u2019s right sino-atrial node (at animation\u2019s top left). That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."

For some, this medicine provides relief. However, patients can suffer bad side effects from the drug. These include hallucinations and paranoia.",

Some studies have found it could help relieve some types of pain. But under U.S. law, cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug. That means the law doesn\u2019t recognize it as having any value in medicine and that it could harm people instead.",
            "Some people use cannabis for non-medical reasons. But recent studies suggest this could pose serious risks, especially for young people. Only about a third of teens think smoking marijuana a couple of times a week could be harmful. Yet, researchers find that cannabis use could impair a young person\u2019s brain development. And, among adults, studies have found brain damage in those who regularly use the drug.",

She\u2019s an environmental scientist in Canada at the University of Toronto. Our skin is thicker in some places, she explains, such as the soles of our feet. It\u2019s thinner in others, such as over our genitals. So absorption may differ greatly depending on where a PFAS touches the skin.",
