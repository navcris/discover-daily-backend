            "Taxonomy is the science of grouping living things into categories.",
            "This field involves two major tasks. One is to develop categories for living things. These categories are called taxa. Scientists develop taxa by looking at the similarities between life forms. The other part of this field is sorting living things into those groups.",
            "Scientists use a few methods to decide how to classify a living thing. One approach is comparing its features to those of life forms in different categories. Before technology existed to study DNA, biologists relied heavily on physical traits to make such calls. But today, DNA analysis allows for a more refined approach.",
            "The main taxonomic system used by scientists has eight levels. These levels are domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species.",
            "*_Scientists_Say_Taxonomy0",
            "fCThe eight levels of classification in taxonomy are nested within each other. For instance, the red fox\u2019s species name is Vulpes vulpes. This species is part of the family Canidae, which also includes dogs and wolves. This family is just one of the families in the order Carnivora, which are carnivorous mammals \u2014 and so on.",
            "Domain is the broadest group. All life on Earth belongs to one of three domains. Those are Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea. Life forms within each of the three domains belong to different kingdoms. Within each of those kingdoms, living things belong to different phyla, and so on. The most specific level of classification is species. Scientists have described millions of species that live today. And they expect that many more remain undiscovered.",
            "Taxonomy describes most species with a two-part name. This name is called a scientific name. The scientific name for humans is Homo sapiens. The first part \u2014 Homo \u2014 refers to our genus. No other living species belong to this genus. But some extinct species did. Homo erectus, for example, was an early human ancestor. Neandertals (Homo neanderthalensis) were also ancient human relatives.",
            "Taxonomy does more than just organize what we know about living things. It\u2019s also meant to reflect how life has evolved. Over time, different groups of living things have evolved from common ancestors. In that process, they split off into different branches in the tree of life. The more recently two groups of living things split off from each other, the more closely related they are. More closely related species share more taxa.",
            "Taxonomy experts have begun to update parts of the 250-year-old naming system for Earth\u2019s species.",

            "When someone is trapped in an avalanche, there is very little time before their oxygen supply runs out. A new safety device, though, can channel air to the buried person\u2019s face. It may extend their survival time in the snow, a new field trial shows. That could increase the chance of a successful rescue.",
            "The trial took place at a field site in northern Italy. There, participants were buried face down under 50 centimeters \u2014 about a foot and a half \u2014 of snow. The goal was to remain there safely for 35 minutes. No one in the group that was wearing the new safety device needed to be removed early due to low blood oxygen levels. Researchers reported the finding in the November 18 Journal of the American Medical Association.",
            "Minutes after being buried in an avalanche, someone\u2019s blood level of oxygen will begin to drop. At the same time, carbon dioxide level in the blood will climb. The chance the person will survive starts to drop after 10 minutes. Around two-thirds of people whose head and chest are trapped under snow will die of insufficient oxygen within 35 minutes.",
            "The new trial tested a safety device that\u2019s integrated into a backpack. It weighs a little over 500 grams, about 1.1 pounds. Called Safeback SBX, it runs on batteries that power a fan. That fan draws air from the surrounding snow, then directs it to the buried person\u2019s face from outlets in the backpack\u2019s shoulder straps.",
            "In the trial, researchers monitored participants\u2019 oxygen levels, heart and breathing rates and other health measures throughout the burial. The experiment ended if anyone\u2019s blood oxygen level got dangerously low \u2014 below 80 percent. This did not happen for the 12 people in the safety device group. Eleven remained buried for the full 35 minutes. One asked to be removed early due to unexpected skin irritation.",
            "In contrast, seven of the 12 using a fake device had to stop early because they fell below the blood-oxygen cutoff. Another four requested an early end. Three felt short of breath. One had a panic attack. Most people in the fake-device group remained buried between five and 13 minutes. Only one person in that group stayed under the snow for the full 35 minutes.",
            "Avalanches kill an average of 100 people in Europe each year, including skiers and mountain climbers. Avalanche deaths in the last several years in the United States have ranged from roughly one dozen to several dozen."

            "Many things can contribute to someone becoming nearsighted. Genetics play a big role. Daily habits matter too, such as how much time you spend staring at screens or whether you play outside. Even what you eat can affect vision.",

            "fCNormally, our eyes focus images on the retina, a layer of cells at the back of the eye (upper drawing). But with myopia, the eye instead focuses images a short distance in front of the retina (bottom image), causing faraway objects to appear blurred.",
            "His team used data from 29,971 elementary, middle and high school students in Tianjin, China. These data came from a survey on myopia. It asked kids or their families about the kids\u2019 age and sex, health history and family background. This survey also asked about their habits, including how much the kids slept, what they ate, their school environment and more.",
            "Shi\u2019s team also gathered environmental data for Tianjin. This ranged from air pollution to the amount of green space and nighttime lighting.",
            "To make sense of all these data, the researchers turned to machine learning. They trained this form of artificial intelligence (AI) to identify which aspects of the survey data seemed to have the strongest link to eye health. And levels of two air pollutants stood out: nitrogen dioxide gas and ultra-fine airborne particles. The AI model linked lower levels of both of these to better vision.",

It\u2019s possible, he says, that pollution causes narrowing of the blood vessels in the retina. That\u2019s the layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. \u201c[This] may lead to a greater risk of children becoming myopic.\u201d In fact, data have shown that elementary-school-age children are especially sensitive to air pollution.",

            "Imagine a dusty day. If there are a lot of particles in the air, they can get into our eyes and irritate them. Hurt or damaged cells will send out distress signals. This brings immune cells rushing to the area. It can trigger an increase in blood flow to the site, leaving it red and swollen. It might get itchy too. This is called inflammation.",
            "*three_kids_playing_outside_in_a_sunny_green_setting",
            "fCDoctors generally recommend getting plenty of outdoor time to limit your risk of myopia. Why? Your eyes get lots of exercise changing their focus to view things near and far. However, new data show, in polluted communities, outdoor air may also become a risk for nearsightedness, at least in kids.",
            "Oxidative stress can also develop, Klein-Seetharaman notes. This is when imbalances in certain chemicals damage affected cells. Both inflammation and oxidative stress can increase the risk of myopia.",
            "Inhaled pollutants can lead to more cell damage \u2014 and inflammation. From the lungs, pollutants can get into the blood and be transported throughout the body. This can affect every part of our body, including the eyes, the World Health Organization says.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s really complicated,\u201d Shi says. \u201cAnd there may be other [affected] pathways that we don\u2019t know very well yet.\u201d",
            "Shi\u2019s team also ran computer models that asked what would happen if children had been breathing and viewing the world through less polluted air. They predicted that fewer children would develop serious myopia.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The study shows how many different things affect eye health, Klein-Seetharaman says. However, correlation isn\u2019t causation, she adds. Just because two things happen at the same time doesn\u2019t mean one caused the other.\u00a0",
            "Shi agrees. \u201cI can say, generally speaking, improving air pollution would improve eyesight,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t say if you improve your air pollution level [by some particular amount], how much that will improve your eyesight.\u201d",
            "He notes other limitations, too. The study relied on self-reported data, which is not always accurate. The researchers also defined pollution exposures using data collected near the kids\u2019 schools. This approach isn\u2019t perfect because kids don\u2019t spend their entire day at school, much less weekends.",
            "This study, however, suggests some options for improving eye health. Since children spend a lot of time at school, the researchers recommend creating clean-air zones around schools. This might involve closing streets to cars during school drop-offs and pick-ups. Putting air purifiers in classrooms is another option.",
            "Such changes might work alongside local or regional pollution-fighting efforts, the researchers say. For kids everywhere, cleaner air could mean better vision, too.",

            "Scientists spotted this aquatic architecture in the Weddell Sea. Those waters, off the coast of Antarctica, are some of the coldest on Earth. The discovery shows that fish there plan where they group their nests. This helps them protect their eggs from predators.",
            "Researchers described the neatly arranged nests October 29 in Frontiers in Marine Science. The new findings add evidence that the Weddell Sea is home to complex ecosystems worth preserving.",

He\u2019s a fish biologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who did not take part in the new work. An international treaty currently protects Antarctica\u2019s resources. Still, some nations want to begin seabed mining or fishing in the Antarctic.",

Those waters had recently been exposed after a huge chunk of ice broke off from the shelf. The team dropped an underwater robot into the ocean to survey and film the seafloor more than 350 meters (about 1,150 feet) below.",
            "After the journey, Russ Connelly looked through the videos hoping to find something interesting. A marine biologist, he works at the University of Essex in Colchester, England. The footage revealed bowl-shaped dimples pressed into the soft seafloor. \u00a0As he looked closer, Connelly noticed those imprints formed perfect ovals and curves.",

Or that it was pockmarks from stones dropping from the ice and making craters.\u201d",
            "But the marks seemed just too evenly spread out to be either of those.",
            "The team then used its knowledge of creatures living nearby to figure out the true imprint artists. Those odd divots, they realized, must be fish nests made by yellowfin rockcod.",
            "The videos turned up more than 1,000 yellowfin rockcod nests. They were arranged in five repeating patterns: clusters, crescents, U-shapes, lines and ovals. A few nests stood alone.",
            "Most nests grouped into clusters, with several nests bunched closely.\u00a0Connelly suspects this layout offers smaller fish better protection against predators. Larger fish that fend for themselves might live in those bigger, solo nests.",
            "Other reasons may explain the nests\u2019 odd ordering, too, Connelly says. It\u2019s possible that many fish couples grouped their nests together for protection. But a single pair might have made the clustered ones. These fish might be building extra nests as decoys. More trips to the region are needed to confirm how many fish are using the nests, Connelly says.",
            "These are hardly the only fish nests to have grabbed attention recently in the Weddell Sea. Almost four years ago, researchers discovered its Antarctic seafloor was home to the world\u2019s largest known colony of breeding fish. This one community of icefish was nesting across a 92-square-mile area of the seabed.",
            "\u201cIn general, we need to explore more of the oceans, because \u2026 we\u2019re so surprised at every single time that we see life exists at these depths,\u201d Connelly says. \u201cWe need to see what\u2019s out there before species that we didn\u2019t even know existed have been lost.\u201d"

This tinkering kick-started her love of science.\u00a0\u00a0But Mack wouldn\u2019t come across her future career until she was about 10 years old.

They could even assemble themselves into \u201cmetamaterials.\u201d Such materials might interact with light or sound in new ways.",
            "But building the right types of nanoparticles for such jobs is no easy feat. Scientists must carefully craft the particles\u2019 surfaces. This controls how they will interact with each other and with other things. That\u2019s quite difficult when each particle is less than 100 nanometers across. That\u2019s just one-thousandth as thick as a typical sheet of paper!",
            "Nanoscientist Ahyoung Kim got her idea for this solution in a pottery class. Kim used handmade stencils to decorate her pieces. First, she drew a design on the ceramic pottery with wax. Then, she colored over the pot with ink. That ink stuck everywhere except where the wax was, leaving the design behind.",
            "Kim had been trying to find a way to decorate nanoparticles of gold.

            "Kim was part of a team that used chemicals to carefully stencil patterns on nanosize nuggets of gold. The gold bits were too small to draw on with wax. So she used something called iodide. When she mixed it with the nanobits, the iodide covered some parts of the gold, but left other areas exposed.",
            "Kim also added a material called 2-NAT. It stuck to the still-exposed gold surfaces, but not to areas covered with iodide. Finally, she \u201cpainted\u201d the gold nanobits with long, hair-like chemicals. A type of polymer, they clung to areas covered with 2-NAT, but not to areas covered with iodide. The iodide had acted like the wax stencil in her pottery class, limiting where the polymer \u201cpaint\u201d could stick.",
            "By changing the amounts of iodide and 2-NAT, the team could stencil nanoparticles with different designs. The shapes of the particles also affected those final designs.",
            "Computer models helped predict what the designs would look like with different recipes of gold, iodide and 2-NAT. These simulations also predicted how the gold bits would arrange themselves into larger structures. After running those models, the scientists whipped up more than 20 of the designs in the lab.",
            "This stenciling is \u201cpushing the frontiers of what\u2019s possible with nanocrystals and how they can be modified,\u201d says Sara Skrabalak.

            "Normally, gold nanobits cluster closely, like a stack of oranges at the grocery store. But with the polymer patches stenciled on, that changes. The polymers stick out from each gold bit, pushing other gold nanobits away. Instead of packing tightly, the stenciled gold bits pack more loosely. That could change some of their traits.",
            "For instance, it might change how they interact with light, says Maria Rosaria Plutino. She studies nanoscale materials at the Italian National Research Council in Messina. Rosaria Plutino did not take part in the new research. She does, however, study how tiny particles like these might work in fabrics, medicines and other applications.

            "It\u2019s the first time that AI has created an entire genome, says Brian Hie. And even though scientists debate whether viruses are alive or not, the work is a step toward using AI to design living things.",
            "Hie is a computational biologist at Stanford University in California. He\u2019s part of a team that shared its new findings September 17 on bioRxiv.org. (Studies posted to that site have not yet been vetted by other scientists.)",
            "In the past, AI models have been used to design individual genes and proteins. Creating an entire genome from scratch, however, adds a new layer of complexity. It requires many genes and proteins to team up.",
            "To try to create genomes for bacteria-killing viruses, Hie\u2019s team turned to two of its own AI models. These models had trained on billions of pairs of DNA\u2019s basic units \u2014 abbreviated A, C, G and T \u2014 from existing phage genomes. (This is similar to the way\u00a0ChatGPT has trained on the billions of letters in books and internet posts.)",
            "The researchers turned to a known bacteria-killing phage \u2014 \u03a6X174 \u2014 as a guide to help their AI design a similar genome. Scientists first read out the complete set of genetic instructions for \u03a6X174 in 1977. Its DNA is now very well known and studied. This meant the scientists could easily compare how phage genomes designed by AI differed from that of \u03a6X174, Hie explains.",
            "One reason his team decided to test their genome-designing AI on phages: They don\u2019t infect people. That means it was safe to work with them in the lab. The researchers also did not train their models on viruses known to cause disease. In this way, they made sure their AI wouldn\u2019t design viruses that might harm people.",
            "The two AI models came up with roughly 300 potential phage genomes. Of those, 16 produced viruses that could infect\u00a0E. coli. Some of them even killed\u00a0E. coli\u00a0faster than \u03a6X174 did.",
            "What\u2019s more, \u03a6X174 failed to kill three strains of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0on its own. But mixtures of AI-generated phages quickly evolved to take out even those bacteria.\u00a0",
            "The new findings suggest AI could help develop new\u00a0viruses for use in medicine. Indeed, such phages might offer a way to treat bacterial infections that no longer respond to antibiotics.",
            "\u201cThe need to find a phage that targets [such a \u2018superbug\u2019] strain would be very urgent,\u201d says Kimberly Davis. \u201cAI could be a powerful way of rapidly generating a phage match to treat patients.\u201d Davis is a microbiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Md. She did not take part in the AI genome work.",

            "Ideally, AI-made phages would not just kill one harmful type of bacteria, Hie says. They might also evolve to keep up with virus-resistant bacteria. Using AI to design entire organisms also could make microbes that speed up antibiotic production, Hie notes. Or they might allow the design of microbes to break down plastics.\u00a0",
            "AI may even help researchers make sense of genomes \u2014 and treat diseases \u2014 that are more complex than viral ones, Hie says. Our genome is more than half a million times the size of \u03a6X174\u2019s genome, he notes. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of work to go.\u201d",

            "He and his coworkers wanted to find out what about the cutting action matters most in determining how far onion-juice droplets fly. So they built a miniature guillotine, which allowed them to insert blades of varying sharpness. Then they attached sensors to measure the force and speed of each cut. The high-speed camera captured the spray of flying droplets emitted with each slice of a blade.",
            "Fluid-containing cells sit in each layer of an onion\u2019s skin. Every pass of the knife slices open these cells. Released juices then pool and press against the onion\u2019s skin. This pressure causes the juices to fly once the blade breaks through that skin.",
            "A blunt blade requires more force to break an onion\u2019s skin than a sharp one. That extra force squashes a greater number of cells, releasing more fluid.

            "It\u2019s not impossible for an asteroid to strike Earth during a person\u2019s lifetime. In fact, it\u2019s more likely than getting struck by lightning.",
            "Our solar system is peppered with large rocks, called asteroids. If a big asteroid plummets to Earth, there are many possible outcomes. The space rock could splash into the ocean and not harm anyone, for instance. Or it could wipe out a city. People have a hard time understanding the chances of an asteroid strike. So a team calculated the likelihood and compared it with other events \u2014 with some surprising results.",
            "\u201cIf a large or a medium asteroid were to hit the Earth, it would be something that almost everybody on the planet would be aware of,\u201d says Carrie Nugent. She\u2019s a planetary scientist at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass. While killer asteroids have hit before, such as the one that finished off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, Nugent says not to worry. \u201cWe try to put this event, which is actually a preventable event, in context with other preventable events.\u201d",
            "Nugent worked with six undergraduate students from Aalborg University in Denmark. Using a computer program, they simulated a group of asteroids similar to real near-Earth objects. They fed these modeled asteroids into a program called JPL Horizons. Anyone can use that program to look up predicted locations for objects in the solar system. For this project, the students determined whether each simulated asteroid would cross paths with Earth.",
            "That allowed the team to estimate the frequency of asteroids bigger than 140 meters (460 feet) across. That\u2019s around the size of a small cruise ship, Nugent says. An asteroid of this size would hit Earth roughly every 11,000 years. The researchers shared their findings August 12 in the Planetary Science Journal.",
            "That number is still pretty hard to understand. So Nugent compared the chances of an asteroid hitting Earth with other events that people may experience. The chances of being alive during an asteroid strike, she found, are higher than that of being struck by lightning. But a person is more likely to die in a car crash.",
            "Some events were rare but deadly. People \u2014 kids in particular \u2014 can die in dry sand hole collapses. This can happen when someone digs a large hole in sand, often at the beach. That hole can fall in on itself and take its digger down with it. \u201cIt is an extremely rare cause of death that most people don\u2019t even know about,\u201d Nugent says.",
            "Books and movies often portray asteroid run-ins as unstoppable events. \u201cThe truth is actually entirely the opposite,\u201d she says. NASA\u2019s DART Mission in 2022, for instance, bopped an asteroid that wasn\u2019t in danger of hitting Earth. The test changed the asteroid\u2019s path. This showed that people might be able to do this one day with a rock headed for our planet and avert a collision. So, Nugent says, it\u2019s important to do research, such as sky surveys, that locate these objects. \u201cThis is the one natural disaster we can totally prevent,\u201d she says.",
            "Nugent\u2019s team calculated the chances of near-Earth object (NEO), such as asteroids, hitting Earth in a person\u2019s lifetime. They compared this with the likelihood of other preventable events. The chance of an asteroid hitting the Earth is shown by the blue marker. The chance of such an asteroid killing a person is shown by the vertical blue bar.",
            "The graph is presented on a logarithmic scale. That means each grid line differs by a factor of ten from the one next to it. The x-axis gives the one-in-X chance that an event happens to an individual or the planet. For instance, the chance of being hit by lightning is 1-in-11,000. The y-axis gives the one-in-Y chance that a person dies if the event happens. So someone hit by lightning has a 1-in-10 chance of dying.",
            "Unlike most graphs, the label numbers on the x-axis get smaller moving to the right. And on the y-axis, they get smaller going up. This is because a one-in-X number is like a fraction with \u201c1\u201d on top and the \u201cX\u201d number on the bottom. The bigger the label number on these axes, the smaller the likelihood of that event happening.",

            "Slippery ice is something most of us have encountered, whether it\u2019s been under our boots, car tires or skates. But why ice is so slick has puzzled scientists for centuries. Now researchers in Germany offer a new explanation. They show ice can melt slightly with no heat added. It\u2019s due to molecular-level changes that disrupt the crystal structure of ice.\u00a0",
            "For hundreds of years, people have tried to understand why ice is slippery. In the 1850s, Michael Faraday performed a now-famous experiment. This chemist and physicist showed that if you placed two ice cubes atop one another, eventually they\u2019d lock together. Each had been coated in a thin layer of water, he explained. And that water froze when the cubes touched.",
            "This didn\u2019t show, however, why ice was covered in that thin layer of water.",
            "A few years later, an engineer named James Thomson offered an explanation. Pressure, like heat, can melt ice. Using math, he showed that the pressure from a boot, say, or skate blade could melt a small amount of the ice. That could form the thin layer of water.",
            "But there was a problem with this explanation.",
            "The pressure from a boot wouldn\u2019t melt enough water for the ice to turn slippery. You\u2019d need to concentrate all of someone\u2019s weight on a very small area to do that. How small? About the size of a poppy seed.",
            "Almost a century later, in 1939, a pair of physical chemists came up with another idea. Pressure and heat together could melt ice to create a slippery layer of water, they suggested. This heat could develop from the friction of a boot or other object\u00a0traveling over the ice.",
            "But even this explanation fell short. Why? Ice remains slippery even at sub-freezing temps. And so the slick mystery persisted.",
            "In 2024, researchers at Peking University in Beijing, China, explained why some of the water layer forms. Tiny defects in the surface of ice, they found, can create a thin layer of water on top of it. In fact, notes Martin M\u00fcser, that team showed that \u201ceven at an extremely cold temperature, there is some initial water on the surface.\u201d However, M\u00fcser argues, that water layer is not thick enough to make ice truly slippery.",
            "M\u00fcser\u2019s team at Saarland University in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, now offers a different, but related, explanation. To figure it out, these materials scientists modeled what happens to ice at the molecular level.",

Then they watched how properties of its molecules would change when the model had a sheet of ice touch another surface (such as a boot, tire or skate).",
            "Water is a dipole molecule. That means one side has a slight negative electric charge; the other side is positively charged. That charge separation makes the molecules in ice line up in a regular structure \u2014 like little magnets.",
            "*a_molecular_structure_of_crystalline_ice",
            "fCThe crystal structure of ice is made up of a lattice of highly ordered water molecules, each with two hydrogen atoms (white) bonded to an oxygen atom (red). ",
            "Yet it doesn\u2019t take much to disrupt that ordered structure. Imagine a boot touching the ice. Dipoles within the boot itself will attract dipoles in the top layers of the ice. It\u2019s like two magnets attracting one another.",
            "As the boot moves, the dipoles in the ice move, too. Now the perfect crystal structure of ice begins to fall apart as more and more of its molecules step out of line.",
            "This process is called frustration, says M\u00fcser. The ice \u201ckind of melts without really heating.\u201d",
            "The molecular changes shown by the new simulations would be virtually impossible to physically observe, the researchers note.",
            "M\u00fcser likens crystalline ice to \u201can ordered bed of shell pasta.\u201d Imagine, he says, what would happen if \u201cnow you rub over it with a slightly sticky hand.\u201d Some shells will get pulled out of order. The dipoles in the boot or tire provide a similar stickiness to pull ice molecules out of order.",
            "The affected molecules no longer behave like a crystal. Instead, they become that thin layer of water atop the ice.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "This is not the traditional way ice melts. It usually melts due to pressure or heat. But in this case, solid ice changes into liquid water as defects mess up its crystal structure.",
            "\u201cThis means ice can be slippery even at low temperatures,\u201d says Lars Pastewka. He\u2019s a microsystems engineer at the University of Freiburg in Germany. Indeed, the Saarland computer model shows that \u201cfrustrated\u201d ice will remain slippery at 10 kelvins. That\u2019s \u2013442\u00ba Fahrenheit, or close to absolute zero.",
            "\u201cMolecular simulations like these have the power to show what every atom is doing,\u201d says Robert Carpick. That \u201cis why [this new model\u2019s] results should be taken seriously.\u201d A mechanical engineer, Carpick works at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.",
            "Pastewka\u2019s group has shown similar crystal defects in silicon and diamond. This can turn their surfaces slippery, too. Diamond has one critical difference, though. With water ice, \u201cthe harder you push, the easier it gets to turn it into a liquid-like goo,\u201d Pastewka says. In diamond, you get the opposite effect \u2014 which actually protects the surface.",
            "In theory, you could skate on diamond for the same reason you can on water ice. But you wouldn\u2019t leave as many marks on the surface of a diamond rink.",
            "So what\u2019s the solution to keep you from slipping on ice in winter? \u201cI would say, put on cleats,\u201d says M\u00fcser. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only way.\u201d",

            "Polar bears are picky eaters. And that\u2019s great news for other hungry Arctic critters.",
            "In one year, a polar bear can leave roughly 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of scraps behind on which other animals can dine. Altogether, that comes to an estimated 7.6 million kilograms (8,375 U.S. tons) of bear leftovers, researchers now estimate.",
            "This leftover meat, called carrion, points to the crucial role these bears \u2014 top predators \u2014 play in feeding other species.",
            "The research also sounds a warning. As climate change warms the Arctic, polar bears are at risk. A decline in their numbers could greatly threaten other species that are part of the Arctic food web.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Polar bears eat mainly seals, especially ringed seals. Scientists have long known these bears mostly eat the blubber of their prey. These diners often leave much of the rest behind. Until now, scientists have overlooked the size of those leftovers and their importance, says Nicholas Pilfold, A large-carnivore biologist, Pilfold works at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance in California. He has done research in the Arctic for 15 years.",
            "As part of a team, Pilfold pored over studies, observations and anecdotes about scavenging activity around carcasses. These data went back as far as the 1930s. The researchers also analyzed studies on how many calories seals can provide. Then they also looked at studies that had tallied how many seals a polar bear consumes each year.",
            "During its hunting season peak, they found, a bear kills roughly one seal every three to five days. That comes to some 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) of prey each year. A bear eats about 70 percent of that mass. The remaining 30 percent is up for grabs.",
            "Today\u2019s Arctic hosts an estimated 26,000 polar bears. So all those leftovers add up to millions of kilograms \u2014 thousands of tons \u2014 of food for scavengers.",

            "Pilfold has seen that \u201cfoxes will follow in the tracks of where the polar bears have gone,\u201d waiting for the bears to abandon their meal. Birds also fly overhead, waiting their turn, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s just this cacophony of sound of gulls,\u201d he notes. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to get some of that seal.\u201d",
            "Other species couldn\u2019t access this type of food if the polar bears hadn\u2019t left it behind, says study coauthor Holly Gamblin. She is a wildlife biologist in Canada at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.",
            "The new findings don\u2019t surprise Jon Aars. A polar bear expert, he works at the Norwegian Polar Institute in Troms\u00f8. Bear leftovers are probably a \u201crather important\u201d food source for other species, he says \u2014 \u201cparticularly at a time of the year when alternative food is not so easy to get.\u201d",
            "Polar bears often swim to find seals at sea or on ice floes. As the Arctic has been warming, the ice has been melting, too. This gives bears fewer rest stops to catch their meals, dine and rest. Earlier work by Pilfold\u2019s team showed that the bears often have to swim exhaustingly long distances between meals. They tracked one female who swam 400 kilometers (249 miles) nonstop over a period of nine days.",
            "Such long treks are weakening bears and have led some to starve. This can reduce polar bear populations. If this happens, the carrion they provide will likely decrease as well, Pilfold now says.",
            "His team looked at two regions where polar bears have been declining. Here, they calculate, about 323,000 kilograms (710,000 pounds) of carrion are likely being lost each year. Melting ice might also make it harder for some scavengers to reach bear leftovers.",
            "It\u2019s hard to predict how reduced leftovers might affect other species, Aars says. But \u201cit will have [an] impact one way or another.\u201d And how big an impact, he says, will depend on the species and which \u201cpart of the Arctic we look at.\u201d"

            "This past January, a report of \u201cfamily trouble\u201d had brought police to the girl\u2019s home in Rochester, N.Y. Officers told her to get into a police car. Instead, she sank into the snow. As she screamed on the ground, an officer clamped handcuffs on her wrists. Police pushed the crying girl partly into the car. But she wouldn\u2019t lift her legs inside. Another officer then squirted her in the face with pepper spray.",
            "In February 2021, police arrested a 13-year-old Black boy in Baton Rouge, La. The officer restrained the teen by locking his arm around the child\u2019s neck. He relaxed the hold only after a bystander called out, \u201cYou\u2019re choking him!\u201d And in March 2021, police killed a 13-year-old Latino boy in Chicago, Ill. The boy was raising his hands when he was shot.",
            "New studies show that compared to their white peers, children and teens of color are more likely to be harmed by police. Research has also linked such differences in policing of young people to higher risks of mental-health problems later on.",
            "From 2003 to 2018 in the United States, 140 12- to 17-year-olds died in police encounters. All but nine of those children had been shot by the police. During the same period, police killed about 6,500 adults in the United States. Compared to their numbers in the population, Hispanic teens were nearly three times more likely to be shot and killed by police than were white teens. Among Black teens, the risk of being shot and killed by police was about six times that of white teens. Researchers shared those findings in the December 2020 Pediatrics.",
            "Hospital data also point to kids\u2019 unequal risk of being wounded by police. Kriszta Farkas is an epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley. She studies factors leading to inequalities in health. Recently, she and others analyzed hospital data for California from January 2005 to December 2017. They found 15,967 cases where youths up to age 19 had been harmed during contact with law enforcement.",
            "\u201cBoys are more likely to be physically hurt by police than girls\u201d \u2014 about seven times more likely, Farkas says. The highest rate of injuries was among 15- to 19-year-olds. In that group, Black boys were roughly 3.5 times more likely to be harmed than white boys.",
            "Police were less likely to injure younger teens and tweens than older youth. However, racial disparities were greater in the younger 10- to 14-year-old group. Here, the risk of harm from police was 5.3 times higher for Black boys than white boys, \u00a0",
            "Although boys were more likely to be harmed, Farkas found that there were larger racial inequities among girls, especially younger ones. Indeed, the new study shows that \u201cBlack girls are uniquely harmed by policing,\u201d Farkas says. For instance, Black girls aged 15 to 19 were more than 4.3 times as likely to be hurt by police as were white girls of the same age. And among kids aged 10 to 14, Black girls were 6.7 times as likely to be hurt by police as white girls. Overall, white girls reported far fewer injuries from law enforcement than any other group.",

            "Results from that study are \u201cnot surprising to those who have these lived experiences,\u201d says Dominique Johnson. Based in New York City, she worked on community engagement with the Center for Policing Equity. Today she works with AMC Networks. As a child she found that others judged Black people like her differently. White children did not have that burden, she said.",
            "Black teens can feel especially vulnerable when they are dehumanized because of their race, Johnson says. That happens when they are treated as if they don\u2019t deserve dignity or respect.",
            "Monique Jindal is a pediatrician at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She and others reviewed 29 studies on police contact with Black youth. Some studies found links between experiences with police and mental-health problems. Many young people said they felt unsafe, stressed out, angry, sad or depressed. In several studies, Black youths said they felt hopeless, fearful or unable to just be kids. The team shared its report, too, in the September 7 JAMA Pediatrics.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a very harsh reality for children of color,\u201d Jindal says. From a young age, Black children come into contact with police in parks, schools, neighborhoods and elsewhere. Yet \u201ckids are going through critical development periods during this time,\u201d she explains. Healthy development calls for children to feel safe. They need to feel they belong.",
            "Unfortunately, Jindal says, Black children often learn, \u201cthere\u2019s this social institution that is not there to protect them \u2014 that may actually do them harm.\u201d That can affect a child\u2019s view of society and the world. It can also mess with their ability to just be a kid. They may worry that police will see them as being up to no good, for example, instead of just hanging out with friends. Or they may avoid places, such as a park, because they don\u2019t want to be hassled by police.",

            "In general, police are less likely to use force against children, compared to adults of the same race, Goff says. But data from nine cities show that is less true for Black children than for white children. In addition, police were more likely to use force against Black children than against white adults.",
            "\u201cIn these nine cities, whiteness is more protective than childhood,\u201d Goff says.",
            "In an earlier study, a group of mostly white participants saw Black children over age 10 as less innocent than non-Black children in the same age group. And police were more likely to estimate higher ages for Black and Latino children, compared to white children.",
            "\u201cIn the research world, we call this being \u2018adultified,\u2019\u201d says Farkas, who did not work on that study. \u201cBut another way of thinking about it is not being allowed by the world around you to live your life as the carefree child or young person that you should be.\u201d",
            "Farkas says her group\u2019s work adds to \u201cscientific evidence on policing as a form of structural racism.\u201d That term, she adds, refers to \u201cthe patterns and practices that a society uses to give rise to and support racial discrimination.\u201d In this case, she says, \u201cpolicing unjustly, or unfairly, shapes the lives of Black children and teenagers in negative ways, compared to white youth.\u201d",
            "\u201cPeople in different racial groups are no more or less likely to break laws,\u201d explains epidemiologist Catherine Duarte. Yet people in racial minority groups \u201care more likely to experience police contact.\u201d And that can lead to more risk of harm. Duarte worked on the study with Farkas at UC Berkeley. She teaches at Stanford University in California.",
            "In a separate study, Duarte and others looked at how public policy shapes young people\u2019s contacts with police. Some policies affect whether there\u2019s a police presence at schools. Other policies deal with policing in different neighborhoods. Still other policies shape police contacts with young people who don\u2019t have stable housing. Various laws have also increased funding for police but not social services. Other laws expanded the crimes young people may be charged with.",
            "Also, many laws that don\u2019t seem to discriminate end up being applied more harshly against children of color than against white children, Duarte says. For example, police are more likely to stop children of color than white children. And such police stops are often less intrusive when they involve white children. The group shared its findings in the American Journal of Public Health in September 2020.",
            "\u201cIn public health research, we find that all of this is linked to worse health,\u201d Duarte says. That\u2019s especially true for people in minority groups who experience racism. Unjust differences in health are a sign of basic problems in our social systems, and we all have a responsibility to address them, she says. \u201cEveryone,\u201d she notes, \u201cshould have the opportunity to live healthful lives.\u201d",

            "Adds Jindal, \u201cHopefully people are waking up, and they are starting to really look at the ways that we have not protected children.\u201d She encourages youths who are not in a minority group to ask trusted adults what can be done to change things. And she hopes young people will have empathy for friends and classmates with different racial identities.",
            "Teens and tweens of color also should share their experiences with the adults in their lives who love and care about them, Jindal says. If they have negative experiences with police or others, \u201cthey should find someone they trust to talk about it.\u201d That could be a parent, teacher, doctor or someone else.",

            "Other work suggests that plants can learn and even remember. One famous study in 2014 used a plant called Mimosa pudica. Known for being \u201csensitive,\u201d it curls its leaves when it\u2019s disturbed.",
            "The researchers potted up dozens of these plants. Then they dropped each Mimosa 60 times in a row. The plants weren\u2019t harmed by the drop. It was short, with a soft landing. And they curled their leaves \u2014 but only the first few times. Pretty quickly, they stopped reacting.",

But many of the routines might be more harmful than helpful, a new study shows. The majority of the regimens shown are costly, have harmful ingredients and lack sunscreen. Most don\u2019t offer benefits for young skin. And they may lead to skin damage.",

            "The most common of these ingredients were alpha-hydroxy acids. These chemicals exfoliate skin, removing surface layers. They\u2019re common in anti-aging products because they can smooth fine lines and wrinkles and improve skin texture. They\u2019re also used in some products to prevent acne. But they can irritate and damage young skin.",
            "Creators used products with alpha-hydroxy acids an average of three times per video and as many as seven times in one regimen. This is harmful because the chemical becomes more irritating the more you layer it.",
            "Alpha-hydroxy acids also increase the skin\u2019s sensitivity to the sun. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends staying out of the sun and using sunscreen with these products. But on average, only 26 percent of the TikTok videos included any type of sun protection. So these regimens would boost the risk of sunburn and other sun damage.",

            "The majority of content creators they viewed had light skin. But since TikTok\u2019s feed is driven by an algorithm, the researchers don\u2019t know how well what they saw reflects the whole platform.

            "A handheld 3-D printer might someday print bone grafts directly onto fractures. Researchers prototyped the idea with a modified glue gun. They included antibiotics in the material to ease healing.",
            "A repurposed glue gun has helped repair broken bones in rabbits. Instead of a regular glue stick, it melts a material that helps bones heal.",
            "Some breaks in bones need a little help to mend. So surgeons sometimes take a bit of bone from elsewhere in the body to make a patch called a graft. Or they can use a synthetic \u2014 human-made \u2014 material that mimics bone.",
            "Synthetic grafts are often 3-D printed. Usually, X-ray scans and measurements of injuries are needed to make sure the graft will fit just right. Designing and making the graft takes time and can delay repairs.",
            "But the glue gun method doesn\u2019t require images of the fracture. And it doesn\u2019t need any special graft design. The handheld device can simply squirt the graft material right onto a break. ",
            "The idea was to design a printing system that could be easily used in operating rooms, says Jung Seung Lee. He\u2019s a biomedical engineer at Sungkyunkwan University. That\u2019s in Seoul, South Korea. Compared with regular bone grafts, he says, this system can save time, cost and complex procedures.",
            "The printing device holds sticks of a specially made \u201cbioink.\u201d It\u2019s safe to use in the body. It consists of two compounds commonly used for 3-D printing implants. One, hydroxyapatite, is a mineral found in bones. The other is a body-safe plastic called polycaprolactone, or PCL. That\u2019s included to support new bone as it grows. In an implant, it \u201cgradually degrades in our body over months,\u201d Lee says. Over time, newly grown bone will fill in as the graft breaks down.",
            "The ratio of the two compounds in the bioink determines the material\u2019s strength and stiffness. So the researchers can tailor the mixture for each use. They also added antibiotics into the bioink to prevent infections.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Like the glue sticks used for crafting, the bioink fits in the handheld printer. It can be squeezed out where it\u2019s needed. But regular hot glue guns work at temperatures far too high for living tissues.",
            "So the researchers modified their glue gun to work at lower temperatures. They also adjusted the tip for better control. Thanks to the low melting point of PCL, the bioink can be applied at about 60\u00b0 Celsius (140\u00b0 Fahrenheit). It cools to body temperature within 40 seconds. The whole process takes just a few minutes.",
            "Lee\u2019s team tested the printer and bioink on broken leg bones in rabbits. Another set of rabbits got a material called bone cement, which is used to attach implants to bones. The rabbits that got the bioink had better healing and regrowth of bone tissue. And the animals showed no signs of infection during the 12 weeks after surgery. The team shared its results September 5 in Device.",
            "For now, the printer is still a proof-of-concept for people. Lee aims to develop it into a multi-use printing system. For instance, it might apply chemicals that promote healing during surgeries. But first, researchers will have to do more studies to make sure the technology is safe. They\u2019ll also need to figure out how to disinfect the device between uses.",
            "There may be other limitations. \u201cThe high temperature of the extruded material is likely to stress or kill the cells,\u201d says Deborah Mason. She\u2019s a molecular and cell biologist at Cardiff University in Wales. She wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Lee\u2019s team is working to modify the tip of the device. That could help the bioink cool more quickly after extrusion.",
            "In the future, this sort of device could help surgeons with more complex repairs, suggests Nieves Cubo-Mateo. She\u2019s a biomaterials engineer at Nebrija University in Madrid, Spain. She wasn\u2019t part of the study.",
            "But there is a long way to go for that to happen, she says. The printer would need to work with other tools that surgeons use. Those include imaging technologies and robotic devices used during surgeries. That would take the new device beyond just a \u201cdefect-filler,\u201d she says. Someday, it could be a \u201cbone printer pen\u201d useful for many types of surgeries.",

            "When stressed by heat, trees release chemicals. These can mix with molecules from car exhaust to make toxic air pollutants. And this can happen even where you can\u2019t smell any car exhaust. Atmospheric chemists at Texas A&M University in College Station shared their new findings here, on August 18, at the American Chemical Society fall meeting.",
            "People expect to find air pollution in and around cities. There, vehicles cough pollutants out of their tailpipes. But at Texas A&M, \u201cthe air smells beautiful,\u201d says Renyi Zhang. The campus is about 100 miles away from the closest big city. Here, he notes, the air is usually safe to breathe.",
            "But that may not be true during heat waves. Zhang\u2019s team collected data on campus. During a month-long event in August 2024, daytime temps hit 32\u02da to 41\u02da Celsius (90\u02da to 106\u02da Fahrenheit). And it wasn\u2019t just the heat that made these days uncomfortable. Pollution ramped up, too. Levels of lung-irritating ozone got especially high. It rose nearly to a level deemed hazardous to breathe.",

            "Bianca Aridjis-Olivos, a graduate student in his lab, set up air-monitoring equipment atop the university\u2019s meteorology building. It\u2019s surrounded by grand oak trees. It seemed a good location. It\u2019s high above passing cars and other expected pollution sources.",
            "The instruments she used are \u201clike a super-sensitive nose,\u201d she notes. By changing how they operate, she could alter \u201cwhat scents the nose could detect.\u201d Besides ozone, they could pick up nitrogen oxides from combustion (including gasoline-powered vehicles).",
            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

            "Learn why isoprene \u2014 a chemical released by trees (and lots of other plants) \u2014 can make air pollution worse. It\u2019s the second most widely emitted volatile organic chemical (after methane) in the world. The chemistry explained here underlies the data reported in the new study.",
            "Once all her equipment was ready, Aridjis-Olivos waited for the next heat wave.",
            "It hit in August 2024. From August 5 to September 3, she sampled different gases and particles from the air 24 hours a day.",
            "As the temps rose each day, so did levels of ozone, oxygenated volatile organic chemicals (some of which are toxic to human airways) and acid-rich nanoparticles. Ozone levels, in particular, climbed as the heat rose. Then they stayed high throughout the hottest part of the day. That in itself was no surprise. Trees ramp up isoprene release during heat waves. Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",
            "The surprise was just how high the ozone levels climbed. If you just looked at the levels of other pollutants, like the nitrogen oxides from cars, you might think the air was safe to breathe.",
            "And while a heat wave feels miserable, says Zhang, \u201cexposure to both extreme heat and high ozone can be very dangerous.\u201d",
            "This research shows how \u201cclimate change is making air pollution harder to control,\u201d says Russ Dickerson. An atmospheric chemist, he works at the University of Maryland in College Park. Air pollution is a leading cause of death, he notes. The World Health Organization reports that today 99 percent of people worldwide are exposed to air unhealthy enough to pose a risk to our lungs.",
            "Clearly, trees play a role here. But chopping them down would be the wrong conclusion, he adds. \u201cTrees are generally good. But when you mix them with car and truck exhaust, bad things happen.\u201d",
            "\u201cStudies like this can help us improve our air-quality forecasting models,\u201d says Aara\u2019L Yarber. An atmospheric scientist, she works at Howard University in Washington, D.C. With such computer models, she says, \u201cWe can better predict bad-air days during heat waves.\u201d And that should help protect people\u2019s health.",
            "Data from this study are not limited to modeling sites like College Station, Aridjis-Olivos says. Being \u201csurrounded by vegetation, but also some industry and traffic,\u201d this region is similar to what\u2019s found many places, including in many developing nations.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "If you can\u2019t avoid a heat wave, how can you protect yourself from air pollution that may come with it? Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible. Remember to check your local air quality index when making plans, Yarber says. \u201cKids are especially sensitive to air pollution,\u201d she notes, \u201cbecause their lungs are still growing.\u201d",
            "At home, Dickerson recommends getting a low-cost HEPA filter from a hardware store. For breathing \u201ccleaner air \u2014 averaged over a day \u2014 put a HEPA filter in your bedroom,\u201d he says. As an alternative, you can even duct-tape five furnace filters together. Then direct air through it with an electric fan. Remember to keep the windows closed.",
            "There are also ways to improve outdoor air quality. For instance, communities can work to limit becoming \u201cheat islands.\u201d Two obvious ways: Increase shaded area, and limit how much heat-absorbing concrete they have.",
            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change? Planting trees.",

            "Hidden beneath all their rum-pum-pumming, woodpeckers are quietly grunt-grunt-grunting.",
            "The birds exhale each time they strike their beaks against tree bark. The sound is similar to a tennis player\u2019s grunt while hitting a ball. Woodpeckers match those exhales to their muscle movements. And that keeps them pecking at a surprisingly steady rate.",
            "The finding comes from a November 6 study in Journal of Experimental Biology.",
            "Woodpeckers are famous for hammering away at trees really fast and really hard. They strike wood hundreds of times per minute at forces 20 to 30 times their body weight. Until now, most research has focused on how woodpeckers do this without hurting their heads. The new research simply asked: How do woodpeckers do this at all?",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Pecking might look like a simple back-and-forth motion. But \u201cit\u2019s actually a very difficult, skillful behavior,\u201d says Nicholas Antonson. It involves \u201cthe movement of muscles across the body,\u201d he says. Antonson studies animal behavior at Brown University in Providence, R.I.",
            "He was part of a team that used a special kind of net to gently capture eight wild downy woodpeckers (Dryobates pubescens). They collected these birds from the Brown campus and surrounding area.",
            "To learn about the birds\u2019 movements, the scientists inserted electrodes into their muscles. Those devices picked up small electrical signals as the birds\u2019 muscles contracted, or shortened. Each bird wore a tiny backpack that recorded the electrode data. At the same time, a camera captured high-speed video of the birds\u2019 movements.",
            "The researchers watched the woodpeckers for a half hour at a time. They saw the birds drill, a behavior used to poke and dig. They also observed the birds tapping to communicate. After a few days, the scientists released the birds back into the wild.",
            "Woodpeckers drum too loud to hear anything but beaks on wood. But in this clip, the researchers turned data from the birds\u2019 respiratory system into sound. This allows us to \u201chear\u201d their breathing while pecking.",
            "A close look at the electrode and video data showed that woodpeckers\u2019 muscles and breathing work in harmony. This allows the birds\u2019 heads to move like hammers.",
            "When humans use a hammer, muscles in the back of their wrist stiffen. That cuts how much energy is lost when they hit something. The researchers saw a comparable stiffening in some of the woodpeckers\u2019 neck muscles. It\u2019s amazing, Antonson says, \u201cjust how similar it is to the way we hammer.\u201d",
            "Other muscles played special roles in the pecking motion. Before they struck, the birds seemed to steady themselves with their tail muscles. The power of the strike itself came from a single muscle in the hip.",
            "Distinct head and neck muscles helped pull back the head after each beat. These muscles activated before others completed their forward movement. The overlapping contractions may help smooth out the peckers\u2019 back-and-forth motions during a rapid drum solo.",
            "The team also looked at the woodpeckers\u2019 breathing to see if they exerted effort more like weightlifters or tennis players. Heavy weightlifters hold their breath when flexing. Tennis players, meanwhile, exhale through big movements.",
            "Downy woodpeckers, it turned out, take after tennis players. They can jab and exhale as many as 13 times per second. Between each blow, the birds take an inhale that lasts just 40 milliseconds. That\u2019s 10 times faster than some humans blink! The movement\u2019s timing stayed remarkably consistent over multiple taps, Antonson reports.",
            "Songbirds are known to take mini breaths while singing. Woodpeckers doing the same thing suggests their pecking, when done socially, might be more like singing than experts had thought, says Daniel Tobiansky. He wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. He studies bird brains and behavior at Providence College in Rhode Island.",
            "Nonvocal communication, such as pecking, often gets overlooked in animal research, Tobiansky says. Finding a similarity between bird drumming and singing might help scientists learn how these behaviors evolved."

            "In the body, many compounds bind to sites called receptors. Some food chemicals dock onto the tongue\u2019s sweet, salty, sour, bitter or umami taste receptors. Other compounds \u2014 called retronasal odors \u2014 travel through the roof of the mouth. They stick to odor receptors in the back of the nose. They can change how we experience flavor.",

            "The brain combines tastes and smells to create our sense of flavor. But science has struggled to find precisely where in the brain this happens.",
            "In the new work, Khorisantono\u2019s team trained 25 people to connect mixtures of smells and tastes with certain flavors. Then they gave these people droplets of beverages. The tiny drinks were designed to activate either taste or retronasal receptors. As this happened, the researchers scanned brain activity in their trainees.",
            "To figure out which brains regions were at work during these tests, the team used machine learning. A type of artificial intelligence, it teaches a computer to do a task. Here, they gave it lots of data from people who labeled key types of information. In this case, a computer program received scanned pictures of the brain. The researchers labeled the scans with the beverage the trainees had sipped when the picture was taken. Computer programs that train in this way are called machine-learning algorithms. \u00a0",
            "The team narrowed down possible brain regions by isolating different parts of the brain from their scans. Then they used each of these to train machine-learning algorithms.",
            "Khorisantono tested the algorithms\u2019 ability to guess what people had smelled based on the brain images alone. One of the best algorithms had been trained on images from a brain region called the insula.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Scientists once thought the insula responded only to tastes, Khorisantono says. But by 2017, work with rodents showed the insula could also process smells. Last year, scientists found that some insula cells respond to combinations of smells and tastes. That hinted that it may play a role in identifying flavor.",
            "The new study backs that up: that the insula is key to both smell and flavor.",
            "When participants in the new study got either the retronasal aroma of a specific flavor, or its taste, scans of the insula looked about the same. So the insula likely interpreted these smell and taste signals similarly.",

He works at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T\u00fcbingen, Germany.",

Participants remembered more \u2014 about 50 percent \u2014 if they\u2019d received a large reward for labeling the animals earlier.",
            "This memory boost didn\u2019t work for tools, though. Big rewards didn\u2019t help people remember the tools they\u2019d seen earlier. Lin suspects that\u2019s because people formed strong memories of the tools from the beginning, so adding a reward didn\u2019t provide much more of a benefit.",
            "Rewards for animals also didn\u2019t help people remember which tools they\u2019d seen. It seems the brain links memories within a category, not across different categories.",

            "Everyday memories are known to be temporary, says Joseph Dunsmoor. This cognitive neuroscientist works at the University of Texas at Austin where he has done similar research. This new study, he notes, is one of the first to show the brain is more likely to recall weak memories when they relate to some other, strong memory. \u201cThe thing that occurred in the past suddenly takes on more meaning,\u201d he concludes.",
            "Lin\u2019s team also showed that people were better at forming new memories after receiving a big reward. After a big event, the brain is alert. It\u2019s open to new information. So now, Lin says, new memories are more likely to stick around.",
            "Sorting out what\u2019s going on in the brain while memories form will take more time.",
            "In the meantime, therapists could use these findings to help people enhance the everyday memories that occurred before a trauma. This might dull the pain of what came after, Lin says. Teachers might also use the findings to help students retain more of what they learn. For instance, Lin suggests, if Susie surprisingly jumps up and down in a math word problem, perhaps the class should jump up and down, too."

            "New unfurling parachutes really hit the mark. Scientists were inspired by the Japanese art of kirigami, or paper cutting. They made parachutes that open automatically when dropped. And unlike typical cloth parachutes, where they land doesn\u2019t depend on how they were dropped. This makes their falls more predictable.",

            "It\u2019s made of a plastic called Mylar. Slits are arranged in a series of rings that extend to the disk\u2019s edge. They allow the disk to expand into an elegant netlike vase as its attached cargo falls. Pulled open by the rush of air, the chute\u2019s shape slows the payload\u2019s fall by producing drag. That\u2019s a force that resists an object\u2019s motion. ",

            "Researcher Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Gosselin demonstrates how his team\u2019s kirigami-inspired parachutes are made and how they work.",
            "The team compared its new parachute against traditional parachutes in the lab. The kirigami parachutes fell closer to an intended target, the researchers found. They shared their results in the Oct. 2 Nature. The parachutes would also be simple to make and deploy, M\u00e9lan\u00e7on says. Traditional fabric parachutes require sewing and folding.",
            "As a simple test, the researchers attached a 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) water bottle to a kirigami parachute 0.5 meter (1.6 feet) across. They dropped it from a drone flying at a height of 60 meters (200 feet). The bottle reached a speed of about 14 meters per second (46 feet per second). A bottle without a parachute would\u2019ve topped out at about 34 meters per second (112 feet per second).",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Because they\u2019re full of holes, the new parachutes produce less drag than similarly sized fabric parachutes. That means they have to be bigger than a normal parachute. So they might not be practical for large things. Consider a person. To keep from crash-landing, a human might need a kirigami parachute a couple hundred meters (yards) across, M\u00e9lan\u00e7on suggests. That would be longer than two football fields!",
            "These new parachutes could help with smaller drops, though. For instance, they could be used to deliver packages by drones. Or they could be used for dropping food or other supplies from airplanes in hard-to-reach areas, he says.",
            "The team is also considering using materials like cardboard that can break down easily in the environment. And there may be other ways to tweak the parachutes\u2019 design. For example, the disks could be cut so that they fall with the whirling motion of winged maple seeds. That could come in handy on space missions to other planets. It would let an on-board camera take photos from all angles as it descends through an alien atmosphere."

That\u2019s about one-one hundredth of an inch long. A bioengineer, Lahiji works at Cursus Bio. It\u2019s a drug company in Seoul, South Korea.

            "Hyaluronic (HY-uh-lu-RON-ik) acid \u2014 a chemical that plumps up our skin \u2014 gives structural support to the microneedles. Those tiny needles then deliver antibacterial compounds right where they\u2019re needed. Inflammation-fighting chemicals also cool redness and swelling.",
            "Among tests in treated people, more than eight in 10 of patched pimples disappeared within three days. Details of how the new tech works appear in the July Biological and Medical Applications of Materials and Interfaces.",
            "Lahiji\u2019s team didn\u2019t invent pimple patches. People can buy simpler styles today. Many of those, too, use microneedles. But needles in the new patches have a unique geometry that anchors them in place.\u00a0It sets them apart from what you can buy now, Lahiji says.",
            "The microneedles used in other drug-delivery patches tend to be cone-shaped. But that means they easily slip out of the skin. The Korean team gave their needles a bulb-shaped bottom. They call the design \u201cMicroLock.\u201d Like soft-edged-cylindrical barbs, they lock in place.",

            "Such patches show a lot of potential, \u00c7elik says. For instance, they might one day provide shot-free options for the delivery of some injectable drugs. Or even vaccines.",
            "Such patches could offer other advantages, too, he adds. A shot puts a lot of the medicine into a tiny area. In contrast, \u00c7elik notes, patches would deliver a drug to a broader area \u2014 \u201cnot a single point.\u201d He believes that will lead to a better immune response than a typical shot.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The needles of the new acne patch are too short to deliver a vaccine. But Lahiji and his team have developed other versions that might enable other uses for the \u201clocking\u201d microneedles.",
            "For now, notes Lahiji, \u201cthere are no microneedle products [for] medicines that require prescriptions.\u201d Or for vaccines. But his team is working on ways that microneedles could deliver such drugs. One type would deliver medicines targeted at diabetes and obesity. His group described it in 2024 in Advanced Materials.",
            "Governments regulate what new medical products can be used in their countries. These rules ensure those products are safe. In the United States, for instance, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, writes those rules. Right now, no such rules exist for microneedle patches, \u00c7elik notes. That makes them a headache for companies to develop and bring to pharmacies. \u201cEveryone is waiting for\u201d those guidelines, he says.",
            "Acne patches are an exception to that. These patches are deemed \u201ccosmetic,\u201d not medical. Their needles not only are extra tiny, but they also deliver no prescription drugs \u2014 just over-the-counter acne-clearing meds.",
            "Locking microneedles might help open the door for patch delivery of other medications. Why? When it comes to prescription drugs, how much a patch dispenses really matters, explains \u00c7elik. The FDA would require a patch to deliver a set dose \u2014 not more, not less. Patches typically lack such consistency.",
            "For example, a patch may deliver 40 percent of the drug one time. The next, it might deliver only 8 percent, notes \u00c7elik. A microneedle patch for prescription medicines, he says, must deliver the same amount of drug \u201ceach and every time.\u201d",
            "By anchoring the new patches in place, the new microneedles should mean that \u201cevery time, they will deliver approximately 80 percent of the drug,\u201d \u00c7elik says. At least, he adds, \u201cThat\u2019s what [its makers now] claim.\u201d",
            "Other problems remain to be solved, such as how big a dose they can dispense. For some drugs, the tiny needles may not be able to deliver enough to have the needed effect, says \u00c7elik. In these cases, they may never fully replace hypodermic needles.",
            "The new acne patch system was developed by Cursus Bio. Its product should hit store shelves in Korea by November, Lahiji says. U.S. consumers will have to wait a few months longer \u2014 until at least next January.",
