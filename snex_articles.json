When a user places one between their lips or cheeks and their gum, nicotine seeps into their bloodstream through the lining of their mouth.",

            "Multiple fast-moving and destructive wildfires are burning Los Angeles County in California. These fires have been fueled by unusually dry conditions and hurricane-force seasonal winds. Gusts reached over 145 kilometers (90 miles) per hour. They quickly drove the blazes into urban areas. This has forced more than 100,000 people to evacuate from their homes and killed at least five people as of January 9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The largest of the blazes is known as the Palisades Fire. It erupted the morning of January 7 on the west side of Los Angeles. It has since burned around 7,000 hectares (17,000 acres) of land. And it has destroyed around 1,000 structures. The second largest is called the Eaton Fire. It ignited near Pasadena that night and had burned more than 4,290 hectares by the next morning. Three more smaller fires \u2014 the Sunset, Hurst and Lidia fires \u2014 are also burning in other locations around the area.",
            "\u201cThis has the potential to be, at least collectively, the costliest wildfire disaster in American history,\u201d Daniel Swain said during a January 8 livestream. Swain is a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cEven just the Palisades fire on its own may become so.\u201d",
            "Here is a quick look at what is driving these extreme blazes.",
            "Fire season in Southern California is generally thought to stretch from May to October. But recent research has shown that rising temperatures and decreased precipitation trends are expanding the fire season\u2019s duration. That widening of the season is projected to continue in the future. In some parts of the state, fire season is already considered to be an all-year affair.",
            "One of the big reasons the Los Angeles area fires are growing so out of control is the Santa Ana winds. These winds typically occur in the fall and winter. Dry wind blows from inland, high desert areas toward the California coast. Along the way, the wind goes over mountain ranges. As the wind travels down the mountains, it becomes compressed. This is due to increased atmospheric pressure. The air also warms. That in turn lowers the relative humidity of the already dry desert air. And it makes that air better at drying out vegetation that can fuel fires.",
            "What\u2019s more, the Santa Ana winds can reach up to 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles per hour). That makes them very good at fanning flames and spreading embers. In the days preceding the fires, the National Weather Service in Los Angeles warned that a \u201clife-threatening, destructive windstorm\u201d would drive extreme fire risk.",
            "The other big driver of the extreme fires is the abundance of dried-out grass and vegetation. The area\u2019s vegetation is so dry because of recent weather patterns. \u201cIn a very dry year, there is a lot less grass that grows in Southern California versus a wet one,\u201d Swain said. \u201cLast year was very wet in Southern California. [That led] to what we call excessive fuel loading, a lot of extra fuel for potential fires,\u201d he noted. \u201cNow, since September, Southern California has seen the driest start to the winter on record, period, as well as among the hottest starts to winter on record.\u201d",
            "This combination of the Santa Ana winds and high fuel loads set the stage for the devasting burning occurring now.\u00a0",
            "It will take a little bit more time for researchers to determine exactly how much the burning of fossil fuels has influenced these specific wildfires. However, it\u2019s undeniable that human-caused climate change has worsened the weather conditions favorable for more intense wildfires in California.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that drier conditions are perpetually more likely in the warming climate,\u201d Swain said. Wetter years will probably continue to get even wetter. \u201cAt the same time, we\u2019re also getting much hotter summers and drier falls,\u201d he said. There\u2019s also \u201can increasing likelihood of dry winters.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/_9LL2X3Uayc?feature=oembed",
            "Individual wildfires are difficult to tie to climate change, due to the large number of factors that affect their spread. However, it is clear that human-caused climate change has worsened the weather conditions favorable to intense wildfires in California.",
            "In California, this worsening weather whiplash makes conditions for wildfires more favorable. Wetter years grow more vegetation. And the drier years that follow then prime those fuels for burning.",
            "Much of the area now burning in Southern California is dominated by grass and brush. These landscapes are especially sensitive to this weather whiplash. That\u2019s because vast tracts of fire-fueling grasses can grow or disappear within a single year depending on the weather.",
            "Smoke from the Los Angeles wildfires could impact the health of millions of people in the region. Fine particulates within the wildfire smoke can impact the health of even those who live far from fires. These aerosols can damage lungs, increase the risk of heart attacks and even lower life expectancy. Smoke can pose a particular risk to kids and teens. A recent study estimated that California wildfire smoke from 2008 to 2018 caused up to 55,700 premature deaths.",
            "Smoke from the Palisades fire \u201chas caused unhealthy air quality in Los Angeles County.\u201d That\u2019s according to the L.A. Department of Public Health. The worst immediate impacts are expected to affect the northwest coastal parts of the county.",
            "But it is difficult to predict where smoke will travel and how winds will impact air quality. \u201cSo it\u2019s important for everyone to stay aware of the air quality in your area, make plans and take action to protect your health and your family\u2019s health,\u201d Muntu Davis, a health officer for Los Angeles County said in its health advisory. \u201cSmoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy. However, people at higher risk include children, older adults, pregnant individuals and those with heart or lung conditions or weakened immune systems.\u201d"

No one knows just how that explosion formed the tendrils now surrounding the dead star. But new observations capture the 3-D structure and motion of this debris.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s a piece of the puzzle towards understanding this very bizarre [supernova] remnant,\u201d says Tim Cunningham. An astronomer, he works at the Harvard & Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. That\u2019s in Cambridge, Mass. He was part of a team that shared its new findings November 1 in\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
            "Astronomers in China and Japan first noted this supernova in 1181 as a \u201cguest star\u201d in the sky. But modern astronomers didn\u2019t find the remains of that explosion, now called the Pa 30 nebula, until 2013.",
            "When they did find the remnant, it looked weird. The supernova appeared to be a kind called type 1a. This type of stellar explosion involves a white dwarf star\u00a0blowing up and destroying itself in the process. But in the case of Pa 30, part of the star survived.",
            "Stranger still, the star was surrounded by spiky filaments. Those tendrils stretch about three light-years in all directions. \u201cThis is really unique,\u201d Cunningham says. \u201cThere\u2019s no other supernova nebula that shows filaments like this.\u201d",
            "He and his colleagues used a telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii to look at the nebula. They recorded how fast the filaments are moving relative to Earth. Then they built a 3-D model of those filaments and their motions through space.",
            "The system is structured \u201ckind of like a three-layered onion,\u201d Cunningham says. The inner layer is the star. Then there\u2019s a gap of one or two light-years, which ends in a spherical shell of dust. The final layer is the filaments, which emerge from the dust shell.",
            "How the filaments formed remains a mystery. Also unclear is how those spikes have managed to stay in such straight lines for centuries.",
            "Maybe a shock wave from the explosion ricocheted off the wispy material between this star and its neighbors. As the shock wave bounced back toward the white dwarf, it could have sculpted the material into the spikes astronomers see. But future studies will have to confirm or rule out that scenario."

            "To harvest static electricity created by wind, Meder places artificial leaves on plants. The fake leaves include a layer of rubber \u2014 a material good at building up static charge. When wind rustles one of these bionic plants, the artificial leaves bump into real leaves. This creates static charges that pass into the inner tissue of the real plant leaf, producing a current. This energy can be harvested through electrodes placed in the plant leaf. Meder\u2019s studies have shown that such devices can light up LED lights.\u00a0",
            "Meder\u2019s energy-harvesting tech relies on both plastics and plants to get the job done. \u201cYou may think that the plant is [the] fragile part, but it\u2019s actually not,\u201d says Meder. It\u2019s \u201cthe artificial part which usually fails.\u201d Mishaps such as cable breaks pose the biggest problem. And once a piece of gear is broken, it needs to be repaired. The plants, though, can adapt to different environments and heal themselves.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Working with living materials does pose some extra design challenges. For one thing, it requires keeping those living parts alive, says Meder. Like fungi, plants need certain resources to stay healthy. \u201cPhotosynthesis is a big part of that.\u201d To accommodate that need, engineers might use transparent materials to make parts that would otherwise block out sunlight. Or they might use lighter materials that don\u2019t weigh leaves down.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Certain plants would work better with Meder\u2019s system than others. Evergreen trees, which keep their leaves throughout the year, are more ideal than deciduous plants that lose their leaves during winter. But Meder is excited about this new way to tap a potential energy source. \u201cIt\u2019s always about harvesting [these] crumbs of energy which we otherwise would just lose.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",

            "But the internet is not magic. The simple explanation is that the internet \u201cis a network of computers where people can share information,\u201d says Anne Lee. She is an expert in telecommunications at Nokia Bell Labs in Naperville, Ill. Telecommunications includes any exchange of information \u2014 also called data \u2014 over a distance.",
            "The global internet is more than just computers, though. It\u2019s a massive structure, with components that crisscross the globe. Cables snake below your feet. Wireless signals fly over your head. Numerous devices hide within your community. Your devices tap into this structure whenever they exchange data.",
            "When the internet first became commonplace, people called it the \u201cinformation superhighway.\u201d Thinking about roads can really help you understand how it all works.",
            "When your family goes on a road trip, you probably start out on smaller side streets. Then you merge onto a highway where you can travel quickly with lots of other drivers. The internet\u2019s infrastructure is similar. Its vast network of roadlike cables direct data from far-flung places toward large central channels. Traveling data are even called \u201cinternet traffic.\u201d",
            "Fiber-optic cables are the roads of the internet. They contain glass filaments that carry data as bursts of light. Over 500 of these cables stretch beneath the oceans. Even more are buried underground or strung up on poles. If you could stretch out all the fiber-optic cable on Earth end-to-end, it would reach around 4 billion kilometers (2.5 billion miles). All that cable would stretch from the sun past the orbit of Uranus!",
            "Just as roads have different numbers of lanes, these cables also come in different sizes. Bigger cables with more filaments can carry more data at once. Bandwidth is the rate of data passing through every second. The thickest cables, about the size of a garden hose, are like an interstate highway. They have the highest bandwidth. \u00a0",
            "Internet service providers (ISPs) are companies or governments that manage networks of connected cables and routers. These owners also fix these networks when they break. Verizon and AT&T are two examples of U.S.-based ISPs. Some countries provide internet service for their citizens.",

Wi-Fi routers and cellular antennas have cables that connect them to the rest of the network.",

Each packet gets bundled with a lot of extra information, such as what the picture is and how to put its packets back together. There\u2019s also info on how to fix any errors that might happen during the journey. And there may be a layer of encryption to keep the packet safe, so no one but the receiver can read its data.",

            "In the new work, researchers conducted laboratory tests on the pain of hair-pulling. A hair pull was about 10 times as painful as a pinprick, reported Emma Kindstr\u00f6m of Link\u00f6ping University in Sweden. Her group also found that the pain was detected by a large, propeller-shaped protein known as PIEZO2.",
            "That was a surprise.",
            "Scientists knew PIEZO2 detects pressure, including light touches. It wasn\u2019t thought to detect sudden, sharp pain. But people who lack this protein don\u2019t feel hair-pull pain.",
            "A hair-pull sends a pain signal along nerve fibers much faster than other sorts of pain, Kindstr\u00f6m says. In fact, she reports, it travels through a different type of nerve fiber, called A-beta. Other kinds of pain signals, such as a burn from a hot stove, travel far more slowly and along different kinds of fibers.",
            "People probably vary in how much hair pulling hurts, she says. \u201cSome people enjoy taking a very, very hot shower, while some people find it very painful. I don\u2019t see why hair pulling would be different.\u201d",
            "She sees this sort of difference in her pet dogs. One of them, Harry, doesn\u2019t mind getting brushed. But Norton, the other? He\u2019s very sensitive to fur pulling. And he reacts \u2014 with a bite."

Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",

It\u2019s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth\u2019s surface. Extremely dense, it\u2019s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It\u2019s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400\u00b0 Celsius (9,800\u00b0 Fahrenheit). That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",
            "This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot\u00a0and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.",
            "Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle\u2019s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth\u2019s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.",
            "Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare \u201csuper-deep\u201d diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.",

The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It\u2019s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

In 2018, 58 percent of those polled agreed with the statement, \u201cPlaces can be haunted by spirits.\u201d And almost one in five people from\u00a0the United States said in another survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center in Washington, D.C., that they\u2019ve seen or been in the presence of a ghost.",

However, none of these offer good evidence of ghosts. Some are hoaxes, created to fool people. The rest only prove that equipment sometimes can capture noise, images or other signals that people don\u2019t expect. Ghosts are the least likely of many possible explanations.",
            "Not only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. What scientists have discovered, though, are lots of reasons why people might feel they have had ghostly encounters.",
            "What their data show is that you can\u2019t always trust your eyes, ears or brain.",
            "Dom began having unusual experiences when he was eight or nine. He would wake up unable to move. He researched what was happening to him. And he learned that science had a name for it: sleep paralysis. This condition leaves someone feeling awake but paralyzed, or frozen in place. He can\u2019t move or speak or breathe deeply. He may also see, hear or feel figures or creatures that aren\u2019t really there. This is called a hallucination (Huh-LU-sih-NA-shun).",

            "Sleep paralysis \u201cis like dreaming with your eyes open,\u201d explains Baland Jalal. A neuroscientist, he studies sleep paralysis at the University of Cambridge in England. He says this is why it happens: Our most vivid, lifelike dreams happen during a certain stage of sleep. It\u2019s called rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. In this stage, your eyes dart around under their closed lids. Though your eyes move, the rest of your body can\u2019t. It\u2019s paralyzed. Most likely, that\u2019s to prevent people from acting out their dreams. (That could get dangerous! Imagine flailing your arms and legs as you play dream basketball, only to whack your knuckles on the wall and tumble to the floor.)",
            "Your brain usually turns this paralysis off before you wake up. But in sleep paralysis, you wake up while it\u2019s still happening.",

Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?",
            "These misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He\u2019s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.",
            "We\u2019re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing a hallucination, our first instinct is usually to believe it. If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died \u2014 and trust your perceptions \u2014 then \u201cit has to be a ghost,\u201d says Smailes. That\u2019s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.",
            "The brain has a tough job. Information from the world bombards you as a mixed-up jumble of signals. The eyes take in color. The ears take in sounds. The skin senses pressure. The brain works to make sense of this mess. This is called bottom-up processing. And the brain is very good at it. It\u2019s so good that it sometimes finds meaning in meaningless things. This is known as pareidolia (Pear-eye-DOH-lee-ah). You experience it whenever you stare at clouds and see rabbits, ships or faces. Or gaze at the moon and see a face.",

            "The brain also does top-down processing. It adds information to your perception of the world. Most of the time, there is way too much stuff coming in through the senses. Paying attention to all of it would overwhelm you. So your brain picks out the most important parts. And then it fills in the rest. \u201cThe vast majority of perception is the brain filling in the gaps,\u201d explains Smailes.",
            "What you see right now isn\u2019t what\u2019s actually out there in the world. It\u2019s a picture your brain painted for you based on signals captured by your eyes. The same goes for your other senses. Most of the time, this picture is accurate. But sometimes, the brain adds things that aren\u2019t there.",
            "For example, when you mishear the lyrics in a song, your brain filled in a meaning that wasn\u2019t there. (And it will most likely continue to mishear those words even after you learn the right ones.)",
            "This is very similar to what happens when so-called ghost hunters capture sounds that they say are ghosts speaking. (They call this electronic voice phenomenon, or EVP.) The recording is probably just random noise. If you listen to it without knowing what was supposedly said, you probably won\u2019t hear words. But when you know what the words are supposed to be, you might now find that you can discern them easily.",
            "Your brain may also add faces to images of random noise. Research has shown that patients who experience visual hallucinations are more likely than normal to experience pareidolia \u2014 see faces in random shapes, for instance.",
            "In one 2018 study, Smailes\u2019 team tested whether this might also be true for healthy people. They recruited 82 volunteers. First, the researchers asked a series of questions about how often these volunteers had hallucination-like experiences.

Twelve of these images were faces that were easy to see. Another 24 were hard-to-see faces. And 24 more images showed no faces at all \u2014 just more noise. The volunteers had to report whether a face was present or absent in each flash. In a separate test, the researchers showed the same volunteers a series of 36 images. Two-thirds of them contained a face pareidolia. The remaining 12 did not.",
            "Participants who had initially reported more hallucination-like experiences were also more likely to report faces in the flashes of random noise. They were also better at identifying those images that contained face pareidolia.",
            "In the next few years, Smailes plans to study situations in which people might be more likely to see faces in randomness.",
            "When people sense ghosts, he points out, \u201cThey\u2019re often alone, in the dark and scared.\u201d If it\u2019s dark, your brain can\u2019t get much visual information from the world. It has to create more of your reality for you. In this type of situation, Smailes says, the brain may be more likely to impose its own creations onto reality.",
            "The brain\u2019s picture of reality sometimes includes things that aren\u2019t there. But it can also completely miss things that are there. This is called inattentional blindness. Want to know how it works? Watch the video before you keep reading.",
            "The video shows people in white and black shirts passing a basketball. Count how many times the people in white shirts pass the ball. How many did you see?",

            "\u201cMemory does not work like a video camera,\u201d says Christopher French. He is a psychologist in England at Goldsmiths University of London. You only remember things you\u2019re paying attention to. Some people are more likely to become absorbed than others. And these people also report higher levels of paranormal beliefs, he says, including beliefs in ghosts.",
            "How could these things be related? Some strange experiences that people blame on ghosts involve unexplained sounds or movements. A window may seem to open all by itself. But what if someone opened it and you just didn\u2019t notice because you were so absorbed in something else? That\u2019s a lot more likely than a ghost, French says.",
            "In one 2014 study, French and his colleagues found that people with higher levels of paranormal beliefs and higher tendencies to get absorbed are also more likely to experience inattentional blindness. They also tend to have a more limited working memory. That\u2019s how much information you can hold in your memory at once.",
            "If you have trouble keeping lots of information in your memory or paying attention to more than one thing at once, then you risk missing sensory cues from the environment around you. And you might blame any misperceptions that result on a ghost.",
            "Anyone may experience sleep paralysis, hallucinations, pareidolia or inattentional blindness. But not everyone turns to ghosts or other supernatural beings as a way to explain these experiences. Even as a child, Dom never thought he had come face to face with a real ghost. He went online and asked questions about what might have happened. He used critical thinking. And he got the answers he needed. When an episode happens now, he uses a technique that Jalal developed. Dom doesn\u2019t try to stop the episode. He just focuses on his breathing, tries to relax as much as possible and waits for it to pass. He says, \u201cI deal with it far better. I just sleep and enjoy sleeping.\u201d",
            "Robyn Andrews is a psychology student at the University of South Wales in Treforest. She wondered if people with stronger critical-thinking skills might be less likely to believe in the paranormal. So she and her mentor, psychologist Philip Tyson, recruited 687 students for a study about their paranormal beliefs. The students majored in a wide range of different fields. Each was asked how strongly he or she agreed with statements such as, \u201cIt is possible to communicate with the dead.\u201d Or \u201cYour mind or soul can leave your body and travel.\u201d The research team also looked at the students\u2019 grades on a recent assignment.",

            "Students with higher grades tended to have lower levels of paranormal beliefs, this study found. And students in the physical sciences, engineering or math tended not to believe as strongly as those studying the arts. This trend also has been seen in research by others.",
            "This study did not actually assess the students\u2019 ability to think critically. \u201cThat\u2019s something we would look into as a future study,\u201d says Andrews. However, previous research has shown that science students tend to have stronger critical-thinking skills than art students. That\u2019s probably because you need to think critically in order to conduct scientific experiments. And thinking critically can help you scout out likely causes for an unusual experience without involving ghosts (or aliens, or Bigfoot).",
            "Even among science students and working scientists, though, paranormal beliefs persist. Andrews and Tyson think that\u2019s a problem. If you can\u2019t judge whether a ghost story or spooky experience is real or not, you may also get fooled by advertisements, bogus medical cures or fake news, says Tyson. It\u2019s important for everyone to learn how to question information and seek reasonable, realistic explanations.",
            "So if someone tells you a ghost story this Halloween, enjoy it. But remain skeptical. Think about other possible explanations for what was described. Remember that your mind may fool you into experiencing spooky things.",

            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself.

            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",

            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",

            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",

He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",

            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",

But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",

He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",

            "In winter, a sudden drop in temperature can trigger a frost quake. During one of these events, the ground splits with a loud boom and shakes like an earthquake but on a much smaller scale. People who have felt a frost quake say it feels like a car ran into their building.",
            "Frost quakes happen when water from rainfall, snowmelt or flooding soaks into the ground, filling all available spaces. The soil becomes saturated, like a sponge filled with water. And when a cold front bringing Arctic air plunges temperatures outside well below freezing \u2014 say, about \u201315\u00b0 Celsius (5\u00b0 Fahrenheit) \u2014 water in the soil begins to freeze.",
            "As water freezes, its molecules line up in a specific crystal structure. This causes solid ice to take up more space than liquid water. As freezing water expands underground, it presses against nearby soil, and pressure builds. The pressure eventually becomes so great that it causes the frozen soil to crack, allowing one section to slide past another. This sliding is similar to what happens during an earthquake. But earthquakes begin deep underground, and frost quakes occur close to the surface.",
            "People are more likely to hear the boom of shattering ground from a frost quake than they are to feel the jolt it creates. That\u2019s because shaking is limited to a small area \u2014 sometimes just a few hundred meters (or feet). Some can be felt a few kilometers (a mile or two) away.",
            "Frost quakes are less likely to happen when snow blankets the ground. That\u2019s because snow insulates the soil, protecting it from dropping air temperatures. Although Arctic air may make us shiver, those super-cold temperatures aren\u2019t able to freeze water in the soil.",
            "Frost quakes are just one type of cryoseism (CRY-oh-SY-zum). That is, a seismic event caused by the cracking of frozen ground. The other type is an ice quake, which takes place in glaciers or lake ice. Frost quakes only occur in frozen soil or rock.",

            "A mountainside in Greenland collapsed catastrophically into the ocean, last year. The landslide triggered a wave as tall as the Statue of Liberty. This wave \u2014 a tsunami \u2014 swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down a fjord there. Its rapid and violent motion ripped up the coastline. And its vibrations were so violent that they were detected worldwide.",
            "Indeed, they rang the planet like a seismic bell every minute and a half \u2014 for nine straight days.",
            "The good news: No one was hurt. Large tourist ships ventured into that same fjord on the days before and after the tsunami. They were ferrying people on and off a beach with small boats, according to Kristian Svennevig.",
            "\u201cIt was pure luck that no one was there when it happened,\u201d he says. The powerful wave would have easily capsized the small boats and swept the people away.",
            "Svennevig is a geologist with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS). He\u2019s based in Copenhagen, Denmark. He led a team that investigated the event. They now believe that Earth\u2019s warming climate set off the massive landslide that started it all. They described their findings September 13 in Science.",
            "Aside from those caused by earthquakes and volcanoes, \u201cmost landslides around the world you can tie to climatic factors,\u201d says Svennevig. And as Earth keeps warming, he worries, this dangerous event could be a warning of worse things to come.",
            "Saturday, September 16, 2023, started normally enough. But then at 11:35 a.m., sensors in Asia and North America picked up a sharp seismic signal. They detected waves rippling from a remote part of Greenland\u2019s east coast.",
            "Earthquakes typically cause such vibrations. But explosions, tsunamis and volcanoes can, too. Initially, the source here was unknown.",
            "The next day, tourists on a cruise ship noticed damage to an abandoned research station on east Greenland\u2019s Ella Island. Equipment that was stored on land, including a boat and a truck-size shipping container, had been washed into the sea.",
            "Svennevig heard these reports when he arrived at work Monday morning. Suspecting a tsunami, he looked through recent satellite images of the area. He hoped they would offer clues.",
            "And they did.",
            "For many kilometers along Dickson Fjord, vegetation had been erased from the shorelines. At Ella Island, the plants had vanished to heights as much as four meters (13 feet) above the water. Further west and inland, plants were missing to higher and higher coastal elevations.",
            "A huge wave must have come from the west, Svennevig realized. It would have started out tall and gradually shrunk as it rolled east.",

            "The collapsed ridge had smashed down onto the glacier below. It released some 25 million cubic meters (880 million cubic feet) of rock and shattered ice. The volume of this debris was equal to 10,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. This rock and ice tumbled off the end of the glacier and into the fjord\u2019s water.",

            "fCA mountain ridge overlooking this glacier in Greenland collapsed into a massive landslide. The tsunami it triggered swept 80 kilometers (50 miles) down the fjord. Climate warming set off the disaster by causing the glacier to thin, which destabilized the mountain ridge that it had supported.",
            "The resulting splash threw water 200 meters (650 feet) up the nearby mountain slopes. The wave it triggered was 110 meters (360 feet) tall. It may have sped along the fjord at 160 kilometers (100 miles) per hour or more!",
            "But there wasn\u2019t just a single wave.",
            "This explosive event provoked a repeating wave called a seiche (SAYSH). It resembled the back-and-forth sloshing of water in a bathtub. Except here it was way bigger \u2014 echoing through the fjord every 90 seconds for nine straight days.",
            "Though sudden, this catastrophe was caused by changes that have been slowly happening for decades. Earth\u2019s warming climate has shrunk the glacier by Dickson Fjord over time. No one knows how quickly it was losing ice. But other glaciers in this part of Greenland have thinned by as much as 150 meters (490 feet) since 1900. As the glaciers thinned, they laid bare the fragile mountain slopes that their ice had previously supported.",
            "And this appears to be why the ridge at Dickson Fjord collapsed, Svennevig says. It lost that icy support.",
            "He fears such disasters could become more common as Greenland and other Arctic sites warm.",
            "Since 2017, Svennevig has used satellite images to map more than 500 landslides along Greenland\u2019s coasts. Some happened thousands of years ago. Others crumbled as recently as 2021.",
            "In warmer parts of the world, heavy rains often trigger landslides. But a warming of permafrost caused many of the recent ones in Greenland. And here\u2019s how.",
            "As long as the temperature inside a mountain is no warmer than -10\u00b0 Celsius (14\u00b0 Fahrenheit), the ice within it acts as cement. It glues bits of rock together. But if the permafrost warms to around -1 \u00b0C (30 \u00b0F), that ice will change. \u201cIt actually starts to deform, like plastic or Play-Doh,\u201d Svennevig explains. Now individual rock bits no longer stick together. This can allow part of the mountainside to collapse.",
            "Indeed, at the sites of new landslides, he often sees rectangular blocks of frozen rock and gravel within the wreckage. Those house-sized icy blocks slowly thaw and crumble.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Elsewhere, melting ice has caused similar disasters.",
            "In 2016, two mountain glaciers in Tibet suddenly collapsed. Gradual warming weakened the Aru-1 and Aru-2 glaciers until their ice could no longer hold onto the mountain. The debris from this disintegration sent enough snow and ice cascading into a valley to fill 60,000 Olympic swimming pools.",
            "The ice and snow traveled up to eight kilometers (five miles) from its source. Along the way, it killed nine herders and hundreds of livestock.",
            "Melting Himalayan glaciers create a different hazard, too. Vast lakes of meltwater have formed behind huge rock piles at the ends of the glaciers. These lakes can suddenly burst out of their fragile natural dams. The resulting \u201coutburst floods\u201d can gush tens of kilometers down through any valley below, sweeping away people, homes, bridges and animals.\u00a0",
            "But landslide-tsunamis are especially worrisome because they often happen at sites with more people.",
            "In 1936, one roared through Lake Lovatnet in Norway. It swept away two villages, killing 74 people. And in 1958, a wave in Lituya Bay, Alaska, struck three large fishing vessels. One capsized and sank. One was tossed onto a hillside and destroyed. The third was tossed over a narrow strip of land and into deeper water; that boat, its captain and his 10-year-old son somehow survived.",
            "More recently, a 2017 landslide-tsunami flooded a village in western Greenland, killing four.",
            "But the risk of such an event around cruise ships that venture into fjords could prove especially catastrophic.",
            "\u201cThat is something that we definitely think a lot about,\u201d says Katherine Barnhart. She\u2019s a geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. She studies landslide and tsunami risks in Alaska\u2019s Prince William Sound. Much like Dickson Fjord in Greenland, steep mountains line its narrow, branching bay. And here, too, glaciers are shrinking.",
            "Detailed studies like the one Svennevig just published will help Barnhart accomplish a difficult task: building a computer program that can predict the size of a tsunami that a potential landslide might cause. \u201cBuilding up an inventory of events that have happened is really valuable,\u201d she explains.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/60T9TKuuujs?feature=oembed",
            "Authors of the new study explain how it took dozens of scientists to diagnose the source of an \u201cunusual seismic object, or USO\u201d that traveled around the globe for more than a week. Such events, they explain, can have deadly outcomes.",
            "The latest discovery leads Svennevig to worry that things could become worse. Far worse.",
            "Two years ago, one of his collaborators noticed something strange. At the time, Matthew Owen was a marine geologist at Aarhus University in Denmark. He was building sonar maps of the seafloor in Vaigat strait. It\u2019s a narrow ocean channel off western Greenland. These 3-D seafloor maps were being made to help scientists predict how future tsunamis would move through the water.",
            "As Owen assembled the maps, he noticed several large mounds on the bottom of the channel. Each covered many square kilometers. They looked like the mounds that a landslide would drop \u2014 except much bigger. Strewn along the seafloor were rectangular rocks the size of skyscrapers.",
            "\u201cSome of these individual blocks were bigger than the recent landslides\u201d that killed people, recalls Owen. (He now works at Global Maritime, a company in England that builds off-shore wind-energy farms.)",
            "When Owen showed these maps to Svennevig, they noticed something important. Each mound sat in front of a massive valley carved into the mountains above. Until then, no one had dared to think that those gouged valleys might be due to landslides. \u201cThey were just too big to comprehend,\u201d says Svennevig.",
            "Some were up to 100 times larger than the recent landslides. One had dumped up to 8.4 cubic kilometers (2 cubic miles) of rock onto the seafloor. That\u2019s enough to build 2,800 stacks of rock the size of the Empire State Building.",
            "Those landslides would have triggered enormous waves \u2014 many hundreds of meters high. Even 30 to 100 kilometers (18 to 60 miles) from where they formed, he found, waves had tossed rock and gravel as high as 70 meters (230 feet) up onto the land. At a similar distance, recent tsunamis like the one at Dickson Fjord had risen only about one-twentieth that high.",
            "These gigantic landslides likely happened at the end of the last Ice Age, some 7,000 to 10,000 years ago. That\u2019s when glaciers were retreating. And this rapid change destabilized the mountains.",
            "The Arctic\u2019s present-day warming could set the stage for a repeat of this, says Svennevig. \u201cWe should prepare for a future where these giant landslides can become a reality again.\u201d"

            "Installing a single row of flaps near the rear of an airfoil brought a different benefit. It blocked high-pressure air near the trailing edge of the wing from creeping toward the wing front. That\u2019s key, because low pressure is needed in the front to produce lift, Wissa explains. Adding five rows of flaps to airfoils improved lift by up to 45 percent. At the same time, it reduced drag by 31 percent.",
            "Further tests with remote-controlled aircraft showed that the bird-inspired flaps reduced stall and improved flight stability. That might be especially helpful while flying through heavy gusts, or during landings on very short runways.

            "Rather than walls, the second design focuses on roofs and how air flows indoors. Its passive radiative cooling draws from ancient designs used throughout many hot, dry parts of the world (think the Middle East or the U.S. Southwest).",
            "Long before there were air conditioners, ancient builders tinted or painted roofs and walls light colors to reflect the sun\u2019s warming rays back into space. These old homes also had thick, dense walls. The walls would absorb indoor heat by day and release it to the outdoors, slowly, at night. That slow release kept indoor air from getting too cold.",
            "The team drew from these classic ideas. Then it added a few modern innovations, explains Salmaan Craig. This building scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, led the project.",
            "For one, his group topped its structure\u2019s roof with a high-tech cover. It reflects the sun\u2019s warming rays while also emitting thermal energy that had been stored in the building. Then they designed strategically placed vents to allow air to move in and out. This set up a controlled mixing of warm and cool air.",
            "To test how well this design might keep interior spaces cool, Craig\u2019s team built a pair of small model \u201chomes.\u201d One included all the new features. The other modeled features and materials found in most of today\u2019s homes (although with no A/C).",
            "Then they placed four water bottles inside each model. Water absorbs and releases heat well. So these bottles acted as the thermal mass for the structures. Like the thick walls of ancient buildings, this mass absorbs indoor heat. Each model was then left for two days at a sunny desert site in Topanga, Calif. Sensors measured indoor heat and air flow in and out of each \u201chome.\u201d",
            "The new design stayed, on average, 1.6 \u00baC (2.9 \u00baF) cooler inside than the outside air. In contrast, the standard design was 4.3 \u00baC (7.7 \u00baF) warmer, on average, than the air outside.",
            "These results were good, but indoor temperatures kept going up and down, like a roller coaster. They varied by up to 6.8 \u00baC (12 \u00baF) over the day.",
            "To fix that, the team added two more water bottles to each home. This greater thermal mass helped indoor temps remain more stable. And the test home now drew in twice as much fresh air and expelled twice as much stale air as before.",
            "The average indoor temp was now 3.9 \u00baC (7.0 \u00baF) cooler than outside. It was 8.9 \u00baC (16 \u00baF) cooler than air in the standard-home model!",
            "Craig\u2019s team shared its findings last year in Cell Reports Physical Sciences.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",

            "And the latter one should be easier to maintain than a home with A/C, adds Purdue mechanical engineer Yun Zhang. She says \u201cshould\u201d because a move-in-ready model doesn\u2019t exist yet. A \u201ctest home\u201d does \u2014 but it\u2019s only the size of a carry-on suitcase.",
            "Zhang would also like to see studies to learn how dwellers might like them. Until someone tries to live in a full-size structure, she explains, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s comfortable.\u201d",
            "The Columbia team developed a new \u201call-season\u201d design to make its house more effective and comfortable year-round. The angles of pleats on its zigzag siding can be varied, depending on the season. They could be adjusted to maximize cooling in summer and warming in winter.",
            "Cheng\u2019s group described this innovation in the May 15 Cell Reports Physical Science. Similarly, Craig\u2019s team is working on a roof with adjustable thermal mass.",

            "Craig acknowledges these limitations. The findings, he says, should be seen as part of \u201ca spectrum of solutions.

            "In Earth\u2019s atmosphere, CO2 works like a blanket. It traps heat, warming our climate. Humans add a lot of CO2 to the air when they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil or natural gas, for energy. Carbon capture can reduce this climate-warming CO2 pollution.",
            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",
            "Hair-care practices might explain some of the difference, McMichael says. She and others have found differences in how often women of African and European ancestry shampoo their hair. Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",
            "And also use hair conditioners, McMichael advises. \u201cIt actually smooths the outer layer \u2014 the cuticle \u2014 much better than you can get with oil.\u201d Be careful about using hair sprays and gels, she adds. These can dry hair, increasing the risk that strands will break.",
            "In any case, if you notice a hair or scalp problem, talk to your doctor or another health-care expert right away. You might need help for dandruff. Or you might have a more serious skin or hair condition.",
            "\u201cThe earlier that you come in, the better off you are,\u201d McMichael says."
