            "Some of the world\u2019s smallest insects, like the featherwing beetle in this microscope image, have wings that look more like combs than membranes.",
            "The wings of many flying insects \u2014 bees, butterflies and dragonflies, for instance \u2014 seem to follow the same blueprint: A solid surface or membrane pushes against the air to keep these animals aloft. But new data show that for the tiniest fliers, there\u2019s a better way: brushes.",
            "The littlest insects are smaller than a grain of rice. Their wings look like tiny bristles or feather dusters, with visible air gaps throughout. It\u2019s a clever adaptation for flying when you\u2019re incredibly small, the new work shows.",
            "Bristled wings are light and surprisingly stiff. They also use less effort to flap than solid wings. This makes it easier for miniature insects to flap quickly and stay airborne \u2014\u00a0 important for moving through air that feels very different at their tiny scale.",
            "And understanding how these unusual wings work could also inspire new technology.",
            "\u201cCurrently, we have robotic insects the size of normal flying insects. But what would be nice is ultra-miniature robots, things you can\u2019t even see,\u201d says Mostafa Nabawy. He works at the University of Manchester in England and had no role in the new research. Bristled wings, this aerospace engineer suspects, might help make such super-mini robots possible.",
            "For more than a decade, Dmitry Kolomenskiy has been part of a team puzzling over why small insects evolved bristled wings. A computational scientist, he works at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. That\u2019s in Moscow, Russia.",
            "For answers, his team gathered data on 38 species of tiny beetles. Their wings ranged in length from just 0.3 to 5 millimeters (0.01 to 0.2 inch). That\u2019s very small \u2014 from the width of a couple hairs to about the size of a few grains of sand laid end to end. Many of the beetles came from Russia and Vietnam.",
            "Back in the lab, the researchers used microscopes to measure the shape of each wing and count its bristles. And with high-speed cameras, they tracked how fast the beetles\u2019 wings flapped in flight.",
            "To their surprise, the beetles flapped at about the same speed regardless of the wings\u2019 size. That\u2019s unusual, Kolomenskiy says. Among birds and larger insects, smaller wings usually flap faster.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/txPvulerOW4?feature=oembed",
            "This featherwing beetle flaps its bristled wings in a wide stroke. In 2022, Kolomenskiy and other scientists found that bristled wings help these tiny beetles fly very fast. Now, their research shows how the tiny bristles work and how their size and structure changes with a species\u2019 size.",
            "It comes down to how these wings interact with air, Kolomenskiy now concludes. To humans and other large animals, air feels light and breezy. But insects that are just a few millimeters long experience air very differently, he points out. \u201cAt these small scales, they really feel air like a very viscous media,\u201d he explains.",
            "\u201cThink of maple syrup,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get [that] kind of flow for air, if you are very small.\u201d",
            "Fluids, it turns out, behave differently at small scales. Viscous forces now dominate. Here, air doesn\u2019t easily slip through small gaps the way it does at larger scales. Instead, it flows slowly and sticks to surfaces, like syrup clinging to a spoon.",
            "As a result, tiny insects \u201care almost not flying in the air,\u201d says Nabawy, the aerospace engineer. \u201cThey are actually swimming in the air.\u201d",
            "Because the air acts like a thick, syrupy liquid, it doesn\u2019t flow through the gaps in a tiny wing\u2019s bristles. Instead, it gets \u201cstuck\u201d and flows around the bristles.",
            "\u201cVisually, it looks like there\u2019s a lot of void between [the bristles],\u201d says Kolomenskiy. \u201cBut for the [air], it\u2019s not transparent. The flow goes around.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The smaller the insect, the stickier the air can feel. So the researchers created a computer model. It analyzed what design would allow these tiny insects to flap with the least effort before their flight performance suffers.",
            "This model looked at how stiff the bristles need to be so they won\u2019t bend. It also tested how widely bristles can be spaced without leaking air.",

At about 0.05 millimeter (two thousandths of an inch), it is about half the thickness of a human hair! It lives in mushrooms and probably eats tiny bits of fungus.",
            "Gaps between bristles increased as a wing got smaller, they found. The tiniest wings (0.3 to 0.5 millimeter) had the fewest bristles, and they were spaced farthest apart. Wings with fewer bristles weigh less. That helps these insects flap at high speeds without using much energy, Kolomenskiy observes.",
            "Longer wings \u2014 those more than about 1.7 millimeters \u2014 evolved more bristles and ones that are more closely spaced. As those bristles get very tightly packed, they eventually start to look more like a membrane.",

            "Lastly, the team looked at wing stiffness. Wings that bend too much as they flap don\u2019t push hard enough against the air to generate lift. That\u2019s the force needed to keep things aloft. The computer model showed that both the bristles and what they attach to need enough rigidity to hold the wing\u2019s shape during each flap.",

For instance, swarms of tiny flying robots \u2014 sometimes called \u201crobobees\u201d \u2014 could flit through greenhouses to pollinate crops. Alternatively, squadrons of micro-drones might search collapsed buildings for survivors or monitor things in the environment.",

Some of us see pinecones everywhere during the winter: in wreaths, on trees and in our yards. But did you know that pinecones have a vital job? They keep pine tree seeds safe and protect them from the freezing temperatures during the winter.",
            "To protect their precious seeds, pinecones can close their \u201cscales\u201d tightly, keeping out cold temperatures, winds, ice and even animals that might eat the seeds.",
            "In this activity, we will observe how pinecones respond to different temperatures by mimicking changes in weather, all from the safety of our own kitchens. As an added bonus, after this activity your pinecones will be ready to be added to your house as a holiday decoration or as a beautiful reminder of the plants of the season.",
            "Did you know that pinecones can stay on pine trees for over 10 years before falling to the ground?\u00a0During that time, seeds for new pine trees grow under the scales of the pinecones. The scales protect the seeds from bad weather and from animals that might eat them. However, eventually the seeds need to be released so that they can grow into new pine trees.",
            "To make sure that the seeds have the best chance of finding fertile soil and growing into trees, the pinecone scales stay tightly closed when the weather is inhospitable to new seed growth. For instance, when it\u2019s very cold and damp outside. In contrast, when the weather is hot and dry, the seeds will have an easier time finding good soil and growing into trees. In these conditions, the pinecone scales will open, allowing seeds to escape and drift away, to find new ground to grow into new trees.",

In the first part of the activity, you may have noticed that placing pinecone A in the cold water caused the circumference of the pinecone to decrease. This is the expected result. In response to cold and damp conditions, pinecone scales close tightly, making a natural shell to protect the precious seeds inside.\u00a0",
            "After taking pinecone A and B out of the oven, you measured all of the pinecones to get their final measurements. When you compared the final measurement of pinecone A to the cold-water measurements, you should have observed that the circumference of pinecone A increased after being in the hot oven. In addition, when you compared the final measurements to the initial measurements for all the pinecones, you may have noticed that the circumference of pinecones A and B both increased. ",

Three scientists who did pivotal work to understand these peacemakers will take home this year\u2019s 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.",

            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change?

This junk includes discarded rocket boosters, old satellites and fragments left over when objects collide. In 2009, for example, two satellites crashed nearly 800 kilometers (about 500 miles) above Siberia. The crash created thousands of new pieces of space junk.",

            "Space junk is a growing problem. That\u2019s because it shares the same, well, space, as other objects that orbit Earth. One of those objects is the International Space Station. There\u2019s also weather, communication and other satellites people on Earth rely on.",
            "Objects in orbit around Earth typically zoom at scorching speeds. Space junk can zip around at up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) per second \u2014 or 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles) per hour. At such speeds, any collision \u2014 even with something tiny \u2014 could rip holes in a spacecraft or damage satellites.",
            "More than 36,500 pieces of space junk larger than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) orbit Earth today. They\u2019re joined by more than 300 million even smaller pieces. As more trash ends up in space, more collisions will likely occur. Those collisions will break the trash into smaller \u2014 but still dangerous \u2014 pieces.",
            "Some space junk eventually re-enters the atmosphere. But that can take a long time. Debris orbiting closer to the Earth may fall into the atmosphere after a few years. Objects farther out may take hundreds or thousands of years.",
            "On re-entry, smaller space junk typically burns up in the atmosphere. So, it rarely hits Earth. But large pieces sometimes do. Debris from Skylab \u2014 an abandoned space station \u2014 fell from orbit on July 11, 1979. Chunks of the station fell over Western Australia and the Indian Ocean. Australian officials fined NASA $400 for littering.",

            "One clue to where water came from is how much of it is \u201csemi-heavy.\u201d In semi-heavy water molecules, one hydrogen is replaced with a hefty form of the element called deuterium. Deuterium contains a neutron in its nucleus along with a single proton. Instead of H2O, semi-heavy water is HDO.",

The researchers compared that ratio with the ice and gas around other baby stars, including slightly older ones. That suggested that the HDO to H2O ratio around a star might not change much as the star evolves. The team also compared L1527\u2019s HDO to H2O ratio with that of the ice seen on comets and meteorites in our solar system.",
            "The team shared its findings in the June 20 Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
            "These observations offer new details about what happens to water as stars mature. This may help scientists figure out where Earth\u2019s water came from.

            "In the 1980s, John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis turned up weird effects in special types of electric circuits. The effects involved billions of electrons. And they took place on a device big enough to hold in one\u2019s hand.",
            "Their discoveries challenged what scientists had believed. Previously, they had thought that quantum effects mainly showed up in tiny objects such as single atoms.",
            "Quantum theory describes the behavior of particles or energy on the smallest scale. It predicts that particles can do some unexpected tricks. One of those tricks is called quantum tunneling. That\u2019s when a particle slips through a barrier that\u2019s seemingly impassible.",

But those weird behaviors give quantum computers\u00a0the potential to perform special feats. Those devices could help find new medicines or useful materials. Or they could break the internet.

            "The researchers took a superconductor and layered it with an insulator. That\u2019s a material that doesn\u2019t conduct electricity. It was like a sandwich with superconductor as the bread and insulator as the filling. This makes what is called a Josephson junction. (The junction, here, is the boundary between the superconductor and the insulator.)",

            "In college, shark researcher Heidy Martinez earned degrees in psychology and anthropology. This background helps her better understand how people learn about and interact with sharks, she says. ",
            "Heidy Martinez never dreamt of studying sharks. That changed during a study abroad trip in South Africa in college. She went cage diving with some classmates. That\u2019s when divers view sharks underwater while inside a protective cage. Martinez was mostly there for the thrill. \u201cI really just wanted to scare [my classmates].\u201d",
            "The boat ride was proving to be a bummer. The waves were choppy. Martinez\u2019s wetsuit didn\u2019t fit. And everyone was feeling seasick. When she entered the ocean, a woman beside her said she felt ill. \u201cAll of a sudden, she pukes,\u201d Martinez recalls. \u201cThen a wave comes, so all that puke just lands on me and my face.\u201d\u00a0",
            "At that moment, a white shark approached the cage. To see the shark, Martinez immediately dived, puke and all. But the sight was worth it, she says. Movies usually show these sharks as bloody predators. But this white shark looked entirely different. \u201cI was shocked at how beautiful the shark was,\u201d she says. \u201cSeeing that white shark was a pivotal moment in my career.\u201d",
            "Today, Martinez is a freelance shark researcher. She works with different organizations to study how these fish live and to explore ways to protect them. In this interview, she shares her experiences and advice with Science News Explores. (This interview has been edited for content and readability.)\u00a0 \u00a0",
            "My degrees are in anthropology and psychology. So I began applying to psychology labs after graduating college. I was convinced that was what I was going to do with my life. Then I saw a documentary on shark conservation called Sharkwater. That film helped me tell the difference between loving something and having a passion for it. I loved psychology and anthropology, but I felt passionate about the ocean.",
            "It felt really scary when I finally decided to switch careers in my mid-20s. I decided to have a conversation with my parents to see if they supported my decision. I was afraid that they would think everything I\u2019d done so far was a waste of time. My family left Colombia when I was 6 so that I could have a better future. But my dad actually got teary-eyed when I told them about my career change. He explained that he had wanted to study marine biology, too. But the career counselors at his school told him to give up that dream.\u00a0",
            "It felt like this full-circle moment. My dad left everything behind so I could do what I love. And that job ended up being what he always wanted to do.\u00a0",

            "fCOn one assignment to Terra Ceia Bay, near Sarasota, Fla., Martinez tagged small blacknose sharks.",
            "After I watched the documentary, I wanted to see if this was actually what I wanted to do. That meant I needed to do fieldwork before deciding on grad school.\u00a0",
            "I connected with a project in Nicaragua that created olive ridley sea turtle hatcheries. From there, one opportunity often led to another. People I\u2019d work with during a project would tell me about other opportunities. That often allowed me to pick up different skills. I was working a gig taking pictures of corals for a national park in Thailand when COVID hit. I was stuck there for about five months.\u00a0",
            "I realized that I needed to find something more committed. In 2022, I worked as a research assistant studying whale sharks in the Philippines. That led to my current job working as a ship biologist in Mexico. Becoming a member of the group Minorites in Shark Sciences also catapulted my career. They offer opportunities and support to minorities that they don\u2019t usually get in the sciences. \u00a0",
            "It offers me amazing opportunities to work with different species of sharks. Working with different organizations allows me to really improve my skills. It\u2019s also made me more adaptable. I\u2019m constantly working with new people on different boats. Each team has a different way of doing things. And every boat has its own setup.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "My life can feel really exhausting. Since I\u2019m constantly traveling, I don\u2019t have a place to sleep. My backpack is my home. Earlier this year, I found myself in a new location every week. I\u2019ve been doing this for the past five years or so. It\u2019s unstable, but it\u2019s also worth the sacrifice.\u00a0",
            "I spent many years feeling like my education was a complete waste of time. But just because I don\u2019t have a marine biology degree doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know how to do the work. I\u2019ve had to learn everything on the job.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "My friends remind me that graduate school will always be there. These job opportunities won\u2019t. I am, though, hoping to get my master\u2019s in the next couple of years.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "I now understand that my degrees have shaped me into the scientist and conservationist I am today. My anthropology side allows me to consider cultural differences. And my psychology degree helps with understanding how people receive and interpret information.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "For example, clam divers in the Gulf of Mexico have lost their lives to shark encounters. And of course, naturally, their reaction is to hate sharks. A lot of scientists will try to preach or lecture the fishermen about how sharks don\u2019t regularly attack clam divers. But listening to their concerns should be an important part of that work. Studying psychology taught me that if you want people to listen to you, you have to listen to them first.\u00a0",

            "My biggest sacrifice has been giving up much of my personal life. Living from boat to boat has meant not having enough opportunities to take care of my well-being.",
            "I remember being on a ship when my mom passed away. Everyone was supportive but there was nowhere to run or to hide. I was stuck in the middle of the ocean. Every crew member counts on a boat, so you can\u2019t take time off. Much of my work involves handling stuff very differently than the average person.",
            "When you\u2019re facing 55-knot winds and feeling sick, you sometimes wonder why you\u2019re doing this. But it\u2019s not just a job for me. I can\u2019t see myself doing anything else. I\u2019m working on having both a successful career and a fulfilling personal life. I\u2019m very excited to see how those two play out.\u00a0",

            "Katalin Karik\u00f3 thought the call was a joke. It was 3 a.m. on October 2, 2023. Her husband answered the phone. As someone who maintains buildings, \u201che quite frequently gets calls for fixing this and that,\u201d Karik\u00f3 says. But this time he handed it over. \u201cIt is for you,\u201d he said.",
            "Only half awake, Karik\u00f3 heard a scientist from Sweden congratulate her: Karik\u00f3 had won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.",
            "Karik\u00f3 works at the University of Szeged in Hungary. She also works at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where she had been asleep that day in October. A biochemist, she has spent much of her career studying messenger RNA. This molecule carries instructions from a cell\u2019s DNA so they can be translated into proteins.",
            "Karik\u00f3 and her colleague Drew Weissman learned how to tweak that RNA. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, their findings allowed other scientists to leap into action. In less than a year, scientist teams made a vaccine using mRNA. So thanks to Karik\u00f3, you may have gotten a vaccine to protect you from COVID-19.",
            "This work definitely sounds worthy of a big prize. And the Nobel is the biggest science prize of them all. Winners receive a solid gold medal imprinted with the face of Alfred Nobel (more on him later). They also get a large cash prize to split among as many as three scientists in each field.",
            "In 2024, the 11 million Swedish kroner prize was valued at about $1 million U.S. (Karik\u00f3 shared this prize with Weissmann, also a biochemist at the University of Pennsylvania.) Every year, the Nobel Foundation awards prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. Sweden\u2019s central bank also gives a prize in economics.",

            "Scientists who win a Nobel Prize are famous while they\u2019re alive \u2014 and that fame will live on in history books for years after. This may lead others to care what the winners think \u2014 even in areas where the scientists might not be experts.",
            "But Nobel Prizes spotlight only a narrow slice of science \u2014 and very few scientists.",
            "Many fields of science don\u2019t fit the prize categories. And only three people can share one prize, even though hundreds may have worked on a discovery. Most of those others end up unrecognized for their role in prize-winning work.",
            "The Nobel Prizes also tend to honor people \u2014 mostly men \u2014 in wealthy countries.",
            "Prizes can be important. They may inspire young scientists. The hubbub around these prizes tells the general public that science matters. But the scientists who choose the winners are human and bring their own values and biases to the process. So which scientists get celebrated \u2014 and which don\u2019t \u2014 can be political and sometimes biased. \u00a0",
            "These prizes are named for Alfred Nobel, a Swedish chemist in the 1800s. His most famous invention was dynamite. He designed the explosive to help build railroads more safely and to tunnel through rocks while mining. But it also was soon used for war and violence. Over time, Nobel grew fabulously wealthy from dynamite and his other inventions.",
            "Nobel had planned to leave his fortune to relatives. But in 1888, his brother, Ludvig, died. At the time, a newspaper in Paris, France, made a mistake. They printed an obituary for Alfred, not Ludvig. (An obituary is a news story at someone\u2019s death outlining their life and achievements.) This story was titled: \u201cThe merchant of death is dead.\u201d It pointed to how Nobel\u2019s inventions had killed many people in battle.",

            "Nobel never said how he felt about reading his own death notice in the morning paper. But \u201che saw himself described in rather unflattering terms,\u201d says Marshall Lichtman, a physician and teacher. Lichtman, who works at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, wrote a 2017 article on Alfred Nobel and the Nobel Prize.",
            "Seven years after reading his premature obituary, Nobel decided his fortune would fund what has come to be called Nobel Prizes. Sweden, his home country, would choose the winners. Nobel specified that he wanted awards in chemistry, physics, physiology or medicine, literature and peace.",
            "Nobel probably didn\u2019t intend for the prize to become like the Olympics of science, Lichtman says. \u201cWhat he was hoping to do, I think, was to provide [winners] with a prize that would allow them to continue this exceptional work.\u201d",
            "The Nobel Prizes quickly became famous. One reason: There weren\u2019t other big prizes like it. And these prizes would be open to everyone. \u201cThat meant that the very best people in the world were going to be recognized,\u201d Lichtman says.",
            "If Nobel\u2019s plan had been to change his reputation, it worked. Now he isn\u2019t known as \u201cthe merchant of death.\u201d Instead, he\u2019s the founder of a prize that makes people think of scientific genius.",
            "Choosing who wins Nobels takes almost a year. It\u2019s a huge honor to be involved, says Juleen Zierath. She\u2019s a physiologist, someone who studies the human body, at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.",
            "She\u2019s also part of the 50-person assembly that works with a smaller committee to choose who wins the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Zierath was the first woman to chair a Nobel committee and remains in the assembly.",
            "Every year, scientists around the world have from September to January to nominate candidates for the Physiology or Medicine prize to the Karolinska Institutet. Nominations for the physics and chemistry prizes go to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, nominations for the peace prize go to a group in Norway. And nominations for literature go to The Swedish Academy.",
            "Only invited people can submit those nominations. These are very accomplished scientists and previous prize winners. And they cannot nominate themselves. \u00a0",
            "After the nominations come in, a smaller committee gets to work.",
            "To sort through the hundreds of nominations, the committee pulls in more scientists. Experts in what the nominated scientists study will prepare reports describing what the nominees have done. These must be turned in by August. They\u2019ll be evaluated in September. In the meantime, the smaller committee consults back and forth with the 50-person assembly.",
            "\u201cWe are only allowed to award a discovery,\u201d not a person, Zierath explains. \u201cSo we have to sort through who\u2019s been nominated. Are these people the right people? Did they really make a discovery? \u2026 We have to think a lot.\u201d Once the committee has made a short list of especially good candidates, they send it to the assembly.",
            "The final vote for the Physiology or Medicine prize takes place on the first Monday of every October. (Other prizes get voted on later in the week.) It starts at 9 a.m. in Sweden. The voting is kept a tight secret. The voting room has double doors. No one can bring a phone or laptop.",
            "In another room, journalists from all over the world wait to hear the results. But first, each winner gets a call.",

            "Soon after Karik\u00f3 received her call in 2023, the three phones in her house began ringing nonstop. By 7 a.m., journalists were knocking on her door. When Karik\u00f3 answered, she got her picture taken still wearing her pajamas.",

            "Winning a Nobel Prize means your life will never be the same, says Victor Ambros. He works at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in Worchester. A developmental biologist, he studies how organisms grow. And he took home a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2024 for discovering microRNAs. These tiny bits of genetic material help control how cells make proteins.",
            "Nobel\u2019s goal with his prize was to help support scientists with the prize money \u2014 to let them keep doing their work. Ironically, Ambros has less time than ever to do research.",
            "\u201cBefore this, I was working in the lab and doing experiments,\u201d he says. \u201cI have not been able to get back to that.\u201d He is constantly traveling to give talks.

            "In a way, the Nobel Prize is famous just because it\u2019s famous. \u201cIf you look at the media attention, there is no other prize worldwide that can compete with [it],\u201d says Nils Hansson. He\u2019s a science historian who studies the Nobel Prize at Heinrich-Heine University in Dusseldorf, Germany.",
            "Journalists tell him that they don\u2019t generally cover science prizes \u2014 except the Nobels. \u201cThe brand of the Nobel is so much bigger and more well known than the laureates,\u201d he notes.",
            "Most scientists \u2014 even very successful ones \u2014 will never win a Nobel Prize. Those who do tend to look a certain way. Most are men and tend to be white. They\u2019re also usually from wealthy places like the United States or Europe.",
            "When Katalin Karik\u00f3 won her Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, she joined the small group of women who have attained a Nobel Prize in a scientific field. Since the first prizes were awarded in 1901, 25 women have been awarded one of these prizes. Polish-French scientist Marie Curie is the only woman to have won two Nobel Prizes: Physics in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911.",

            "The assemblies work hard to avoid bias, says Zierath. \u201cWe\u2019re 50 members on this assembly \u2026 to ensure it is not one person [making] a decision,\u201d she explains. And \u201cwe\u2019re not restricting our nominations to only one region,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching people throughout the world and requesting that they nominate.\u201d",
            "But most of these awards in science still go to people from the United States or Europe. That\u2019s largely because these regions have long invested in funding science and encouraging people to become scientists, Zierath notes. However, bias \u2014 preferring one type of person or country or discovery over another \u2014 can creep into decision-making. The assembly knows this. \u201cOne way to try to deal with biases is to identify that you have them,\u201d she says.",
            "To be seen as prizeworthy, scientists have to make big discoveries. Often, this means working in big labs at important universities. This can be hard to do if someone comes from a low-income area or country, is a member of a minority or faces other challenges.",
            "People of color or white women face a lot of barriers to succeeding in science, notes Harriet Zuckerman. She\u2019s a sociologist \u2014 someone who studies how people behave together \u2014 at Columbia University in New York City. There\u2019s an \u201carray of obstacles that line the course of women\u2019s careers,\u201d she says. These \u201cmake it less likely\u201d for them to reach a place where they can do the type of work likely to win a prize.",

            "And of course, of the impressive scientists considered, only three people can win for any discovery. Those scientists are most often the heads of their labs. Others who work in the labs may go unrecognized.",
            "Ambros, for example, won the 2024 Nobel Prize with collaborator Gary Ruvkun. Ruvkun is a geneticist at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Mass. But Ambros\u2019 wife, Rosalind Lee, is a scientist, too. She manages Ambros\u2019 lab and contributed just as much to the work. She, however, did not share the Nobel Prize.",

            "The Nobel Foundation is unlikely to change anything about these prizes. They are largely bound by limits that Alfred Nobel wrote into his will, such as: Three or fewer scientists per prize. Only discoveries are awarded. And in science, only discoveries in physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine will be considered.",
            "That leaves out a lot of science. \u201cWhere does ecology fit in?\u201d asks Robert Marc Friedman, a historian of science at the University of Oslo in Norway. Or the study of oceans? Weather and climate? Geology? Discoveries in these fields can be just as important as those in physics, chemistry or medicine. But most won\u2019t qualify for a Nobel Prize.",
            "People also shouldn\u2019t make the mistake that all Nobel Prize winners are geniuses on everything, Friedman says. Doing great work in physics, for example, doesn\u2019t mean a scientist may know anything about politics or medicine. In fact, it may only mean they know a lot about one area of physics.",
            "Still, Lichtman thinks that the Nobel Prize is important. It shines a light on science as a whole. \u201cThe average person doesn\u2019t sit at home and say, \u2018Boy, I hope there are a lot of good people going into chemistry or going into physics,\u2019\u201d he says. The Nobel Prize shows the world that science can change our lives.",
            "Ambros agrees \u2014 and not just because he won one. \u201cIt\u2019s all about science and celebrating science,\u201d he notes. \u201cI\u2019ve talked more about my research publicly in the last couple of months than I did in my whole previous career.\u201d When people have heard he won the Nobel Prize, they don\u2019t only get curious about him and his work \u2014 they get curious about science.",

It came about from natural breeding events between an early tomato plant and a potato-like species.",
            "This ancient cross gave rise to the plant\u2019s swollen stem parts, known as tubers. Tubers eventually spread through some 180 wild species of potatoes and thousands of cultivated varieties. Scientists from around the world shared the new findings in the September 18 issue of Cell.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The cultivated potato \u2014 Solanum tuberosum \u2014 is one of the world\u2019s most important staple foods. Scientists knew it was related to Solanum etuberosum, a South American plant. That species looks a lot like our potato plant. It just can\u2019t form tubers, those parts that we turn into fries, baked potatoes and chips.",
            "Genetics had shown that potatoes are related to tomatoes. But scientists thought the two plants were like distant cousins. Instead, research now shows, species from these two lines interbred.",
            "The team peeled back the potato\u2019s origin by analyzing dozens of wild and cultivated varieties of potato. About half of the genes in every potato species traced to the tomato, the rest to S. etuberosum.",
            "This suggests potatoes came from a single hybrid cross of these two groups, says Sandra Knapp. She\u2019s a botanist at the Natural History Museum in London, England.",
            "\u201cIn creating that hybrid offspring, various gene families came together and interacted to enable the creation of tubers,\u201d she says.",
            "One gene \u2014 SP6A \u2014 came from the tomato side. Previous studies had shown it works as a master switch for tuber initiation. Another gene \u2014 IT1 \u2014 is key to the growth of underground stems that form tubers. It came from S. etuberosum.",
            "Experiments in potato plants now confirmed that without the IT1 gene, tubers are tiny. Without SP6A, tubers don\u2019t even form.",
            "How combining these genes in one plant \u201cled to potatoes making potatoes isn\u2019t fully explained in this paper,\u201d says Salom\u00e9 Prat. She\u2019s a plant biologist who did not take part in the new study. She works at the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics. That\u2019s in Barcelona, Spain. Showing that these genes came together from a natural cross does not mean tubers formed right away, she adds. \u201cThe story is much more complicated.\u201d",
            "How interbreeding led to tubers shows that hybrid crosses can be a powerful driver of evolution. Some new hybrids can be sterile (unable to reproduce). But tubers store water and nutrients. And if left buried, they can sprout new plants. No pollination or seeds are needed.",
            "This likely gave the new potato lines time to regain an ability to reproduce sexually. And the new tuber structures may have given early potato plants an edge as the Andes began to form millions of years ago.",
            "Tomatoes prefer dry, warm conditions. S. etuberosum thrives in cold, wet places. Potatoes inherited a mix of traits that allowed them to flourish even in cold, dry sites. They got \u201cthe best of both worlds,\u201d Knapp says. And changing habitats in the Andes might have given these new species opportunities to thrive.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Most of today\u2019s 180 wild potato species are bitter or toxic. But many thousands of years ago, Indigenous people in the Andes found a tasty wild potato. Over time, they developed many varieties from it. Spanish explorers later brought several of them to Europe. This led to the potato\u2019s global spread as a food staple.",
            "More recently, scientists and farmers have crossed potato species to get traits such as high yield or pathogen resistance. Many of these lost some of the potato\u2019s initial genetic variability. That makes today\u2019s potatoes less adaptable \u2014 and more vulnerable \u2014 to extreme heat, flooding and other features of our changing climate.",
            "Identifying the genes inherited from the early tomato and S. etuberosum might lead to a more resilient potato. Lost traits might be restored through traditional breeding or genetic engineering. And that, Knapp says, might lead to more adaptable varieties."

            "Nobel\u2019s will directed that one award go to recognize outstanding literature. Another should reward the fostering of international peace. Nobel also wanted to reward scientific discovery. So three awards would celebrate discoveries or inventions in physics, chemistry and physiology or medicine. All five awards would come with a cash prize. That prize is now about 11 million Swedish krona (around $1 million, depending on the exchange rate in any given year). If there are two winners in a category, they split the money equally. If there are three, one person gets half the money, and the other two split the other half.",
            "Every year, thousands of scientists around the world are invited to nominate people for a Nobel Prize. (No one can nominate themselves.) Groups at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden, evaluate nominees for the physics and chemistry prizes.

Their short lists then move on to a selection committee for each subject. Those committees vote on who will receive the prize that year \u2014 or whether no one should receive it.",
            "The first set of Nobel Prizes was handed out in 1901. Now, the Nobel Prize \u201cis reckoned the world championship of science.

            "The prize is also notable for being international. These awards can go to scientists anywhere, not just in Nobel\u2019s home country of Sweden. The prize became \u201ca way in which nations could compete peacefully,\u201d Friedman says.",
            "As a result, the Nobel Prize received a lot of media attention. \u201cFrom the beginning, the main scientific journals wrote about the Nobels,\u201d Hansson says. Now, Nobel Prize winners are front page news.",
            "The Nobel Prize helped to make some scientists household names, observes Harriet Zuckerman. She is a sociologist \u2014 someone who studies the social behaviors of people \u2014 at Columbia University in New York City. \u201cIt calls attention to science, which is to my mind as worthy as filmmaking and pop music \u2014 the things that most people tend to give a lot of value,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also calls attention to people who do not necessarily come from families of great wealth. [They] succeed because they are driven by a desire to work hard and a desire to make a contribution.\u201d",
            "With a few exceptions, the Nobel Prizes have honored good science, not pseudoscientific (SU-doh-sy-en-TIF-ik) fads. A bigger issue is that there are many more impressive scientific achievements than there are Nobel Prizes. \u201cA lot of scientists who do [good] work \u2026 get passed over because there can only be a limited number of winners,\u201d notes Zuckerman.",
            "Even scientists who participated in a discovery might not win a Nobel. The committees that initially set the prize rules decided that a maximum of three people in any category could win each year. Back then, many scientists worked alone or in small groups. But this means that if there was a fourth scientist in a group, they were out of luck. Now, scientists often work in large groups to make major discoveries. In a team of 100, which three would deserve to share that year\u2019s Nobel Prize?",
            "\u201cIn the early days, the people who made the rules couldn\u2019t have imagined how science would change,\u201d Zuckerman says. \u201cMore than a century has passed, so there\u2019s a historical mismatch between the rules that govern the prize and how science is now.\u201d",
            "This also means that when a committee can\u2019t find just a few scientists to get the credit, no one might get credit at all. For example, many scientists worked on the invention of anesthesia. This is the ability to stop someone from feeling pain, or to render them unconscious. Anesthesia completely changed medicine. It let doctors perform delicate surgeries without causing terrible suffering. \u201cMany people worked on the methods,\u201d Hansson says. But for the Nobel Prize, it was too many. The committee for physiology or medicine couldn\u2019t find three people who contributed the most. So no one ever received a Nobel Prize for this achievement.",
            "Also, Nobel Prizes reward achievements in only three scientific areas. In fact, much of science occurs in areas beyond those fields. Say some scientist had figured out how to accurately predict earthquakes. That could save many lives. \u201cIt would perfectly meet the notion of Alfred Nobel to benefit mankind,\u201d Friedman notes. Unfortunately, Earth science is not eligible for a Nobel Prize.",
            "This can be a problem when universities or institutions use the Nobel Prize as a measure of their own importance, Friedman notes. Scientific fields like astronomy or mathematics might not get as much prestige because their scientists can\u2019t win a Nobel.",
            "Some universities put a lot of effort into hiring and keeping Nobel Prize winners. This is something Friedman worries is not good for science. \u201cShould science be like sports, just buying the best guys and getting your rankings?\u201d Nobel Prizes indicate important discoveries, he notes, but \u201cwhat does that say about the university, the quality of life or the quality of [its] teaching?\u201d",
            "Between 1901 and 2024, only 13 of the 229 total winners in physiology or medicine have been women. Only eight women over that period have ever won the Nobel Prize in chemistry. Just five have won it in physics. For minority scientists, the numbers are even worse. No black scientist has ever taken home a Nobel Prize.",
            "*a_photo_of_Marie_Curie",
            "fCMarie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and she is still the only woman to have won it twice. She won the physics prize in 1903 and the chemistry prize in 1911.",
            "This lack of diversity is a problem. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the prizes but the reward system of science,\u201d Zuckerman says. \u201cThere\u2019s been a tendency to not recognize the work of people who aren\u2019t from the right countries or the right sex.\u201d Candidates also tend to come from a relatively few universities or research centers, she notes. Among them: the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard University, in Cambridge, Mass.",
            "But things are changing, Zuckerman says. Important scientific societies, such as the National Academy of Sciences in the United States and the Royal Society in the United Kingdom, now let in more women and people of color. These societies help scientists get recognized by their peers. And the more women and minorities that become recognized, the more likely they are to receive a Nobel Prize. Between 1901 and 2001, only 10 women received a Nobel Prize in science. Within the next 15 years, another eight won them. That hardly seems fair, Zuckerman notes, \u201cbut it\u2019s better than it was.\u201d",
            "While Nobel Prize winners have done amazing work, there are many scientists who will never get the golden medal or the big cash prize. Still, the allure of the award remains strong. \u201cI asked freshmen at the California Institute of Technology what the goal was for [their] careers in science,\u201d says Friedman. \u201cNinety percent said their goal was to win a Nobel Prize.\u201d But there are so few Nobel Prizes, most, if not all, of those students will be disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to Las Vegas believing you\u2019ll become a millionaire,\u201d says Friedman.",
            "Not winning a Nobel Prize won\u2019t make those students failures, however. \u201cYes, the brilliant insight of a brilliant scientist is important,\u201d Friedman says. \u201cBut it\u2019s only of importance when you have a community and networks of people working together.\u201d",
            "Editor\u2019s note: This post was updated on October 5, 2022, to revise the number of women who have won Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry. It was updated again on October 4, 2023, to revise the value of the cash award and the numbers of women who have won Nobel prizes in medicine or physiology and physics.

            "Peeling tape can create a separation of positive and negative charges that triggers lightning \u2014 micro-lightning. These sparks of energy, illustrated here, may one day be put to useful work.",
            "Rip off a piece of tape in a dark room and you may see a flash of light. This happens because the peeling tape releases energy that creates tiny sparks. It might seem like just a neat little trick. But scientists have now shown this \u201cmicro-lightning\u201d is shockingly powerful. In fact, it can be strong enough to drive chemical reactions in the air.",
            "One day, such micro-sparks could help make some chemicals in a more sustainable way.",
            "\u201cI\u2019ve been very interested in the idea of micro-lightning,\u201d says Richard Zare. A chemist, he works at Stanford University in California. His team recently showed sprays of water release tiny sparks that can drive chemical reactions. Now, working with Xinxing Zhang, a physical chemist in China, his team is studying micro-lightning sparked by peeling tape.",
            "fCWatch the glow from electrons jumping as tape is peeled off a roll in the dark.",
            "Using tape was Zhang\u2019s idea. Ripping tape loose from its roll releases visible light. But Zhang knew it also, surprisingly, generates X-rays. He wondered how high this electric charge was and if it sparked chemical reactions. To find out, his team at Nankai University in Tianjin set up an experiment.\u00a0",
            "They started with a roll of sticky tape placed on a bearing. With a motor, they pulled off the tape and wound it around a cylinder. Along the way, the team measured the strength of the electric field that the peeling tape created. They also looked for any changes in the chemistry of the surrounding air.",
            "The test setup pulls tape off a roll and onto a cylinder. A motor controls its speed. The unrolling tape sits on a device (XY translational stage) that can move back and forth. This positions the peeling point in front of a mass spectrometer (Extended MS inlet), which identifies chemicals formed as the zapping triggers air chemicals to react.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_tape_test_setup_used_in_the_lab",
            "fCXufeng Gao",
            "Peeling the tape slowly, at 12.5 centimeters (5 inches) per second, created a small electric field. But when the motor sped up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) per second, the space where the tape left the roll became very highly charged. Zhang\u2019s group tallied a billion volts per meter across this tiny space!",
            "That\u2019s an astonishing voltage \u2014 far beyond what\u2019s usually achieved in the lab, Zare points out. (For perspective, lightning shoots from a storm cloud when the voltage is 3 million volts per meter. In the tape experiment, the high voltage is across too small of a space for the micro-lightning to hurt us.)",
            "The peeling tape\u2019s zap illustrates the triboelectric effect. This is the generation of an electric charge as materials come into contact and then separate. It\u2019s like static electricity, when two objects are rubbed together then moved apart. One object becomes positively charged, meaning it loses electrons. The other gains those lost electrons and becomes negatively charged. (This can make a negatively charged balloon repel electrons from a wall, then \u201cstick\u201d to the positively charged surface. Or, it can send out a tiny zap of electricity.)",
            "The triboelectric effect is at work all around us \u2014 in things as simple as a sliding raindrop and the rustle of our clothes. But the tape experiment created a much higher voltage than most other everyday triboelectric events. Why? Being sticky, the tape peeled off the roll in a jerky way. Scientists call this a \u201cstick\u2013slip\u201d event. It leads to higher charges than when things just rub together or touch.",
            "A high electric field emerged only when the tape was pulled quickly, Zare says. If that electric field is high enough, electrons from the tape will speed up and smash into air molecules or other molecules in the tape. This \u201cleads to a spark that drives chemical reactions,\u201d says Zare. Those electrons flowing between the tape\u2019s surfaces can create a high enough voltage around the tape to break down molecules in the air, he says \u2014 turning them into ions.",
            "Zare\u2019s team repeated what Zhang\u2019s team had done. This time, they also looked to see if molecules of water vapor in the air near the tape would break up and form into new molecules. They did.",
            "Next, Zare\u2019s group put chemicals they suspected would react as vapors in the electric field next to the peeling tape. This was to test a common reaction used in industrial chemistry. (It\u2019s one where pyridine and methyl iodide are reacted to form something new.) Right away, Zare\u2019s group detected new products as these chemicals now reacted.",
            "The team shared its new findings June 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

            "\u201cThis is a fabulous discovery,\u201d says Thalappil Pradeep. A chemist, he studies triboelectricity at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai. There is a lot to discover about what\u2019s happening at the tiny space where the peeling tape first makes contact with the air, he says.",
            "Daniel Lacks agrees. This chemical engineer works at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually look at what\u2019s happening in that little, teeny distance\u201d between two nearly touching surfaces, he says. His own work has focused on particles that pick up an electric charge after rubbing against each other.\u00a0",
            "Lacks finds it \u201cvery cool\u201d that the electric fields created by tape get so high they can drive chemical reactions.",

            "Simone Ciampi works with triboelectric effects at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. What surprised him was the beauty and simplicity of the new experiment.",
            "Guiding chemical reactions with triboelectricity is one type of green chemistry, Ciampi notes. Here, electricity can do work typically done by chemicals that may be toxic. So this approach, he concludes, can be more environmentally friendly.",
            "Chemicals often react through a series of steps. Some may require separating positive and negative charges within a molecule. By controlling those electric charges, you can manage the reaction\u2019s steps to help choose what product you end up with, Ciampi explains.",
            "Indeed, a huge number of chemical reactions are sensitive to electric fields. But there\u2019s often a challenge in using an electric field to guide reactions. The problem, Ciampi says, is the electrically conducting materials used to make the field. Those materials can interfere with the reacting chemicals, which could prevent the desired results.",
            "That\u2019s why Ciampi is excited about this new research. It shows how a material that\u2019s not electrically conductive, such as tape, can create an electric field \u2014 and drive reactions without interfering with them. This, he says, could open \u201can entirely new space in chemistry.\u201d",

Small streams and creeks merge to form rivers. Rivers can merge to form bigger rivers. Eventually, the river empties into another body of water, such as a lake or ocean. The end of a river is called its mouth.",
            "Rivers have immense power to shape the lands they cross. Millions of years of erosion by water from the Colorado River, for instance, sculpted the Grand Canyon. Rivers can also suddenly split or reroute to form new landscapes. This quick change in path is known as avulsion. Where a river meets a lake or ocean, the water can dump sediment to form new land called a delta.",
            "Healthy rivers are important for many reasons. Rivers support aquatic life. That includes invertebrates, fish, plants and more \u2014 which can be found throughout a river, from the water\u2019s surface to its bottom, or bed. A river\u2019s water supports plants, animals and other life forms along its banks. People use river water to drink, water crops, transport goods and produce electricity through hydroelectric dams.",

            "Runoff from farmland carries pesticides and other pollutants into rivers. Medicines and other chemicals in our wastewater taint rivers as well. Human-caused climate change is warming river waters, stressing species that live there. Dams and groundwater pumping interrupt the flow of water through rivers, damaging their ecosystems. And sometimes people use so much river water that rivers dry up before reaching their mouth.",

Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",

Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",

As a mechanical engineer who studies how fluids affect movement, she couldn\u2019t help it. So she went right out, bought a balloon and wrapped it around the pickleball. It became the inspiration for a new surface to speed and steer aircrafts and underwater drones.",

Drag is the friction-like force that slows things down as they travel through a fluid. They\u2019ve also shown how changing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dimples can help steer an object through air, water or other fluids.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a cool idea,\u201d says Christopher Douglas at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Drag is a big challenge, he says. \u201cAnything you can do to minimize drag is great,\u201d says this mechanical engineer who did not work on the new skin.",

She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",

            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",

            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/De2VQYkdztM?feature=oembed",
            "Anchal Sareen and her team explain how they used soft robotic technology to develop dynamic surface dimples \u2014 ones that can change at different flow speeds \u2014 to cut the drag experienced by underwater vehicles. It should also allow them to maneuver without fins and rudders.",
            "They\u2019re also developing tests to see if the design would work in real-world conditions, such as the skin of some vessel sailing through air or water.",
            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",
            "\u201dA lot of people have asked me, \u2018Are you planning to patent this as a golf ball which can stay in the air?'\u201d Sareen laughs and says: Not any time soon."

Maybe you\u2019ve seen these pieces of ice laying on the ground after a storm. Their pummeling barrage starts and stops suddenly, seemingly without warning. This is a hailstorm. And it can be a truly impressive spectacle.",
            "Hail forms high in the clouds during a storm. There, some raindrops freeze solid. As more and more raindrops collide, an icy \u201cstone\u201d grows in size until it\u2019s too heavy to remain aloft.",
            "Particularly large or dense hailstones can damage human-made structures and objects, such as buildings and cars. Zach Lebo knows this firsthand. A meteorologist, he works at the University of Oklahoma in Norman. His parents in Pennsylvania had to replace their home\u2019s roof twice in the last 10 years due to hail damage.",
            "Researchers are hoping to better understand some of the mysteries of hail. One big question is how hail moves through the atmosphere and builds up in size. Some hailstones have measured more than 13 centimeters (5 inches) across. That\u2019s larger than a softball!",
            "fCHail comes in all sizes. It can be tiny bits of ice that melt almost immediately. Or it can be softball-sized chunks that persist for quite a while.",
            "Scientists used to think that hailstones grew by taking a looping path through the atmosphere. Think of their path as upward and downward like a merry-go-round tipped on its side. But such looping motions are actually rare, scientists in China have now shown. They analyzed hailstones collected by citizen scientists.",
            "Since 2016, people had been collecting hailstones across 15 provinces in China. These citizen scientists gathered more than 3,000 of these bits of ice and stored them until people on Qinghong Zhang\u2019s team could retrieve the hail. An atmospheric scientist, Zhang works at Peking University in Beijing. The best place for citizen scientists to store hail is, not surprisingly, a cold place, she says. \u201cThey put the hailstone in their freezer at home.\u201d",
            "Her group analyzed the chemistry of some of that hail. First, they sliced the stones, which allowed them to see layers of ice inside. The researchers then analyzed the specific isotopes of oxygen present in the frozen water within each layer. By matching that chemistry with the properties of the atmosphere at different heights, they could estimate the paths each ice ball had taken through the sky.",
            "Only 1 out of the 27 analyzed hailstones appeared to have moved like a tipped-over merry-go-ground. That was unexpected, says Zhang. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising.\u201d",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Studying the shapes of hailstones also can help reveal how each hailstone forms. Hail is seldom perfectly spherical, says Becky Adams-Selin. She\u2019s a hail scientist who lives in Omaha, Nebraska, and works at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, an environmental consulting company. Some hailstones sport lobes, she notes, and others can have lumps: \u201cYou can get all sorts of weird shapes.\u201d",

            "Over the spring and summer of 2025, Adams-Selin has been part of a team collecting hail samples from across the United States. The researchers have traveled across the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains and the Central Plains. This area includes Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas. And it\u2019s known for producing big storms that regularly spew hail. The project is called ICECHIP (short for In-Situ Collaborative Experiment for the Collection of Hail in the Plains).",
            "ICECHIP instruments measure things such as the air temperature, rainfall and the force with which hail strikes the ground. Adams-Selin also developed a device to store hailstones as the team drives around. \u201cIt\u2019s like a giant funnel that collects hail and funnels it into a battery-powered freezer,\u201d she explains, until they get back to the lab.",
            "Hailstones are a window into the atmosphere, says Liye Li. She\u2019s a meteorologist with the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. It can be hard to directly observe where hail forms, she explains. \u201cWe\u2019re blind to what\u2019s happening inside the clouds.\u201d But hailstones deliver clues about what\u2019s going on high in the sky right into scientists\u2019 hands.",

            "Many of us have eaten something that left us sick. \u201cNot only is it terrible in the moment, but it leads us to not eat those foods again,\u201d notes Christopher Zimmerman. He\u2019s a neuroscientist at Princeton University in New Jersey.",

            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The immune system is very complex. Much of what it does remains unknown. This study\u2019s analysis of what happened to the immune response is fairly simple, says Filip Swirski. \u201cA lot more should be done to look at this more thoroughly,\u201d he says. An immunologist in New York City, Swirski works at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.",
            "The European group is already working on this. They want to know how long the effects last after seeing a sick face. They also have begun monitoring more cells and molecules.",
            "The current study only focused on young adults. Whether the same thing happens in older people hasn\u2019t been tested. Age, sex and ethnic background may all affect how the body responds, Irwin points out. \u201cAll those factors need to be taken into account.\u201d",

            "Sleeping in on the weekends \u2014 as long as it\u2019s not for more than two hours \u2014 may improve mental health in teens.",
            "For many teens, Saturday mornings are a time to snooze. After a week of getting up early, the weekend brings a chance to catch up on much-needed slumber. And sleeping in on the weekend may reduce anxiety, a new study finds \u2014 as long as teens don\u2019t tack on more than two extra hours of shut-eye.",
            "It might seem like a good idea to get as much sleep as possible on the weekend. Sleep is essential for a fully functioning brain and body \u2014 especially for adolescents. And 75 percent of American teens don\u2019t get the recommended eight to 10 hours per night. School, homework and other weekday activities require them to rise early. Teens\u2019 circadian rhythm also makes it difficult to fall asleep before 11 p.m.",
            "Yet past research has hinted that too much sleep on the weekend can lead to health issues. Those studies had found a possible connection between catch-up sleep and depression. But the link hadn\u2019t been carefully studied. What\u2019s more, no one had looked at another major aspect of mental health \u2014 anxiety \u2014 in relation to sleep.",
            "That got Sojeong Kim curious. Kim is a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Oregon in Eugene. She set out to investigate how catch-up sleep might be related to anxiety.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Kim used data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. This study has \u00a0been following thousands of kids and teens from across the United States to learn how their brains develop over time.",
            "For her study, Kim focused on data collected from teens when they were 12 to 15 years old. That\u2019s around the age that people start having trouble getting enough sleep, she explains. It\u2019s \u201charder for teens to fall asleep early and wake up in the morning.\u201d",
            "The data included sleep and activity patterns for nearly 1,900 young people. These data came from a Fitbit each participant wore during the study. Participants had also filled out questionnaires about their feelings of anxiety and depression. Kim studied those, too.",
            "Teens who slept in on weekends reported the lowest symptoms of anxiety, but only if they got less than two hours of extra shut-eye. Teens who didn\u2019t sleep in \u2014 or lost sleep on the weekend \u2014 reported higher anxiety levels. Those who slept more than two additional hours had the highest anxiety symptoms of all.",
            "Anxious teens experienced neck tension \u2014 a common sign of stress. They also reported excessive worries, fears and guilt.",
            "Kim shared her findings at the SLEEP 2025 conference in Seattle, Wash., on June 11.",
            "\u201cThe results show a possible link between sleeping a little more on weekends and feeling less anxious,\u201d says Christopher Depner. \u201cBut we still need more research to know for sure.\u201d Depner, who was not involved in the work, studies sleep and circadian rhythms at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
            "One limit of the new research is that it was an observational study, Depner says. An observational study is one where researchers simply observe something happening in the world. They don\u2019t set up an experiment and control variables to test a hypothesis about how it works.",
            "\u201cThe scientists just watched how people sleep without asking them to try any new sleep habits or treatments,\u201d Depner points out. Having people follow different sleep schedules and then measuring their mental health could help clarify how one affects the other.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "If there is a link between just the right amount of catch-up sleep and anxiety \u2014 why? What would make someone who gets more than two hours of extra sleep more anxious?",
            "Kim suspects that having big swings between weekday and weekend sleep schedules creates what scientists call social jet lag.",
            "Like jet lag triggered by traveling between time zones, social jet lag causes grogginess and a foggy brain. It happens when our body\u2019s clock is out of sync with our sleep cycle. Switching from too little sleep to too much is a known trigger. Although Kim\u2019s study didn\u2019t investigate this as a cause, she suspects it\u2019s part of the problem.",
            "Kim didn\u2019t find a clear link between catch-up sleep and symptoms of depression. That might be due to the age group Kim studied. \u201cUsually, depressive symptoms onset later in adolescence,\u201d she says. Anxiety, on the other hand, tends to start when teens are younger. Kim\u2019s next step is to study weekend catch-up sleep among older teens.",
            "For now, she wants teens to know there can be benefits to catch-up sleep. \u201cGetting a little extra sleep on weekends might help [you] feel less anxious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not too much, because it can give you the opposite effect.\u201d"
