            "A vampire bat working out on a tiny treadmill helped scientists figure out the quirks of its metabolism.",
            "Vampire bats live on a strictly blood-based diet. So strict, in fact, that they seem to process their food more like some blood-feeding flies than like other known mammals.",
            "Researchers discovered this by coaxing common vampire bats\u00a0(Desmodus rotundus) to run on a tiny treadmill. Running isn\u2019t that unusual for these bats in the wild. When they\u2019re not flying around, they\u2019re often found scurrying along the ground after cattle, horses and other mammals to feed from.",
            "While bats in this experiment hit the mini gym, scientists tracked the carbon dioxide they exhaled. Up to 60 percent of that CO2\u00a0came from the bats metabolizing fuel other than carbs or fats. That was surprising, since those are the fuels that typically power running mammals.",
            "Instead, much of the energy bats were using came from a recent high-protein meal of cow blood. The gases they exhaled during their workouts contained telltale traces from amino acids. Those are the building blocks of proteins.",
            "Another clue to the fuel a runner is using is the ratio of CO2 exhaled to oxygen used. This ratio stayed steady as researchers pushed the treadmill pace from walking to running. That steadiness is a sign that bats weren\u2019t fueling their exercise the usual mammal way. Gas ratios typically change as exercise gets harder and mammals shift from burning mostly fats to relying more on carbs.",
            "Researchers shared these findings November 6 in\u00a0Biology Letters.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/rjBtx8AMR_Q?start=3&feature=oembed",
            "Researchers put vampire bats through their paces on a mini treadmill to discover what fuels their metabolism.",
            "The discovery means the vampire bats power along much like blood-feeding tsetse flies or some mosquitoes. That\u2019s a first for mammals, thinks Ken Welch. He\u2019s an ecological physiologist at the University of Toronto in Canada. He did the experiments along with Giulia Rossi. This physiologist now works at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada.",
            "The basic chemistry of bats\u2019 blood-based power isn\u2019t that unusual. \u201cIn most of us mammals,\u201d Welch says, we can break down amino acids for fuel or some other use. But those processes are \u201cbuilt to slowly churn along in the background.\u201d",
            "Hibernating bears, for instance, might use this fuel source. \u201cBut these are extreme examples,\u201d Welch says. And even then, bears \u201care\u00a0not\u00a0using amino acids they ingested in a meal only minutes before.\u201d \u00a0",
            "Vampire bats\u2019 blood diet seems fairly poor in the kinds of nutrients that let most mammals build up their stores of fuels such as fats. So it makes sense to Welch that bats\u2019 ability to use those fuels weakened over time.",
            "Yet relying so much on amino acids has its downsides. These fuels aren\u2019t as easy to access quickly. And that means the bats could be more vulnerable to starvation. These vampires get thirsty often."

            "Google is the first large tech company to openly watermark AI-generated material. And it made its SynthID code freely available for anyone to access. So other companies that run similar bots would be able to use this new tool.",
            "\u201cI am excited to see Google taking this step for the tech community,\u201d says Furong Huang. She\u2019s a computer scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park.",
            "Junfeng Yang also thinks it \u201cis really significant\u201d that Google\u2019s starting to use SynthID on all its bots. Yang is a computer scientist at Columbia University in New York City. Neither he nor Huang took part in developing this new watermark.",
            "Watermarking bot-made content is not a new idea, says Yang. Kohli and his team just came up with a cleverer way to do it. It involves a tournament. To understand it, you need to know a little about how a generative AI model works.",
            "Take a text-generating AI model like the one behind Google\u2019s Gemini. This type of workspace assistant studies lots of existing text to learn how likely certain words are to appear together. Then, it can write its own text in response to users\u2019 prompts.",
            "To generate that text, the AI model first looks at the words in a prompt. Let\u2019s say the prompt is: \u201cmy favorite tropical fruit is \u2026\u201d It then predicts what words are most likely to come next. A regular AI model would simply select a very likely next word, such as \u201cmango\u201d or \u201cbanana,\u201d and move on. Other words, like \u201cpapaya\u201d and \u201clychee,\u201d were possible too, but less likely.",
            "SynthID adds an additional step \u2014 the tournament \u2014 before selecting a word. This pits a bunch of possible next words against each other. The most likely next words get a bunch of spots in the tournament. In our example, \u201cmango\u201d and \u201cbanana\u201d would both show up lots of times. \u201cLychee\u201d and \u201cpapaya\u201d would only show up once or twice.",
            "During the tournament, pairs of words compete against each other over multiple rounds. Only the winners advance. It\u2019s just like March Madness in basketball. But here, a series of math calculations give each word its score. This score is based on a secret watermarking key. Perhaps the scoring makes \u201cmango\u201d beat \u201cbanana.\u201d This would give \u201cmango\u201d an edge among these two very likely words. The watermarking key might also give lychee a high score. But because mango shows up in the tournament more often, it\u2019s still more likely to emerge as the overall winner.",
            "So the tournament setup still favors the selection of very likely words. And that is important. Some other methods of watermarking make unusual words more likely to show up in responses. This can lead to mistakes or low-quality output.",
            "These tournaments happen over and over again, for every word in the generated text.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/9btDaOcfIMY?feature=oembed",
            "SynthID adds an invisible watermark to AI-generated images, video, audio or text. Google developed the tool and is adding it to content created with its AI models. \u201cSynthID is just one tool we are using to make sure generative AI tools are built with safety in mind,\u201d says a company video.",
            "Later, when someone wants to check text for a watermark, they just need a tool with the watermarking key. This tool does the math to find the scores for each word in the text. If the words in the text have fairly low scores, the text likely didn\u2019t go through this math-based tournament.",
            "If the words in a text have very high scores, though, that means these words would have won their tournaments. So the text was likely watermarked.",
            "In the above example, finding \u201cmango\u201d after \u201cmy favorite tropical fruit is \u2026\u201d would be evidence of a watermark. Finding \u201cbanana\u201d would not be, because this word\u2019s score was low. The longer the text is, the more words the watermarking key can score, and the more obvious the use of a watermark will be.",
            "Google\u2019s DeepMind team thought their tournament approach would lead to high-quality watermarked text. But to make sure, they ran some experiments.",
            "One happened live, as regular people were using Gemini. Their prompts got randomly routed through either the regular bot or one that added watermarks. This happened for 20 million interactions.",
            "Gemini users can rate the bot\u2019s responses with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down. The researchers found that the ratings did not differ in any significant way when watermarking was used.",
            "That was great news. But the researchers didn\u2019t stop there. They did one more experiment. They had a small group of people compare watermarked and non-watermarked responses side by side. These people \u201crated the quality across several categories,\u201d explains Yang. For instance, they rated how factual, helpful and grammatically correct the text was. Again, there was no significant difference in which they preferred.",
            "Detecting AI-generated content is important for many reasons. Teachers might want to know if students are trying to cheat using AI. Social-media sites might want to prevent AI-generated misinformation or spam from spreading.",
            "Gemini\u2019s watermark \u201cis not a complete solution\u201d to these problems, notes Yang. That\u2019s because testing for the watermark can only tell you whether the content had been created using one of Google\u2019s bots. \u201cThere will be other models that don\u2019t have watermarks,\u201d notes Yang. \u201cHow do you recognize them?\u201d",
            "Governments could pass laws to require watermarks on AI-generated content. But even then, \u201ctruly malicious people\u201d will find ways around this, says Yang. For example, they might find a way to remove watermarking code.",
            "Yang\u2019s team developed a tool called Raidar that can help detect AI-generated text, even when it hasn\u2019t been watermarked. But \u201cwatermarking enables much more reliable detection,\u201d says Huang. She is currently helping to run a competition called Erasing the Invisible. In this contest, teams compete to try removing watermarks from images. The goal is to discover which watermarks hold up best when people try to mess with them.",
            "Kohli and colleagues call SynthID \u201can important building block for developing more reliable AI-identification tools.\u201d"

The key to clearing a large loop is \u201cspeed, speed, speed,\u201d Segre says. \u201cThat\u2019s all that really matters \u2014 and some decent shoes.\u201d \u00a0",
            "As Sonic approaches the top of the loop, two downward forces act on him: gravity and the \u201cnormal force\u201d exerted by the track. Together, these forces create a centripetal force that keeps Sonic on his circular path through the loop. Sonic\u2019s inertia, which is his resistance to a change in motion, helps him maintain his high speed as he moves through the loop. That allows him to clear the top without falling off the track.\u00a0",
            "Like a roller-coaster car, Sonic needs to reach a minimum speed to do this. But that speed would barely be a light jog for such a fast hedgehog, says Segre. Sonic can sustain speeds of some 1,200 kilometers (760 miles) per hour. That\u2019s about the speed of sound. \u00a0",

            "Loops pop up in most Sonic the Hedgehog levels. But loops are rare in nature, says \u200b\u200bMostafa Hassanalian. At the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, Hassanalian designs robots inspired by animals. A lack of natural loops means most animals haven\u2019t evolved to run through these obstacles, he says. Instead, animals such as insects and geckos use specialized limbs to climb vertical surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Many insects run up surfaces using tiny claws and hairs on their legs that grip little pits and cracks. Geckos have thousands of tiny fibers under their feet that bond with a surface\u2019s molecules. Called van der Waals forces, these weak bonds are easily broken when the gecko lifts its foot.\u00a0\u00a0Sonic\u2019s hair may also help him clear loops \u2014 but not by gripping the track. Hedgehog quills are actually hardened, modified hairs. In the real world, these needle-like hairs protect hedgehogs from predators. Sonic\u2019s quills, though, may make him more aerodynamic, notes Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0Speedy animals such as cheetahs and horses need to reduce drag, or resistance to their motion caused by moving through air. An object\u2019s shape determines how much drag it experiences. Sonic\u2019s quills might reduce drag on his body by preventing large vortices, or whirls of air, from whipping up around him. The quills\u2019 jagged edges could cut these whirls into smaller vortices less likely to disturb airflow, says Hassanalian. \u00a0\u00a0He likens it to the vortex generators found on a race car. As a car speeds along, air passes along its surface. If this flow drifts away from the car, it can make the airflow turbulent, resulting in increased drag. Vortex generators are fins on a car that create small vortices, which redirect air back toward the car\u2019s surface. That helps stabilize the car at high speeds. \u00a0",

            "The physics behind race cars don\u2019t just apply to Sonic. Birds also take cues from racing to scale vertical surfaces. Most birds tackle tricky inclines using wing-assisted incline running, says Segre. \u200b\u200bWhen running up a slope, two-legged animals angle their bodies parallel to the surface. But this makes it hard to maintain the proper grip needed for climbing.\u00a0\u00a0So what can birds do? Flap their wings. \u201cThe wingbeats push them into the ground, kind of like the spoiler on a race car,\u201d says Segre. Like vortex generators, a spoiler is a device that affects how air flows over a vehicle. This disrupted airflow helps create a downward force that presses race cars into the ground, improving grip, or traction, between the tires and the road.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "\u201cOnce [birds] have that traction, they can actually use their legs to run,\u201d Segre says. This lets birds navigate different terrain, forage for food and escape predators. \u201cWe especially see it in baby birds who are not yet good at flying.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In experiments, this clever trick even let birds run up inverted walls \u2014 surfaces that slant toward the climber as they rise. No other two-legged animal manages this feat. \u201cWe see tons of climbing animals that are [four-legged],\u201d says Segre. This is because four-legged animals can \u201ckeep their body right up against the wall like a rock climber.\u201d By keeping their center of gravity close to the surface, they\u2019re less likely to tip over backward. Wing-assisted incline running helps birds hug similarly close to steep surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0Still, even wing-assisted birds aren\u2019t able to run upside down like Sonic. And their tactic for scaling inclines isn\u2019t what Segre would expect for our blue hero. While birds mostly use their legs to ascend, their wings are essential to getting enough traction. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really what Sonic does,\u201d says Segre. \u201cHe just uses pure speed.\u201d \u00a0",

Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!",

That\u2019s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth\u2019s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.",

Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth\u2019s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.",

Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.",
            "Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly \u2014 at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

Ice crystals lose electrons, leaving them positively charged. Wetter precipitation gains electrons, making it negatively charged. When the charges build up enough \u2014 ZAP! An electric spark,\u00a0or lightning,\u00a0jumps between the two regions to balance out the charge.",

            "fCIn a normal thunderstorm, lightning can reach down from clouds having a low base. Strong temperature differentials between the stormy area and the region in front of the storm, can cause air to rise quickly, creating lots of friction and charge separation.",
            "To get this in the wintertime, however, is challenging. In the summer, pockets of air rise vertically to produce thunderstorms. That doesn\u2019t really happen in the winter. Frigid-weather storms develop differently.",
            "Two conflicting forces wage a battle that sends air on a \u201cslantwise\u201d path high into the sky. That means the air isn\u2019t rising straight up and down, as in most thunderstorms. Thundersnow storms also do not usually form on the warm side of large, spiraling cyclones, as thunderstorms typically do. Instead, they develop in a weird spot \u2013 the colder backside of the storm system.",
            "Because large storm systems oftentimes look like commas, that aggressive backlash is called the \u201ccomma head.\u201d This is where cold air wraps in from the north.",
            "Snowstorms can become super windy. This will happen because the lowest air pressure will occur at the center of the storm. It mimics a vacuum, pulling in air from its surroundings. Air spirals into the middle of storm systems like water swirling down a drain.",
            "Or this is what usually happens.",
            "But the January 2018 storm threw a meteorological curveball. It brought with it an extremely strong temperature gradient. Over the ocean waters off of Cape Cod, Mass., air temperatures soared to near 13\u00b0 Celsius (55.4\u00b0 Fahrenheit). Just 330 kilometers (205 miles) to the west, over land in Connecticut, it was 18 degrees C (23 degrees F) colder.",
            "That extreme temperature contrast over such a narrow region generated a thermal wind. That\u2019s when air flows from warm to cold regions.",
            "Since cold air is denser; it sinks to the ground. Warm air from the ocean gets pulled in to replace it. That surface-hugging cold air undercuts the encroaching warm air. So the warm air now sloshes up that cold \u201csurface\u201d of air.",
            "That warm air goes on to climb into the atmosphere because it has so much momentum. It\u2019s like rolling a ball up a slide. Here, the slide is the surface of cold air. And the warm air is that ball rolling up that surface. Normally, the air wouldn\u2019t take this path. It\u2019s like bowling the ball up the slide, against the force of gravity.\u00a0",
            "It\u2019s also fairly uncommon, which makes it tough to forecast. It is much easier to predict the conditions that tend to be associated with it, such as narrow bands of heavy snow.",
            "Figuring out if, when and where lightning will strike within a snowstorm is a different story.",
            "The National Lightning Detection Network is a commercial array of antennas across the United States. It monitors lightning strikes 24/7, all year long. But this network\u2019s antennas will miss bolts that flash within clouds. That\u2019s why the National Weather Service relies on public reports of thunder or lightning to track most thundersnow.",
            "On rare occasions, as occurred earlier this winter, bolts may strike the ground. And when they do, these can be just as dangerous as strikes during a summer storm. They can cause damage, injury \u2014 even death. One bolt during a snowstorm on February 9, 2017, caused a house fire in Warwick, R.I. The bolt also zapped a nearby tree, blasting part of its trunk into the wall of that home,",
            "So what\u2019s going on? Two Japanese researchers had some insights 24 years ago that they described in the Journal of Geophysical Research. Their paper reviewed decades\u2019 worth of wintertime lightning strikes off the north coast of Japan. The pair used radar data and measurements from instruments used to measure electrical activity. From these data, clues emerged. It appeared that a key change takes place when low-topped winter thunderclouds mature.",
            "Think of the cloud as a three-layer cake, with each layer having a different electrical charge. For shallow, low-topped winter thunderclouds, the charges in these layers are positive-negative-positive. The lower positive charge can appear at temperatures from 0 to -9\u00b0 Celsius.",
            "And where the lower layer has a net positive electric charge, that layer \u201cis apparently capable of initiating ground flashes,\u201d the paper noted.",
            "So why did the 2018 New England storm clouds almost exclusively throw their lightning at tall towers?",
            "It\u2019s possible that these towers triggered the lightning by poking into the underside of clouds. In doing so, they take on this lower positive charge. They can now spark a bolt between the now-positive tower and the negative charge in the middle of the cloud above.",
            "But that alone shouldn\u2019t be enough to generate a bolt. After all, the electric fields in snowstorms are significantly smaller than those in summer thunderclouds.",
            "However, those fields can be locally enhanced by pointy objects. Those points can focus a charge, boosting it 10-fold. And that may be enough to exceed the level required for an electric charge \u2014 or spark \u2014 to leap\u00a0through the air. Once this happens, that spark can set off a rapid chain reaction.",
            "With that, a lightning bolt is born.",
            "But there\u2019s a catch. Nature resists charges leaping through the air. So when a charge builds up on some object, the air tends to create a local region around it that has the opposite electric charge. This is known as a \u201cspace charge.\u201d",
            "Consider the tower. If a positive charge were to build up on the tip, a negative space charge should form around it. This would shield the tower tip from being struck by a bolt from a region in the middle layer of the cloud .",
            "However, where the winds are strong enough, they can actually blow away this shielding space charge. That would leave the tower tip exposed, dramatically upping the odds of it triggering a lightning strike.",
            "This was observed in 2011 during the Chicago thundersnow storm of February 1 and 2. Researchers Tom Warner, Timothy Lang and Walter Lyons observed winds of 29 kilometers per hour (18 miles per hour) during each cloud-to-ground lightning flash. They noted a whopping 93 percent of lightning strikes in the snowy region of the storm involved tall buildings or towers (including wind turbines).",
            "During New England\u2019s January thundersnow events, the top of each tower where a lightning bolt was recorded had also\u00a0experienced high winds. Indeed, the minimum speed during every single flash exceeded 36 kilometers per hour (22.4 miles per hour). Moreover, the base of these storm clouds had been extremely low.",
            "The minimum height at which moisture will condense, forming a cloud, is known as the \u201clifting condensation level.\u201d In the case of the January storms, that level was around 275 meters (902 feet). And guess what: Each tower struck by lightning had been higher than that. So they would have poked into that lower positively charged region of the clouds.",
            "There was an exception, however. It was off the coast of Block Island, Rhode Island.",
            "At first glance, it looked like 10 or so bolts of lightning had randomly struck the water. Data would later show that five wind turbines were out there. The turbines\u2019 blades were mounted atop 30-meter (98.5-foot) pedestals. The turbines\u2019 shafts were each 100 meters (328 feet) tall. And each turbine blade was 73.5 meters (214 feet) long. Their total height, then, would exceed 200 meters (656 feet) when a blade tip was pointed up.",
            "That\u2019s still, however, 75 meters (246 feet) short of the seemingly minimum height needed to pierce the cloud bottoms. But that doesn\u2019t have to violate the rule because when clouds move over the ocean, they will encounter air with additional water vapor. And that will allow the minimum cloud-bottom height to fall somewhat. That means the blade tips indeed could have been immersed in the clouds\u2019 lower positive charge.",
            "Knowing this, can meteorologists forecast thundersnow in advance?",
            "It appears so.",
            "They can scan for conditions that would make possible such electrical light shows. For instance, something known as \u201cice crystal canting\u201d often precedes winter lightning strikes. This term refers to the orientation of snowflakes. Those flakes and other ice crystals normally fall flatly horizontal, like a pancake on a griddle. But as an electric field builds in the base of a cloud, it can tilt (or cant) ice crystals into a vertical (up and down) orientation.",
            "This shows up on radar as confused-looking banding. Knowing how to spot that radar signature could give forecasters a heads up to a field strong enough to produce thundersnow.",
            "Figuring out which towers are tall enough to scrape the cloud base also\u00a0 could pinpoint likely strike candidates.",
            "It\u2019s entirely possible that without skyscrapers and other super-tall human-constructed towers, most thundersnow simply wouldn\u2019t happen.",
            "Using such knowledge, it might be possible one day soon to calculate the risk in a storm that any given tall structure will be struck by winter lightning.",

Most come as individuals, although some can fall as multi-flake clumps. What all have in common is their source: clouds that usually hover at least a kilometer (0.6\u00a0mile) above the ground.",
            "*370_snowflake_collisionspng",
            "fC\nWhen snowflakes collide, their branches can tangle. This can create a compound flake. This often leads to whoppers (like those in first and third rows) by the time the flakes land.\n",
            "In winter, the air up there can be very cold \u2014 and will get chillier the higher you go. To form snowflakes, those clouds need to be below freezing. But not too cold. Snowflakes form from the moisture in a cloud. If the air gets too cold, a cloud won\u2019t hold enough water for anything to precipitate out. So there has to be a balance. That\u2019s why most flakes develop at or just below freezing \u2014 0\u00ba Celsius (32\u00ba Fahrenheit). Snow can form in cooler environments, but the colder it gets, the less moisture will be available to make a snowflake.",
            "In fact, a cloud\u2019s air has to be supersaturated with moisture for a flake to form. That means there is more water in the air than would normally be possible. (The relative humidity can reach 101 percent during supersaturation. That means there is 1 percent more water in the air than it should be able to hold.)",
            "When there is too much liquid water in the air, a cloud will try to rid itself of the excess. Some of that excess can flash freeze into crystals, which then lazily meander to the ground.",
            "Or that\u2019s the simple answer. The details aren\u2019t quite that straightforward.",
            "One more thing is needed to turn cloud moisture into a flake. Scientists call it a nucleus (NOO-klee-uhs). Without something to glom onto, water droplets can\u2019t freeze. Even when the air temperature is well below freezing, water droplets will remain liquid \u2014 at least until they have a solid object onto which they can attach.",
            "Usually, that will be something like a pollen grain, dust particle or some other airborne bit. It could be smoglike aerosols or the volatile organic compounds released by plants. Even tiny soot particles or microscopic metal bits spewed in a car\u2019s exhaust could become the nuclei around which snowflakes crystalize.",
            "Indeed, when the air is very clean, it can be very difficult for a cloud\u2019s moisture to find a nucleus.",
            "Near the ground, any object can prove a suitable freeze-onto zone. That\u2019s how we get rime ice to form on the branches of trees, light poles or vehicles. Different from frost, rime ice develops when supercooled water droplets freeze onto subfreezing surfaces. (In contrast, frost forms when moisture collects on surfaces in liquid form, and then freezes.)\u00a0",
            "High in a cloud, there have to be some tiny floating particles for snow crystals to develop. When the right conditions do emerge, supercooled drops of water will latch onto these nuclei (NOO-klee-eye). They do it one by one, building an ice crystal.",

            "The oxygen\u2019s nucleus is larger, so it has more pull. It yanks more strongly at the negatively charged electrons that they share. This brings those electrons a little closer. It also gives the oxygen a relative negative electric charge. The two hydrogen atoms end up a tad positive, in terms of charge.",
            "Alone, the structure of a water molecule resembles a wide V. But when multiple H2O molecules find themselves close to one another, they begin to pivot so that their electrical charges pair up. Opposite charges attract. So a negative hydrogen aims itself towards a positive oxygen. The shape that tends to result: a hexagon.",
            "That\u2019s why snowflakes have six sides. It stems from the hexagonal \u2014 six-sided \u2014 structure of most ice crystals. And hexagons team up. They link with other hexagons, growing outward.",
            "That\u2019s how a snowflake is born.",
            "Each hexagon contains a lot of empty space. This explains why ice floats on water;\u00a0it\u2019s less dense. Warmer H2O molecules in the liquid phase are too energetic to settle into a rigid hexagon. As a result, the same number of H2O molecules occupy 9 percent more space as solid ice than they do as liquid water.",

In January 1887, a Montana rancher reported snowflakes \u201clarger than milkpans.\u201d That would make them some 38 centimeters (15 inches) across. As that was back before portable home cameras, this number can be challenged. But snowflakes larger than 15.2 centimeters (6 inches) do sometimes develop. Biggies tend to form when temps are near freezing and the air humid. A snowflake\u2019s size also reflects other factors. These include wind speed and direction, dew point \u2014 even how electrified different layers of the atmosphere are. But nobody has ever really conducted measurements when gigantic flakes were flying.3. Most snowflakes fall at roughly a walking pace \u2014 between 1.6 and 6.4 kilometers (1 and 4 miles) per hour.",
            "4.\u00a0With the cloud in which flakes form usually one to two kilometers (0.6\u00a0to 1.2 miles) up, each crystalline wonder may drift anywhere from 10 minutes to more than an hour before reaching the ground.

            "A female ringed caecilian is shown with her babies. This species feeds its babies a fat-rich fluid. Made in the reproductive tract, this fluid is similar to mammals' milk.",
            "In a humid coastal rainforest, a litter of pink, hairless babies snuggle with their mom. They stir and squeak for milk and drink from their mother until they are full. But these are no puppies or cubs. They are snake-shaped amphibians, far closer to frogs than to foxes.",
            "Mammals are named for their ability to produce milk. But scientists have found that a few species that are not mammals feed their young this way, too. These include certain spiders, fishes, cockroaches and birds \u2014 and now, snake-shaped amphibians. Ringed caecilians (Siphonops annulatus) are the first amphibians known to feed hatchlings a kind of \u201cmilk.\u201d Researchers reported their new finding March 8 in Science.",
            "Caecilians (Seh-SEEL-yenz) have many strange features. Rarely seen, they are burrowing creatures that are nearly blind. Some species, like the ringed caecilian, have poisonous slime and may be venomous. They feed their own skin to their young.",
            "Herpetologist Carlos Jared of the Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, has been studying these animals for years. After hatching, ringed caecilian babies live with their mothers for two months. Jared and his research team found that the babies spent much of their time around the end of their mom\u2019s body. That\u2019s where there\u2019s an opening called a vent. It\u2019s shared by mom\u2019s reproductive, digestive and urinary systems.",

            "Feedings started with the babies wriggling and nibbling at their mother\u2019s vent. They also made high-pitched noises. Mom would then raise that end of her body and release the fluid. This happened up to six times per day. It looked like the mothers were responding to the babies\u2019 pleas.\u00a0",
            "The squeaking and begging is a fascinating observation, says Mark Wilkinson. He\u2019s an evolutionary biologist in England at the London Natural History Museum. Adult ringed caecilians are thought to be sensitive only to lower pitched sounds, he says. So it\u2019s surprising that moms seem to respond to high-pitched noises from their young.",

            "This \u201cmilk\u201d is rich in fats, much as mammal milk is. This nutritious resource may help explain how the hatchlings grow so fast. They more than double their mass in the first week of life. Their only other nourishment is their mother\u2019s skin, which they feed on once every few days.",
            "Isabella Capellini wonders if the squiggly siblings compete for milk access. She studies evolution at Queen\u2019s University Belfast in Northern Ireland. Capellini is also curious about how the \u201cmilk\u201d production affects the mother.",

            "It\u2019s not known how these amphibians evolved their version of milk. But a clue may come from other caecilian species that give birth to live young. Their oviducts sometimes feed their babies a milky substance while in the womb. These species, however, do not feed their babies after they\u2019re born.",

            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",
            "Compost has everything the plastic needs to degrade: microbes to break it down plus water. The material also can break down in wet soil or the ocean.",
            "But the new plastic won\u2019t break down while you\u2019re using it, says Stephen Mayfield. He\u2019s a molecular geneticist at UCSD. He\u2019s also the chief executive officer of Algenesis Materials. To break down the microplastics, \u201cyou need them to be wet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you break that cycle, even for a short period of time, you kill the microorganisms.\u201d",

            "When microbes break down plant materials, such as cellulose, they release carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. The researchers decided to compare the CO2 output of microbes dining on the new microplastic to when they ate cellulose.",
            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",
            "The scientists also coated a piece of fabric in the new plastic. After being mixed with the compost for two weeks, that fabric easily broke apart. Another piece of the coated fabric was not composted. It was still intact after two weeks.",
            "\u201cI\u2019m so excited for this in the textiles space,\u201d says Lisa Erdle. She\u2019s an ecotoxicologist at 5 Gyres. It\u2019s a nonprofit institute in Santa Monica, Calif. Erdle did not take part in the new work, but she does study how microplastics affect the environment.",
            "Polyurethane is sometimes used to coat natural fibers, like wool and cotton, for clothing, Erdle says. Over time, that plastic coating flakes off, \u201cfragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces and never going away.\u201d Having something that can readily be broken down by bacteria, she says, is better than \u201chaving persistent plastic in the environment.\u201d",

            "Moving forward, Algenesis Materials hopes to start making biodegradable, single-use plastics, says Mayfield. These might, for example, replace materials currently used in food packaging, he says. And then \u201cyou just chuck that thing in a compost pile and it becomes mulch in about 90 days.\u201d",
            "\u201cWhat I want is for people to have hope that there are solutions\u201d to the microplastics problem, says Burkart. \u201cWe actually don\u2019t have to accept the status quo.\u201d"

            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",
            "Carbon capture technologies receive some criticism. Some people argue that the benefit of this tech is too small to be of value. Or that carbon capture can disguise the real problem \u2014 that people should not be burning so many fossil fuels in the first place. Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

If you measure the properties of one particle, you automatically know the properties of the other. And whatever happens to one will also affect the other.",

            "Dandruff is a type of dermatitis (Der-muh-TY-tis), or skin inflammation. One study estimated that half of us will at some point develop this condition. And one key time it may emerge is puberty.",
            "Everyone\u2019s scalp hosts a mix of microbes. This is known as its microbiome (MY-kroh-BY-ohm). Sometimes the normal proportion of some types to others gets messed up. This is known as a dysbiosis (Dis-by-OH-sis). In people with dandruff, certain types of yeast and bacteria are far more common, compared to people with healthy scalps.",
            "Amy McMichael\u00a0and others discussed some of the culprits in a July 2024 report in the Archives of Dermatological Research. She\u2019s a dermatologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. Both are in Winston-Salem, N.C.",
            "People often make the mistake of thinking an itchy, scaly scalp is dry, McMichael says. If they add oil, though, they risk making matters worse. Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",
            "Hair-care practices might explain some of the difference, McMichael says. She and others have found differences in how often women of African and European ancestry shampoo their hair. Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",
            "And also use hair conditioners, McMichael advises. \u201cIt actually smooths the outer layer \u2014 the cuticle \u2014 much better than you can get with oil.\u201d Be careful about using hair sprays and gels, she adds. These can dry hair, increasing the risk that strands will break.",
            "In any case, if you notice a hair or scalp problem, talk to your doctor or another health-care expert right away. You might need help for dandruff. Or you might have a more serious skin or hair condition.",
            "\u201cThe earlier that you come in, the better off you are,\u201d McMichael says."

            "*a_model_of_a_uman_heart_behind_illustrated_ECG_traces",
            "The heart beats steadily from long before you\u2019re born to the day you die. Triggering each beat (illustrated in background by an electrocardiogram line) is a zap of electricity \u2014 literally the pulse of life. ",
            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GMBSU-2GK3E?feature=oembed",
            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",
            "*an_animation_showing_the_electrical_signal_that_travels_through_the_various_parts_of_the_heart_to_ca",
            "fCKalumet/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)",
            "This animation shows the electrical signal, or action potential, coming from the heart\u2019s right sino-atrial node (at animation\u2019s top left). That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."
