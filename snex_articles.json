            "The thunderous roar of the MGM lion has opened Hollywood films for nearly a century. That iconic sound has conditioned us to hear the big cat\u2019s call in a specific way. It\u2019s a booming blast that announces power and presence. But the real soundscape of a lion pride is far more intricate than what you hear at the movies, new research shows. And this finding challenges decades-old assumptions about lions.",
            "Scientists used machine-learning techniques to analyze field recordings of lions in Africa. \u00a0",
            "They found that African lions (Panthera leo) produce two distinct roars. There\u2019s the familiar, guttural one that anchors a roaring bout. It carries vocal signatures that are unique to each animal. But they also found an overlooked \u201cintermediary\u201d roar. It\u2019s shorter and lower-pitched than the classic full-throated type.",
            "Biologists long have known that a lion\u2019s roar helps advertise territory. It also attracts mates and helps pride members locate each other. A complete roaring bout begins with moans and ends with grunts. But scientists had treated everything in the middle as a single roar.",
            "The new data let biologists separate that roar into its parts. And it might help train artificial intelligence (AI) to tell the voice of one lion from the next. That could let conservation groups count and track lions by sound alone.",

            "\u201cThe new work makes the technique easier to understand and implement by non-specialists,\u201d Karen McComb says. She did not take part in the new study. But her work at the University of Sussex in England focuses on how lions and other animals talk to each other and how they think.",
            "As lion habitat has been shrinking and more people have been killing these big cats, they\u2019ve declined by 90 percent through their historic range, says Jonathan Growcott. Being able to identify a lion by its roar could allow you to count them. A conservation technologist and large-carnivore biologist, Growcott works at the University of Exeter in England.",

            "Growcott\u2019s team ran more than 3,000 calls through a computer program. It was designed to detect patterns in the sound signals. And subtle differences jumped out.",
            "Full-throated roars traced a clear arc. They rose in pitch before ending in a trailing fall. Intermediary roars were flatter and far less elaborate.",
            "The researchers used the length and pitch of a sound to build an algorithm. It\u2019s a type of computer tool built around step-by-step rules for doing something, such as analyzing data. This algorithm classified each type of roar, moan and grunt with high precision. In at least one lion population, its accuracy topped 91 percent.",
            "Roar types and the more informative full-throated call helped the tool identify which lion was roaring. The tool even outperformed human experts.",
            "A lioness goes through her repertoire of roars as she walks a dirt road in the Bubye Valley Conservancy of Zimbabwe. You can hear the newly identified \u201cintermediary\u201d roar in the middle of her vocalizations. It\u2019s in between her starting moans, a full-throated sound and her final grunts.",
            "fCMatt Wijers",
            "Tanya Berger-Wolf is a computational ecologist. She works at Ohio State University in Columbus. This is one of the first clear demonstrations that machine learning can reliably interpret the vocalizations of a mammal, she says.",
            "The recordings, however, lack context on what a lion had been doing at the time. So scientists still can\u2019t say why lions choose one roar type over the other.",
            "This is an open question that intrigues lion experts like Craig Packer. He works at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul. \u201cIt would be interesting to have enough recordings in known contexts to know if lions roar more loudly in certain situations,\u201d he says.",
            "As for the MGM lion, his iconic roar contains no hidden intermediary roar. That\u2019s because the sound doesn\u2019t belong to a lion at all. In a bit of Hollywood movie magic, sound designers opted for something even more ferocious, Growcott says. \u201cThe MGM lion is actually a tiger.\u201d"

Dubbed \u201cSplatatouille\u201d \u2014 a riff on the name of the Disney movie Ratatouille \u2014 the Chicago Rat Hole went viral in 2024. Now research suggests that imprint is likely a squirrel squish.",
            "The decades-old imprint became a sensation when artist Winslow Dumaine posted about the site.",

            "There don\u2019t appear to be footprints leading to the imprint. So Granatosky suggests the animal likely fell into the wet concrete from above. Perhaps a bird of prey in flight \u2014 such as a hawk or owl \u2014 dropped the rodent. Or it may have fallen from a tree that residents say once stood by the mystery mammal mark.",
            "Rat purists note that there\u2019s no squirrel-like bushy tail in the impression. But Granatosky says it\u2019s not likely that concrete would capture such fine furry detail.",

Yet the researchers still can\u2019t be 100 percent sure what species made the beloved landmark. This shows just how hard it can be to analyze ancient specimens such as fossils. Granatosky hopes this case study will spark public curiosity.",

            "At the time, Takebe\u2019s dad had to be hooked up to a ventilator. This involved snaking a tube down his throat so that a machine could push air into his lungs. \u201cI was really shocked by how invasive it is,\u201d says Takebe, who works at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center in Ohio. He also works at the University of Osaka in Japan.",
            "Takebe worried about how the ventilator might affect his dad. Doctors had already removed part of his dad\u2019s left lung due to a past infection. Takebe also was concerned about his father\u2019s lack of other options if the ventilator didn\u2019t get him enough oxygen. That got the scientist curious: Was there any way to get oxygen into the body without using the lungs?",
            "Inspiration struck when a student brought a book into Takebe\u2019s lab. The book described how some animals get oxygen through their skin or guts. Freshwater fish called loaches offer one example. They can swallow air and absorb oxygen through their intestines. It\u2019s a trick that helps them survive when their gills can\u2019t pull enough oxygen from the water.",
            "Takebe is an expert in the branch of medicine that deals with the digestive system. So he knew that the human intestinal tract is rich in blood vessels. That\u2019s why treatments called enemas \u2014 which send liquid up a patient\u2019s bottom \u2014 can get medicine into the bloodstream. And it made Takebe suspect that oxygen could pass from the intestines into the bloodstream, too.",
            "Takebe\u2019s team devised an enemalike treatment. It sends a liquid called perfluorodecalin (Per-floor-oh-DEK-uh-lin) up the rectum. This liquid can be loaded up with lots of oxygen. As it releases that oxygen into the body, space opens up within the liquid\u2019s chemical structure. The liquid can then absorb \u201cexhaled\u201d carbon dioxide.",
            "The scientists first tested this in mice and pigs. The super-oxygen-rich liquid did\u00a0help the animals survive low-oxygen conditions. Pigs got 400-milliliter doses. (That\u2019s slightly more liquid than a 12-ounce can of soda.) Each dose boosted pigs\u2019 oxygen levels for about 19 minutes.",
            "Takebe\u2019s team published those findings in\u00a02021. Later pig tests\u00a0showed the technique could improve animals\u2019 oxygen levels for up to half an hour.",
            "During these experiments, Takebe vividly recalls seeing samples of the pigs\u2019 blood change color. It shifted from a muddy, low-oxygen hue to a brighter, oxygen-rich red. \u201cThat was my aha moment,\u201d he says. It\u2019s when he realized this wild idea might actually work.",
            "In 2024, the research won an Ig Nobel Prize \u2014 a cheeky award for science that makes people laugh, then think. \u201cThank you so much for believing in the potential of [the] anus,\u201d Takebe said at the awards ceremony.",

The liquid wasn\u2019t loaded with oxygen as it would be for a real treatment. The scientists just wanted to see if people could hold this liquid in their guts without it harming them.",
            "Volunteers got different amounts of the liquid. The smallest dose was a squirt of 25 milliliters (about 5 teaspoons). The biggest dose was a whopping 1.5 liters (about 1.5 quarts). That\u2019s the most currently allowed for other medical procedures that send liquid up the bum.",

            "And even if people can get oxygen through the intestines, that wouldn\u2019t make it practical, Laffey adds. \u201cA liter of perfluorodecalin carries 500 milliliters of oxygen,\u201d he says. \u201cWe use 250 milliliters per minute. \u2026 It\u2019s just very hard to see how this would work.\u201d At the very least, sustained oxygen support would require a lot of enemas, over and over.",
            "Kevin Gibbs is more intrigued by the treatment. He\u2019s a critical-care lung doctor at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "\u201cIt definitely raised my eyebrows,\u201d Gibbs says of the butt-breathing idea. \u201cAs someone who treats a lot of people who have low oxygen levels, I tend to think of myself as an above-the-waist doctor.\u201d But sending oxygen in the back entrance \u2014 if it\u2019s shown to work \u2014 could be useful in a few cases, he thinks.",
            "One example is when doctors need to put a tube down someone\u2019s throat to hook them up to a ventilator. The process takes mere minutes. Yet in that time, patients can suffer dangerously low oxygen levels, Gibbs points out. If sending oxygen up the anus works, it might sustain patients for the short time it takes to get them on life support. \u201cThat would be huge,\u201d he says.",
            "Takebe also imagines intestinal oxygen as an add-on to other types of breathing support. It could also be a short-term solution when other treatments aren\u2019t available. \u201cMaybe we can apply this in emergency situations,\u201d he says. For instance, when someone is on the way to the hospital. Or when they\u2019re being transferred from one hospital to another. But that future would still be many years and clinical trials away.",
            "In the meantime, how does Takebe\u2019s father feel about butt breathing as a way to help patients like him? \u201cDad is pleased,\u201d Takebe says. \u201cHe\u2019s always offering to be our experimental subject.\u201d That would of course be a conflict of interest, Takebe adds.

            "Why?",
            "At its heart, schadenfreude is built on conflicting emotions, suggests one brain study. In 2009, researchers in Japan used functional MRI (fMRI) to study the brains of young adults as they read about some made-up person. Such fMRI imaging can identify parts of the brain that are active during a task.",
            "When the fictitious person performed better than them at something or had higher social status, participants reported feeling envious. And their brains showed activity in a region tied to pain, both physical and emotional. It\u2019s called the anterior cingulate (SING-gyew-let) cortex. Their envy caused these people emotional pain, the results suggest.",
            "When the fictitious person later suffered some misfortune, another brain area got busy. Called the ventral striatum (Stry-AY-tum), it helps process rewards. After the brain scan ended, these participants reported feeling schadenfreude. The stronger their envy, the stronger the schadenfreude. That emotion appeared to help soothe that pain caused by their envy, the researchers concluded.",
            "\u201cEven if schadenfreude might seem like a guilty emotion, it actually plays an important role,\u201d Cecconi concludes. \u201cIt helps us understand ourselves and our relationships with others.\u201d",
            "Young kids most often experience justice schadenfreude. But as they grow into teens, the emotion shifts into the other types. That\u2019s the finding of a 2025 study in Psicothema.",
            "\u201cAdolescents display a more complex morality\u201d than children, says Antonio Cabrera-V\u00e1zquez, the study\u2019s lead author. He\u2019s a graduate student in educational psychology at the University of C\u00f3rdoba in Spain. When teens assess the actions of others, they\u2019re not just focused on whether a misfortune is deserved. They\u2019re \u201calso influenced by interpersonal factors,\u201d he says. \u201cSuch as liking or disliking others.\u201d",

            "What\u2019s the connection? People who enjoy others\u2019 misfortunes tend to also show other behaviors.

            "Forgiveness plays an important role in preventing that slide into dangerous waters, Toussaint says. But he wants to be clear: Forgiveness isn\u2019t the same as accepting or excusing bad behavior.",

            "At a minimum, the goal is to treat the person who harmed you in a neutral way. Sometimes forgiveness can help us patch up relationships. But when that doesn\u2019t happen, letting go of your hatred still helps you return to a happier, healthier state.",
            "And happiness matters, Toussaint points out. It helps us flourish, like a plant that gets plenty of sun and water. When we flourish, we can live life to the fullest. That\u2019s especially important for young people who are figuring out what their lives might look like. Letting go of past hurts can restore happiness to someone who had been focused on payback.",
            "Forgiving isn\u2019t easy. It takes practice and a firm decision to stick with it. \u201cThe absolute best thing you can do is stay committed to it,\u201d Toussaint says. Think of it as a skill, like learning to throw a curveball or land a tricky jump. The more you work on it, the more likely you are to succeed. For those who struggle with this, there are resources that can help you get started. Toussaint recommends Forgiveness Foundation and Discover Forgiveness.",
            "Knowing schadenfreude comes to us so naturally, there may be ways to harness it for good, says Yael Zemack-Rugar.

They shared this finding in the April 2025 Journal of Consumer Psychology.",
            "Let\u2019s say your school is having an event to raise money. The study suggests that including a dunk tank or pie-throwing event might bring in more funds. But how much it raises depends on who is sitting over the water or getting a face full of pie. If a teacher, principal or coach is the target, more students will pay to take part.",

            "\u201cThese people normally have power over us,\u201d Zemack-Rugar says. \u201cThat makes it feel exciting and funny when we get to be in charge in a harmless way.\u201d Giving your teacher a face full of whipped cream helps level the playing field, at least for the moment. Same goes for soaking the principal over and over again. \u201cPeople will enjoy knocking them down a peg,\u201d she says.",
            "So the next time you\u2019re at a school carnival, get in line for the dunk tank or pie throw. We all enjoy knocking someone off their pedestal now and again. However, Zemack-Rugar adds, \u201cthis only works if they don\u2019t experience any real harm.\u201d"

That wall-like appearance is one thing that sets a haboob apart from other types of sandstorms. (A sandstorm is a broad term for windy storms that blow around sand and dust.)",
            "Haboobs are common in dry places, such as the U.S. Southwest and the Sahara. They move fast and can extend for kilometers (miles). Their wind speeds vary. But they can reach speeds of more than 95 kilometers (60 miles) per hour! These storms may last only a few minutes. Or they may persist for hours.",
            "Another thing that sets haboobs apart from other sandstorms is the way they form. Haboobs usually arise from thunderstorm downdrafts. A downdraft is when a thunderstorm quickly pushes air toward the ground in the area around the storm. This downward rush of air spreads out when it hits the ground, creating strong winds. In dry, dusty regions, those winds can pick up dust and sand. This creates a huge, moving cloud of sand and dust that can reach thousands of meters (feet) into the air.",
            "When a haboob sweeps through, it can kick up so much sand and dust that it\u2019s hard to see through the grit. That makes driving very dangerous. Drivers are advised to pull over and turn off their lights to avoid confusing others on the road in the poor visibility conditions. Winds can also blow sand into a person\u2019s mouth, making it hard to breathe. As a haboob approaches, the safest thing to do is get inside and close all windows and doors.",

            "Cosmologist Katie Mack studies dark matter, an invisible substance that researchers suspect holds the universe together. Teasing out the identity of this elusive matter can help researchers better understand the universe\u2019s beginnings and its possible end.",
            "Before Katie Mack became a scientist, she was the kid taking apart TV remotes and building solar-powered cars out of LEGOs. \u201cI\u2019d take things apart and put them back together to figure out how they work,\u201d she says. This tinkering kick-started her love of science.\u00a0\u00a0But Mack wouldn\u2019t come across her future career until she was about 10 years old. That was when she read A Brief History of Time by physicist Stephen Hawking. His explanations about black holes and the Big Bang inspired Mack to figure out how the universe works. When she found out Hawking was a cosmologist, she says, \u201cI became convinced that I wanted to be one, too.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Now a cosmologist herself, Mack studies invisible material known as dark matter at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, in Canada. While dark matter doesn\u2019t absorb or emit light, it can affect objects with its gravity. \u201cSo we have this idea that dark matter is out there, but we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s made of,\u201d she says. But researchers suspect it helps hold the universe together.\u00a0",
            "Sleuthing out dark matter\u2019s true identity can help answer larger questions about the universe, says Mack. These include better insights into how galaxies form and evolve over time. In this interview, Mack shares her experiences with\u202fScience News Explores. (This interview has been edited for content and readability.)\u00a0",
            "When I was younger, my mom was working toward her Ph.D. in nursing. She trained as a nurse and worked in hospitals but also did clinical research around treating cancer. I learned a lot from her about how science and research work.\u00a0",
            "Also, my grandfather was a meteorologist in the Navy. He served on the Apollo 11 mission. His job was to make sure that the location of the splashdown after the mission would be safe. It turns out that there was a big storm at the original site planned for the splashdown. So they moved the site because of that. When you\u2019re coming down on the parachutes, it\u2019s important not to have a storm.\u00a0",
            "Sometimes, I\u2019d see scientists on TV. Whenever there was an earthquake, one of our local seismologists, Kate Hutton from Caltech, would talk about it. It was inspiring to see a scientist talking to reporters about how the world works. Having that personal connection with scientists is very valuable. It helps the public better understand how science works and how we know what we know. ",
            "*Katie_Mack_sits_in_the_pilot's_seat_of_yellow_airplane_She_is_wearing_a_green_jacket_and_a_headset_",
            "fCIn her free time during the pandemic, Mack earned her pilot certificate to fly airplanes.",
            "One of the biggest things that I encounter when I talk about dark matter is people saying that it\u2019s not real. They assume it\u2019s just a mistake somewhere in the math or that scientists need to rethink gravity. People often bring this up as though we haven\u2019t thought about that. They assume scientists just had a cool idea and ran with it. That\u2019s not really how it goes.\u00a0",
            "When trying to come up with an explanation for some phenomenon, scientists compare different possible models at every stage. We really try our best to come up with all possible ways of thinking about the problem. If we reject one, it\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t fit the data.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, I think physicists are very often more creative than people realize. We\u2019re not just grinding through math. People sometimes suggest that we\u2019re set in our ways. That we\u2019re not trying out new ideas. But nobody\u2019s going to get the Nobel Prize for that. The findings that make a big splash are not the ones saying that everyone was right in the first place.\u00a0",
            "I would give myself a little encouragement and tell myself that it\u2019s OK if what I\u2019m doing is really hard. That doesn\u2019t mean that I wasn\u2019t cut out for it.\u202f\u00a0",
            "A lot of people get really discouraged as soon as they find that they\u2019re having trouble in a field. They assume that it should come easily if it is going to be their career. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily true. It\u2019s OK to not be born good at something. You can learn and develop your skills. Just because something is much harder for you than your classmates doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t do it.\u202f\u00a0",
            "I think so many kids get the idea that all scientists are these super geniuses. That you can tell someone is a scientist just by how they look or talk. In the media, you can tell which one is a scientist because they have a certain look, attitude or way of speaking. A lot of kids can\u2019t relate to that. It convinces them that they can\u2019t be scientists. That really does people a disservice. The scientific community is much more diverse than that.\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "One of the big challenges in my field is just sticking with it. In physics, more people want to do academic research than there are jobs. If you\u2019re applying for a postdoctoral fellowship, oftentimes there will be 300 people applying for one position. That makes it quite hard to progress. \u00a0\u00a0And when you get to faculty jobs at colleges and universities, it\u2019s even worse. Most people who get Ph.D.s in physics do not end up with faculty positions. That means sticking with it may not always be the best option. Figuring out how to pivot to something else if your plans don\u2019t work out becomes really important, yet difficult to make happen.\u00a0\u00a0Faculty jobs also require a lot of relocating to different institutions or even countries. I\u2019ve had to move to a new country at every stage of my career since I started graduate school. On one hand, it\u2019s a privilege that I\u2019ve been able to live, say, in Australia for five years and England for three years. But it can also be really challenging in other ways. Starting all over again in a new place can be really lonely. Making all of those sacrifices can make it difficult to stay motivated and engaged.\u00a0",

He was struggling to hit the ball far and straight with his driver. (That\u2019s the club used for that first long shot down the green.) So Brady set out to see whether tweaking the way he tees up his ball would improve his drives. And it did.",

            "What he learned earned him a finalist spot at the 2025\u00a0Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge. There, Brady won the first-place engineering award. (The program is run by Society for Science, which also publishes\u00a0Science News Explores.)",
            "An aspiring engineer, Brady did this project as an eighth grader at Saint Thomas More Middle School in Rapid City, S.D. First, he built a machine that could hit a golf ball the same way over and over. To do this, he altered a clay-pigeon thrower \u2014 a device that launches targets for hunting practice.",
            "Brady\u2019s modified device swung the clubhead of a driver to hit a golf ball. He had it hit balls off tees of different heights above the ground \u2014 from 1.5 to 3 centimeters (0.6 to 1.2 inches). He also had it hit balls off tees that were positioned slightly forward or backward, relative to the club. And to make a golf ball soar, he found, a high tee placed farther backward generally worked best \u2014 unless there was wind.",
            "Hitting a ball into the wind was a different challenge. Now, placing a tee lower and farther forward worked better. Why? It kept the ball low, so the wind didn\u2019t mess with its trajectory as much.",
            "Here, Brady shares his research experiences and insights.",
            "\u201cComing up with a way to hit the golf balls consistently,\u201d Brady says. \u201cWe as human beings are not perfect, and whenever I try to hit the golf ball it goes different.\u201d",
            "The idea for his machine came while he was visiting his grandparents\u2019 farm and found one of his grandfather\u2019s clay-pigeon throwers. \u201cTo rig the device, it took around a month,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to tinker with it a lot, because at first it couldn\u2019t get the ball off the ground.\u201d",
            "\u201cThat I was able to take all of my data and use this information on the course myself,\u201d Brady says. \u201cBefore this project, I was struggling with my driver all year. That was my worst club. And it seems that this kind of clicked, because now I love the driver.\u201d",
            "\u201cMy clay-pigeon thrower has a tiny spring,\u201d Brady says. So it couldn\u2019t hit golf balls that far. \u201cIf I could somehow make the spring larger \u2014 like use a garage-door spring or something \u2014 then I could see larger differences in my data.\u201d Comparing bigger differences between longer hits could lead to more detailed insights into how tee position affects driving success.",

And it can withstand the pressure of ink being pushed through it.",
            "At first, the plan was to use the proboscis as the nozzle for an existing 3-D printer. But pushing ink through the narrow tip might need more pressure than those printers could handle, says Cao.\u00a0So his group designed a printer around the mosquito\u2019s mouthpart. They coated the proboscis with resin to make it extra stable.",

            "Fantastic Four\u2019s Invisible Woman can vanish with ease. No real humans can pull off this feat \u2014 but some animals come close.",
            "In The Incredibles, Violet Parr is a lot like other teenagers. She has embarrassing parents, a troublesome little brother and a crush so intense it makes her want to disappear. But unlike other teens, Violet can turn invisible. So she can actually vanish when the boy she likes looks her way.\u00a0",
            "Characters with invisibility powers \u2014 like Violet, the Fantastic Four\u2019s Invisible Woman and H.G. Wells\u2019 Invisible Man \u2014 can do all sorts of cool things. Escape embarrassing situations. Snoop on other people. Get into places where they\u2019re not allowed. It\u2019s no wonder why invisibility is one of the powers kids most wish for. Many animals, too, find it helpful to hide in plain sight. And though it\u2019s out of reach for people, some animals are nearly transparent.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Being invisible is useful for animals that spend a lot of time in places with no good hiding spots, like the air or open ocean, says Kate Feller. She studies vision and behavior at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The secret to invisibility is all about light. \u201cThe way we see things is when light is reflected back off of an object onto our eyes,\u201d says Feller. The more light that can pass through something undisturbed, the harder it is to see that thing.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Light can\u2019t easily pass through most animals, Feller says. Light that hits our bodies usually gets absorbed or bounced around. But animals with nearly invisible body parts have figured out tricks to get around this.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "A lot of animals get their colors from molecules called pigments. These compounds appear different colors depending on which wavelengths of light they absorb and which they reflect. Green pigments, for instance, reflect green light and absorb all other colors. Human hair and skin get color from the pigment melanin. For an animal to vanish in plain sight, it needs to get rid of these colorful compounds.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Most baby fish lack pigments. This helps them hide from predators when they are too small to swim fast. They typically develop pigments as they grow up. Yet some species stay see-through their whole lives. One is the ghost catfish (Kryptopterus vitreolus). Its head has pigments, but its body is almost fully transparent. Seen from far away, it looks like a floating head!\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Some body parts are hard to hide. Eyes need pigments that absorb light so an animal can see. And even clear stomachs will show up if animals eat colorful food. Ghost catfish eat only small bits of food and \u201chide\u201d their meals in a long, thin, tube-shaped stomach, says Qibin Zhao. This physicist and material scientist studies ghost catfish at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.\u00a0",
            "Blood can\u2019t be transparent, either. The molecules that carry oxygen have colored compounds. (The one in our blood, hemoglobin, makes it red.) So up close, the ghost catfish\u2019s vessels are still visible.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Glass frogs have a clever way around this. When these mostly clear frogs sleep, they cram almost 90 percent of their blood cells into their liver. This makes their belly skin two to three times more transparent than it would otherwise be. Scientists think the frogs do this so that predators don\u2019t snack on them while they nap.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "*On_the_left,_an_amphipod_floats_in_the_black_depths_of_the_deep_sea_On_the_right,_three_ghost_catfis",
            "fCAmphipod crustaceans (left) and ghost catfish (right) boast see-through body parts.",
            "Even pigment-free objects are not entirely invisible. Light travels at different speeds through different materials. As a result, light zipping through one material will bend or bounce when it hits another material. Light bouncing off an animal makes it shine, just like the sun reflecting off a puddle.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Some animals\u2019 see-through parts are nearly reflection-free. Glasswing butterflies, for instance, have wings that are almost fully transparent. Their wings have fewer reflective scales than other butterflies\u2019 wings. The wings are also covered in tiny wax bumps. These bumps soften light\u2019s transition from air to tissue, allowing it to pass through the wing mostly undisturbed.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Tiny amphipod crustaceans do a similar thing, says Feller. These animals are so transparent you could read text right through their bodies. Their shells are covered with little round bacteria. These may create a smoother path for light, like the wax bumps on glasswing butterflies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Even when light makes its way inside the body, an animal isn\u2019t necessarily in the clear. Each cell in the body is full of many components that bend light as it passes through. Light then scatters around the body, making things look foggy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The more tissue that light needs to pass through, the foggier things get, says Zhao. That\u2019s why most invisible animals are pretty thin.

            "We all know ice is slippery, but the physical reason for this has remained a mystery for the past 200 years. ",
            "Slippery ice is something most of us have encountered, whether it\u2019s been under our boots, car tires or skates. But why ice is so slick has puzzled scientists for centuries. Now researchers in Germany offer a new explanation. They show ice can melt slightly with no heat added. It\u2019s due to molecular-level changes that disrupt the crystal structure of ice.\u00a0",
            "For hundreds of years, people have tried to understand why ice is slippery. In the 1850s, Michael Faraday performed a now-famous experiment. This chemist and physicist showed that if you placed two ice cubes atop one another, eventually they\u2019d lock together. Each had been coated in a thin layer of water, he explained. And that water froze when the cubes touched.",
            "This didn\u2019t show, however, why ice was covered in that thin layer of water.",
            "A few years later, an engineer named James Thomson offered an explanation. Pressure, like heat, can melt ice. Using math, he showed that the pressure from a boot, say, or skate blade could melt a small amount of the ice. That could form the thin layer of water.",
            "But there was a problem with this explanation.",
            "The pressure from a boot wouldn\u2019t melt enough water for the ice to turn slippery. You\u2019d need to concentrate all of someone\u2019s weight on a very small area to do that. How small? About the size of a poppy seed.",
            "Almost a century later, in 1939, a pair of physical chemists came up with another idea. Pressure and heat together could melt ice to create a slippery layer of water, they suggested. This heat could develop from the friction of a boot or other object\u00a0traveling over the ice.",
            "But even this explanation fell short. Why? Ice remains slippery even at sub-freezing temps. And so the slick mystery persisted.",
            "In 2024, researchers at Peking University in Beijing, China, explained why some of the water layer forms. Tiny defects in the surface of ice, they found, can create a thin layer of water on top of it. In fact, notes Martin M\u00fcser, that team showed that \u201ceven at an extremely cold temperature, there is some initial water on the surface.\u201d However, M\u00fcser argues, that water layer is not thick enough to make ice truly slippery.",
            "M\u00fcser\u2019s team at Saarland University in Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany, now offers a different, but related, explanation. To figure it out, these materials scientists modeled what happens to ice at the molecular level.",

Then they watched how properties of its molecules would change when the model had a sheet of ice touch another surface (such as a boot, tire or skate).",
            "Water is a dipole molecule. That means one side has a slight negative electric charge; the other side is positively charged. That charge separation makes the molecules in ice line up in a regular structure \u2014 like little magnets.",
            "*a_molecular_structure_of_crystalline_ice",
            "fCThe crystal structure of ice is made up of a lattice of highly ordered water molecules, each with two hydrogen atoms (white) bonded to an oxygen atom (red). ",
            "Yet it doesn\u2019t take much to disrupt that ordered structure. Imagine a boot touching the ice. Dipoles within the boot itself will attract dipoles in the top layers of the ice. It\u2019s like two magnets attracting one another.",
            "As the boot moves, the dipoles in the ice move, too. Now the perfect crystal structure of ice begins to fall apart as more and more of its molecules step out of line.",
            "This process is called frustration, says M\u00fcser. The ice \u201ckind of melts without really heating.\u201d",
            "The molecular changes shown by the new simulations would be virtually impossible to physically observe, the researchers note.",
            "M\u00fcser likens crystalline ice to \u201can ordered bed of shell pasta.\u201d Imagine, he says, what would happen if \u201cnow you rub over it with a slightly sticky hand.\u201d Some shells will get pulled out of order. The dipoles in the boot or tire provide a similar stickiness to pull ice molecules out of order.",
            "The affected molecules no longer behave like a crystal. Instead, they become that thin layer of water atop the ice.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "This is not the traditional way ice melts. It usually melts due to pressure or heat. But in this case, solid ice changes into liquid water as defects mess up its crystal structure.",
            "\u201cThis means ice can be slippery even at low temperatures,\u201d says Lars Pastewka. He\u2019s a microsystems engineer at the University of Freiburg in Germany. Indeed, the Saarland computer model shows that \u201cfrustrated\u201d ice will remain slippery at 10 kelvins. That\u2019s \u2013442\u00ba Fahrenheit, or close to absolute zero.",
            "\u201cMolecular simulations like these have the power to show what every atom is doing,\u201d says Robert Carpick. That \u201cis why [this new model\u2019s] results should be taken seriously.\u201d A mechanical engineer, Carpick works at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.",
            "Pastewka\u2019s group has shown similar crystal defects in silicon and diamond. This can turn their surfaces slippery, too. Diamond has one critical difference, though. With water ice, \u201cthe harder you push, the easier it gets to turn it into a liquid-like goo,\u201d Pastewka says. In diamond, you get the opposite effect \u2014 which actually protects the surface.",
            "In theory, you could skate on diamond for the same reason you can on water ice. But you wouldn\u2019t leave as many marks on the surface of a diamond rink.",
            "So what\u2019s the solution to keep you from slipping on ice in winter? \u201cI would say, put on cleats,\u201d says M\u00fcser. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only way.\u201d",

            "Our solar system is peppered with large rocks, called asteroids. If a big asteroid plummets to Earth, there are many possible outcomes. The space rock could splash into the ocean and not harm anyone, for instance. Or it could wipe out a city. People have a hard time understanding the chances of an asteroid strike. So a team calculated the likelihood and compared it with other events \u2014 with some surprising results.",
            "\u201cIf a large or a medium asteroid were to hit the Earth, it would be something that almost everybody on the planet would be aware of,\u201d says Carrie Nugent. She\u2019s a planetary scientist at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Mass. While killer asteroids have hit before, such as the one that finished off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago, Nugent says not to worry. \u201cWe try to put this event, which is actually a preventable event, in context with other preventable events.\u201d",
            "Nugent worked with six undergraduate students from Aalborg University in Denmark. Using a computer program, they simulated a group of asteroids similar to real near-Earth objects. They fed these modeled asteroids into a program called JPL Horizons. Anyone can use that program to look up predicted locations for objects in the solar system. For this project, the students determined whether each simulated asteroid would cross paths with Earth.",
            "That allowed the team to estimate the frequency of asteroids bigger than 140 meters (460 feet) across. That\u2019s around the size of a small cruise ship, Nugent says. An asteroid of this size would hit Earth roughly every 11,000 years. The researchers shared their findings August 12 in the Planetary Science Journal.",
            "That number is still pretty hard to understand. So Nugent compared the chances of an asteroid hitting Earth with other events that people may experience. The chances of being alive during an asteroid strike, she found, are higher than that of being struck by lightning. But a person is more likely to die in a car crash.",
            "Some events were rare but deadly. People \u2014 kids in particular \u2014 can die in dry sand hole collapses. This can happen when someone digs a large hole in sand, often at the beach. That hole can fall in on itself and take its digger down with it. \u201cIt is an extremely rare cause of death that most people don\u2019t even know about,\u201d Nugent says.",
            "Books and movies often portray asteroid run-ins as unstoppable events. \u201cThe truth is actually entirely the opposite,\u201d she says. NASA\u2019s DART Mission in 2022, for instance, bopped an asteroid that wasn\u2019t in danger of hitting Earth. The test changed the asteroid\u2019s path. This showed that people might be able to do this one day with a rock headed for our planet and avert a collision. So, Nugent says, it\u2019s important to do research, such as sky surveys, that locate these objects. \u201cThis is the one natural disaster we can totally prevent,\u201d she says.",
            "Nugent\u2019s team calculated the chances of near-Earth object (NEO), such as asteroids, hitting Earth in a person\u2019s lifetime. They compared this with the likelihood of other preventable events. The chance of an asteroid hitting the Earth is shown by the blue marker. The chance of such an asteroid killing a person is shown by the vertical blue bar.",
            "The graph is presented on a logarithmic scale. That means each grid line differs by a factor of ten from the one next to it. The x-axis gives the one-in-X chance that an event happens to an individual or the planet. For instance, the chance of being hit by lightning is 1-in-11,000. The y-axis gives the one-in-Y chance that a person dies if the event happens. So someone hit by lightning has a 1-in-10 chance of dying.",
            "Unlike most graphs, the label numbers on the x-axis get smaller moving to the right. And on the y-axis, they get smaller going up. This is because a one-in-X number is like a fraction with \u201c1\u201d on top and the \u201cX\u201d number on the bottom.

            "Polar bears often swim to find seals at sea or on ice floes. As the Arctic has been warming, the ice has been melting, too. This gives bears fewer rest stops to catch their meals, dine and rest. Earlier work by Pilfold\u2019s team showed that the bears often have to swim exhaustingly long distances between meals. They tracked one female who swam 400 kilometers (249 miles) nonstop over a period of nine days.",

            "Snowboarders, skiers and other athletes are gearing up to compete in the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Scientific advances may give some competitors an edge, but climate change threatens the very future of these games.  ",
            "In just a few days, athletes from around the world will compete in the Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. The Olympic games are a spectacle of speed and grace. Curlers deftly nudge stones into place. Figure skaters whip themselves into fancy twirls on the balance of a blade. Snowboarders ride rails and launch off of ramps into daring flips and twists. Every Olympian has trained for years to show off their skills on the world stage.",
            "In contests between such elite athletes, tiny details can make the difference between silver and gold. The chemistry of ski wax, for instance, affects how well skis glide across or grip snow. The recipe can make or break a skier\u2019s performance. In bobsledding, meanwhile, shoe stiffness is key. Just the right amount of bendiness can give athletes the boost of speed they need to take first place.",
            "But there\u2019s one key piece of Winter Olympic equipment no one can totally control: cold weather. Without it, athletes like skiers and snowboarders can\u2019t compete. Unfortunately, many cities may soon be too warm to host the Winter Olympics. The reason: human-caused climate change. If it doesn\u2019t get cold enough, snow can\u2019t fall. In fact, this is the first Winter Olympics ever that will completely depend on artificial, rather than natural, snow. That could become the norm in the future.",
            "Some technology does exist to coax clouds into making more snow. This weather-control technology helped create clear skies at the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008. But tampering with the weather may have unintended consequences. And it still won\u2019t produce enough snow to keep the slopes covered.",

            "The bobsled teams competing at this year\u2019s Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, are hoping to start on the right foot. And that begins with the right shoes. So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that footwear scientists in South Korea have been hard at work building a better bobsled shoe for their home team.",
            "Bobsledding is one of the fastest winter sports. Only 0.001 second can make the difference between bringing home a silver medal or gold. That\u2019s in a race that only takes 60 seconds. And the most important part of that race takes place in just the first six seconds.",
            "In bobsled, one, two or four athletes race down a track in an enclosed sled, propelled just by gravity. Most of a team\u2019s success depends on what it does before the clock even begins. That\u2019s during the first 15 meters (49 feet) of the \u201cpush start\u201d \u2014 when they push the sled across the icy track, just before jumping in. Shortening the time by just 0.01 second could shorten the finishing time by 0.03 second, recent studies have shown. That\u2019s more than enough to make the difference between a gold medal and disappointment.",
            "\u201cThirty to 40 percent of the race outcome is decided by the push start,\u201d says Alex Harrison. He would know. Harrison used to be a bobsled racer (and probably would have gone to the 2018 Winter Olympics if he hadn\u2019t hurt his foot last fall). He also studied the bobsled push start as a graduate student at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. Now, as a sports physiologist, he studies how physical activity affects the body.",
            "Being fast helps with the push start, but it\u2019s not enough. Bobsled athletes also have to be strong, especially in the legs, Harrison notes. Large tissue fibers known as fast twitch muscles help with short, powerful bursts of movement. That\u2019s why sprinters make for good bobsledders. Their muscles are already primed for these fast starts.",
            "The athletes need to keep their knees and feet low to the ground during the push start. This ensures they don\u2019t waste time and energy bringing the foot back around. Instead, their foot \u2014 and their shoes \u2014 spend more time pushing against the ice.",
            "And that\u2019s why a bobsledder\u2019s shoes are incredibly important. Similar to track cleats, these shoes have spikes on the soles. But instead of six or eight large spikes, they have at least 250 small ones. Those spikes help grip the ice, giving the athlete more traction to propel themselves forward.",
            "Nearly every bobsled team member wears the same brand of shoes. They\u2019re from Adidas, the only company that makes them for the sport. But those shoes may not be best for everyone, Harrison points out, since not every person is shaped the same.",
            "Seungbum Park works at the Footwear Industrial Promotion Center in Busan, South Korea. His work focuses on the interplay between a bobsledders foot and shoe. It is very important and would pave the way to developing bobsled shoes that are better for South Korea\u2019s national team.",
            "Park\u2019s group started by filming bobsledders. High-speed cameras focused on the feet as athletes ran wearing various shoes. Each shoe had reflective markers attached to the front and middle. This let the researchers see how the front of the foot bent in different shoes.",
            "That bend is key.",
            "As running speed increases, the foot bends more. This provides the driving force and spring that propels the athlete forward. If shoes don\u2019t allow the foot to bend enough, they can limit the foot\u2019s motion and limit an athlete\u2019s performance.",
            "But the researchers found that shoes that were the most flexible weren\u2019t the best. Ones with soles that had harder middle and outer layers helped the athletes run faster. The team published its initial findings in 2016.",
            "\u201cA stiffer shoe will transfer force better to the ground,\u201d Harrison notes. In most people, the big muscles in the legs will overpower the little muscles of the feet. But a stiffer sole allows the foot to become artificially stronger, allowing a faster start. The foot needs to bend, but it also needs to be strong.",
            "Soles aren\u2019t the only important part of a shoe. Some shoes, including bobsled shoes, point slightly upward at the toes. This is known as the \u201ctoe spring angle.\u201d",
            "After their first study, the Korean group went back to the bobsledders. This time, they tested them in shoes having three different toe angles: 30, 35 and 40 degrees. Shoes with the greatest toe-spring angle \u2014 40 degrees \u2014 led to the best performances, they showed. These shoes gave bobsledders the best bend to their feet, driving them forward and shortening their start time. The scientists shared their new findings in September 2017 Korean Journal of Sport Biomechanics.",
            "Harrison says a good bobsled shoe needs to be stiff, but also to bend enough to allow athletes to lean the shins and body forward and down during the first 10 meters (33 feet). \u201cIt looks like [the Koreans] accomplished that in a big way,\u201d he says.",
            "This shoe research could improve start times for the Korean bobsledders by 6 to 10 hundredths of a second. \u201cThat can certainly be the difference in making the medals or not,\u201d Harrison says."

A wetter snow, for instance, will require a different wax than\u00a0\u00a0dry\u00a0fluff. And downhill racers get\u00a0a different recipe than\u00a0cross-country skiers.",
            "Chemicals in the wax help skis glide downhill. The wax does this by repelling water that forms as a ski slides across the snow. Cross-country skiers, in contrast, must go both uphill and downhill. Their ski wax, therefore, must help the athlete also grip the snow while climbing short hills during a race.",
            "One type of wax makes skis slippery. Another makes it grip. A racer who uses the wrong formula risks lagging behind. This also can happen if the snow\u2019s properties change during a race. Maybe it gets colder. Or starts snowing. It may even rain. Such weather changes can alter the surface of the snow in ways that can make it harder on racers.",

            "Randall attributes some wins that brought her to the Olympics to the waxes she used. It allowed her to glide faster than other racers on the downhill part of the course. The recipe she and others use is critical. Racers get only one chance to wax their skis before a race begins.",
            "Long before a race, various waxes will be tested. Then, technicians and racers pick a mix that they think will best match the snow on race day. They rub and melt layers of the chemicals onto the bottom of each ski. Then they scrape and polish each layer to make it super-smooth. Sometimes they add a sticky wax called \u201cklister\u201d \u2014 or kick wax \u2014 to the part of the ski below the boot. This helps racers grip if and when they need to climb.",

They cut friction between the ski and the surface of the snow. (These chemicals are related to additives that manufacturers sometimes use to make rain gear repel water.)",
            "Fluorocarbon waxes are softer than some other types. They may be used as fluids or as powders. For a two-minute downhill race, skiers want the slipperiest surface possible. They will need a different formula for a two-hour-long, cross-country event. Indeed, cross-country racers may apply six or more layers of wax to give a competitor control in moving up and down across a course.",
            "Some fluorocarbon ski waxes also have extra hydrocarbons, such as acetone (ASS-eh-toan), benzene or toluene (TAAL-yu-een). These chemicals can be harmful if a person touches or inhales them a lot or over long periods. Yet they must be used repeatedly. After all, most of these chemicals will rub off a ski by the end of a race.",

And that attachment is so strong it can last for months.",

            "The researchers potted up dozens of these plants. Then they dropped each Mimosa 60 times in a row. The plants weren\u2019t harmed by the drop. It was short, with a soft landing. And they curled their leaves \u2014 but only the first few times. Pretty quickly, they stopped reacting.",

            "They also could detect isoprene (EYE-so-preen). It\u2019s a natural hydrocarbon released by trees, especially oaks. By itself, isoprene is not toxic. But in the presence of sunlight, it can mix with nitrogen oxides to cook up ozone (O3), which is toxic to our lungs.",

Plus, heat speeds up the chemical reactions that produce ozone.",

Stay indoors when temperatures and ozone levels are highest, typically from noon to 4 p.m., says Zhang. Air-conditioned buildings (with windows closed) are best. Their cooling equipment contains filters that typically remove some pollutants.",
            "If outdoors, stay as far away from busy roadways (and traffic pollution) as possible.

            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change?

(It has the potential to fall off the shelf, turning the energy stored in its height into kinetic energy.) Even sitting on the ground, a book\u2019s pages have energy; they can fuel a fire. Our sun radiates energy in the form of heat and light. Sound from your phone\u2019s speaker moves in waves of energy.",
            "Just as you can save money in a bank for later, energy can be stored, too. Batteries store chemical energy, as does food. Your body stores energy in fat cells for later use.",
            "So energy is all around you \u2014 in motion, in heat, in sound, in light, stored in food and fuel. But here\u2019s the puzzle: When a rolling ball stops or a battery \u201cdies,\u201d where does all that energy go?",
            "Energy doesn\u2019t go anywhere. It just transforms.",

            "A ball falls from a height. While the ball is up high, it has potential energy due to its position. But as gravity pulls it down, that potential energy converts into the energy of motion.",
            "When the ball slams onto the pavement, its kinetic energy splits up. Some turns into the sound energy you hear as a sharp thwack. Some gets absorbed by the ground as heat. But the ball doesn\u2019t immediately come to a stop. Some of its kinetic energy remains, bouncing it back upward. It rises, but not as high as before \u2014 because it no longer has the energy that was transformed into sound and heat. With less energy, the bounce cannot push the ball as far upward.",
            "The ball falls and bounces again. Each time it hits the ground, more of its energy converts into sound and heat. Eventually, all of its initial potential energy will have morphed into heat and sound. This allows the ball to roll to a stop.",
            "In each step, energy is transformed from one type to another \u2014 spreading through the ground as heat and the air as sound waves.",
            "That physical law on the conservation of energy holds that energy can change forms. It just can never be created or destroyed.",
            "\u201cConservation of energy is so important to science because it is the one thing that is always true in the world as we experience it,\u201d Freeman says. \u201cIt applies equally to an elephant and to an ant.\u201d",
            "And it shows up everywhere. Consider fusion reactions, which power the sun and other stars. Here, two atoms combine to form a larger atom, releasing energy in the process.",

            "Fusion can sustain a star\u2019s steady emission of light and heat for billions of years. This is why fusion energy interests scientists so much. If it could be controlled on Earth, small amounts of fuel could power entire cities.",
            "A lot of the confusion surrounding energy comes from how we all use it in everyday language. We\u2019ve all learned to use the term in a very non-scientific way.

            "A \u201cdead\u201d battery no longer works because its stored chemical energy has been converted to heat and electricity. That electricity powered your phone. Similarly, when we say power plants \u201cgenerate\u201d energy, it\u2019s not being created out of nowhere. Instead, power plants convert energy from a solid \u2014 usually a fossil fuel (such as coal) or uranium (a radioactive element) \u2014 into heat and light. That heat then drives a turbine, which transforms mechanical energy into a flow of electrons: electricity.",

            "We use the term renewable energy to refer to energy sources that effectively won\u2019t run out (at least in humanity\u2019s lifetime). That makes solar, wind, geothermal and hydropower essentially unlimited resources.",

            "A chemical formed from onion juice (propanethial S-oxide) triggers those tears. Slicing the onion ruptures its cells, triggering a chemical reaction that forms this compound. Chopping can fling tiny droplets of it into the air. If they bind to sensory nerves in a cook\u2019s eyes, they\u2019ll cause that well-known stinging \u2014 and tears.\u00a0",
            "But slicing onions slowly with a sharpened knife cuts the number of tear-inducing droplets that were spewed. This technique could offer serious relief to everyday cooks. It also could shed light on how pathogens spread.",

            "\u201cThis is something everybody\u2019s dealing with,\u201d says physicist Navid Hooshanginejad. He now works at SharkNinja, a product-design company in Needham, Mass. \u201cNow we can also explain and understand it better fundamentally.\u201d",

            "Onions were the focus of Hooshanginejad\u2019s research at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. He sliced up onions for a salad, one day, while brainstorming about his project with his advisor. Drops from the juicy onions landed on his hand. He thought, \u201cWhat if these drops flew high enough to make me cry?\u201d",
            "The next day, he lugged a 10-pound (4.5-kilogram) bag of onions to the lab. Then he set up a high-speed camera, grabbed a knife and started slicing.",
            "He and his coworkers wanted to find out what about the cutting action matters most in determining how far onion-juice droplets fly. So they built a miniature guillotine, which allowed them to insert blades of varying sharpness. Then they attached sensors to measure the force and speed of each cut. The high-speed camera captured the spray of flying droplets emitted with each slice of a blade.",
            "Fluid-containing cells sit in each layer of an onion\u2019s skin. Every pass of the knife slices open these cells. Released juices then pool and press against the onion\u2019s skin. This pressure causes the juices to fly once the blade breaks through that skin.",
            "A blunt blade requires more force to break an onion\u2019s skin than a sharp one. That extra force squashes a greater number of cells, releasing more fluid. And it makes a difference: Rapid cuts made with dull knives can shoot onion droplets nearly 40 meters (130 feet) high, they found. That\u2019s almost half the height of a giant sequoia!",

It may extend their survival time in the snow, a new field trial shows. That could increase the chance of a successful rescue.",
            "The trial took place at a field site in northern Italy. There, participants were buried face down under 50 centimeters \u2014 about a foot and a half \u2014 of snow. The goal was to remain there safely for 35 minutes. No one in the group that was wearing the new safety device needed to be removed early due to low blood oxygen levels. Researchers reported the finding in the November 18 Journal of the American Medical Association.",
            "Minutes after being buried in an avalanche, someone\u2019s blood level of oxygen will begin to drop. At the same time, carbon dioxide level in the blood will climb. The chance the person will survive starts to drop after 10 minutes. Around two-thirds of people whose head and chest are trapped under snow will die of insufficient oxygen within 35 minutes.",
            "The new trial tested a safety device that\u2019s integrated into a backpack. It weighs a little over 500 grams, about 1.1 pounds. Called Safeback SBX, it runs on batteries that power a fan. That fan draws air from the surrounding snow, then directs it to the buried person\u2019s face from outlets in the backpack\u2019s shoulder straps.",
            "In the trial, researchers monitored participants\u2019 oxygen levels, heart and breathing rates and other health measures throughout the burial. The experiment ended if anyone\u2019s blood oxygen level got dangerously low \u2014 below 80 percent. This did not happen for the 12 people in the safety device group. Eleven remained buried for the full 35 minutes. One asked to be removed early due to unexpected skin irritation.",
            "In contrast, seven of the 12 using a fake device had to stop early because they fell below the blood-oxygen cutoff. Another four requested an early end. Three felt short of breath. One had a panic attack. Most people in the fake-device group remained buried between five and 13 minutes. Only one person in that group stayed under the snow for the full 35 minutes.",
            "Avalanches kill an average of 100 people in Europe each year, including skiers and mountain climbers. Avalanche deaths in the last several years in the United States have ranged from roughly one dozen to several dozen."
