            "Sundew plants with\u00a0Acrodontium crateriforme\u00a0fungi living on them can digest insect prey much faster than sundews with fungus-free leaves.",
            "Insects already have plenty to beware when it comes to carnivorous plants. But now, they can add an acid-loving fungus to the list.",
            "The fungus works with a type of meat-eating plant called a sundew. The plants\u2019 tentacle-like leaves\u00a0trap insects in a sticky goo, or mucilage (MEW-sih-lahge). Once stuck, their prey suffocate in that goo or die from exhaustion. As they do, the sundew produces enzymes that dissolve the insects into nutrients that it will absorb through its leaves.",
            "But plant enzymes aren\u2019t the whole story. A fungus called\u00a0Acrodontium crateriforme\u00a0offers a\u00a0helping hand in digestion.\u00a0It\u00a0produces digestive enzymes, too. These make a sundew\u2019s leaf environment more acidic. That helps both plant and fungal enzymes in the mucilage work faster.",
            "\u201cThis creates a synergistic effect,\u201d says Isheng Jason Tsai. By that, he means that the combined effect is greater than the sum of each set of enzymes working by itself. As a result, the insect meal breaks down faster so the plant gets more nutrients. Tsai is an evolutionary biologist at Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan. He was part of a team that shared its new findings in the October Nature Microbiology.",
            "Past studies had hinted that other meat-eating plants have live-in bacteria to help with their digestion. Pitcher plants have such microbes, for instance. Bladderworts do, too.",
            "Finding that a certain microbe can help with digestion \u201creshapes our understanding\u201d of meat-eating plants, Tsai says.",

            "fCPutting a helpful fungus on sundew plants cut the time it took sundews to break down their insect meal from 92 hours to 73 hours.",
            "Tsai\u2019s group hunted for microbes living on spoon-leaved sundews (Drosera spatulata). This species lives in temperate and tropical regions, including Taiwan. The scientists found a wide array of bacteria and fungi on the plants.\u00a0A. crateriforme\u00a0topped the list as the most common. Its DNA made up an average 40 percent of the microbial genetic material in leaf mucilage.",
            "Tsai\u2019s team then sprinkled powdered ants on sundews to mimic the plants catching prey.\u00a0Plants without A. crateriforme took an average of 92 hours to digest the powder. Those with the fungus took only 73 hours, on average.\u00a0",
            "A. crateriforme grows on other\u00a0sundew species, too. One species lives in both the United Kingdom and United States. A. crateriforme has also been found on purple pitcher plants.",
            "The fact that\u00a0A. crateriforme\u00a0dwells on sundew plants across three continents is notable, Tsai says. It suggests there\u2019s an ancient relationship between these two life forms. Finding the fungus on other meat-eating plants is key, too. It hints that \u201cthe relationship is a more widespread evolutionary strategy in botanical carnivory.\u201d",

            "The firefly species that suffers this fate is Abscondita terminalis. It lives in tropical parts of Asia. Males have two lanterns. Females have just one. A single flash from a female usually helps male fireflies find her among tall grasses at dusk. Males are showier, giving off multiple light pulses to attract a mate.",
            "But if stuck in the web of an orb weaver spider, flashy males can become deadly decoys. By making male fireflies blink in a pattern more like females, the spider now lures other firefly males into its web.",

            "Fireflies trapped in the webs of the orb weavers changed their flashes. Those in the webs of other spiders did not, explains Daiqin Li. He\u2019s an ecologist at Hubei University who worked on the study.",
            "When an orb weaver spider was around, male fireflies also were likely to get caught in its web and to change their flashing pattern. This was less likely when the spider was absent. These findings hint that something about the spiders affected the trapped fireflies\u2019 flashes.",
            "Further observations suggests that the fireflies\u2019 altered flashing pattern helped orb weavers catch more prey.",
            "To test this, Li\u2019s team used black ink to paint over the lanterns of some caught fireflies. Without their prey flashing, orb weavers were now less likely to capture more fireflies.\u00a0",
            "Orb weavers seemed to affect fireflies\u2019 flashes in a very specific way. Trapped males that had been bitten and wrapped in a spider\u2019s silk stopped using one of their lanterns to pulse light. Flashing just a single lantern, the males\u2019 signal became weaker, single pulses of light.",
            "These blinks appeared much closer to a female\u2019s flash pattern. That gave Li\u2019s team the idea that orb weavers make caught male fireflies look like females. This now coaxed more male prey into their webs.",
            "The orb weavers also handled fireflies differently than non-flashing beetle species, Li reports. The spiders wrapped other beetles in a thick layer of silk. Then they almost immediately began to eat them. They wrapped the fireflies more lightly, leaving their lanterns still visible. Then the spiders stocked away the wrapped fireflies in their web.\u00a0",
            "As more fireflies get caught, Li says, the spiders \u201crepeat the sequence for each of them \u2014 and leave them there, just flashing.\u201d",
            "Scientists still aren\u2019t sure how exactly orb weavers change fireflies\u2019 flashing patterns, Nelson says. Li suspects the spider\u2019s bite or venom has something to do with it. He\u2019s now planning to test those ideas. His team also plans to look for orb weavers outside of southeast Asia that might also use this tactic."

            "In 2013, Ning Zeng came across a very old, very important log.",
            "At the time, he and his colleagues were digging a trench in the Canadian province of Quebec. They planned to fill it with 35 metric tons (39 U.S. tons) of wood. Then, they would cover that wood with clay soil and let it sit for nine years. The goal? To show that the wood wouldn\u2019t decompose.",
            "If it worked, this exercise would prove that that burying plant matter could be a cheap way to store carbon. Keeping such carbon from entering the atmosphere could help fight climate change.",
            "But while digging their trench, Zeng\u2019s team unearthed a pristine, twisted log. It was very old \u2014 older than anything they could have possibly produced in their experiment.",
            "\u201cI remember standing there just staring at it,\u201d says Zeng. He\u2019s a climate scientist at the University of Maryland in College Park. He recalls thinking, \u201cWow, do we really need to continue our experiment? The evidence is already here \u2014 and better than we could do.\u201d",
            "The uncovered log was once part of an Eastern red cedar. Some 3,775 years ago, this tree\u00a0had drawn carbon dioxide, or CO2, from the air and then used its carbon molecules for the creation of wood. When it died, the tree got buried beneath as little as two meters (6.5 feet) of clay soil.",
            "That barrier, it now turns out, allowed the log to hold onto at least 95 percent of its carbon. Zeng and his colleagues shared their findings September 24 in\u00a0Science.",

            "Just by growing, plants store the carbon from about 220 billion tons of CO2 each year. But much of that carbon will get released back to the air when the plants die and break down. Stopping just a fraction of that breakdown, by burying wood, could help. But this strategy relies on finding conditions that would stop air, water and microbes from breaking down buried carbon for a long time.",

            "Burying wood could cost as little as $30 to $100 per ton of CO2, the researchers estimate. That simplicity and low cost makes wood vaults more practical than other carbon-catching techniques, Zeng adds. For instance, tech designed to pull carbon directly from the air costs $100 to $300 per ton of CO2.",

            "Dandruff flakes on your hair or shoulders don\u2019t look good. The itchy scalp that comes with it is no fun, either. In fact, although dandruff shows up on your hair, the condition actually starts with your scalp.",

Dandruff is actually \u201ca greasy, flaky problem,\u201d she explains. Too much oil provides extra food for the harmful bacteria and yeast, driving the flake production. In fact, dandruff can affect parts of the body with glands that produce sebum, a natural oil.",
            "Dandruff can develop in people with every hair type. However, Black people may have higher rates than other groups, says a 2015 study by researchers at the University of Miami School of Medicine, in Florida.",

Most Black women in the study said they washed their hair once every week or two. A majority of the white participants said they shampooed at least every other day.",
            "Part of the reason for this difference may have to do with how curly their hair is.",
            "The outer layer of hair is the cuticle. Straight hair with a smooth cuticle quickly looks dull when it gets oily, notes Gabriela Daniels. She\u2019s a hair scientist at the London College of Fashion in England. (It\u2019s part of the University of the Arts London.) But on hair with tight curls and coils, the shingles \u2014 bits of the hair shaft on its outer layer, or cuticle \u2014 may not lie flat. That can make it reflect light differently. So, it may not look dirty as soon, Daniels says.",
            "More frequent hair-washing can help deal with dandruff, McMichael says. If you worry about shampoos drying out the hair, use them just near the scalp, she suggests.",
            "If flaking is a problem, try shampoos labeled as formulated to deal with dandruff. If those don\u2019t work, your doctor may prescribe you a stronger treatment.",

Cutting the corpus callosum quieted them. And it didn\u2019t seem to have a big effect on normal brain function.",

            "For the first time, scientists have measured a long-sought global electric field in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This ambipolar electric field had been predicted to exist decades ago. But it had never been detected \u2014 until now.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s the big whoop,\u201d says Glyn Collinson. He works at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. An atmospheric scientist, he was lead investigator for the Endurance rocket program. And what it\u2019s just detected, he says, is \u201ca whole frickin\u2019 new planetary-energy field that\u2019s never been measured before!\u201d",
            "The field is weak. At only 0.55 volt, it\u2019s about as strong as a watch battery, Collinson says. Still, that\u2019s strong enough to control the shape and evolution of Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. And the features it controls, he says, could affect the suitability of our planet for life.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to the DNA of our planet,\u201d Collinson says of this field. He led a team that confirmed its presence in the August 28 Nature.",

            "Learn more about this newfound third major \u201cfield\u201d that not only shapes the environment of our planet but also helps make it habitable. Though very weak, this electric field can still lift the atmosphere up and allow for a hitherto mysterious up-flowing polar wind.",
            "Scientists first predicted such an electric field in the 1960s. This was at the dawn of the space age. Early spacecraft flying over Earth\u2019s poles detected a supersonic outflow of ions \u2014 charged particles \u2014 exiting the atmosphere. They called it a polar wind.",
            "The most reasonable thing to explain that speedy wind would be some electric field. How? Sunlight might kick electrons out of atoms in the upper atmosphere. Those negatively charged electrons are energetic and light enough that they want to float out into space. Left behind are positively charged oxygen ions. Being heavier, they want to sink down in Earth\u2019s gravity.",
            "But the atmosphere wants to remain electrically neutral \u2014 neither positive nor negative \u2014 by keeping an equal balance between electrons and positive ions. So this electric field forms. It keeps the electrons tied to the ions, which prevents them from escaping.",
            "Once established, the field can act as a booster for lighter ions, such as hydrogen. It gives them enough energy to break free of Earth\u2019s gravity. Now they zoom away, forming that polar wind. The field also pulls heavier ions higher up into the atmosphere than they would otherwise reach. Here, other forces can propel them, too, into space.",
            "That was the hypothesis, anyway. But until very recently, technology to detect that field didn\u2019t exist.",
            "Being such a weak field, Collinson says, finding it \u201cwas genuinely thought impossible.\u201d",

            "He and his team had to develop a new instrument to measure it. They mounted this photoelectron spectrometer onto a rocket. They called the rocket Endurance. They named it for the ship that Ernest Shackleton\u2019s team took to explore Antarctica in 1914.",

            "Getting to the launchpad was a journey worthy of the rocket\u2019s name. They had to be as far into the polar region as possible. So the team traveled by boat for 17 hours to get to a Norwegian archipelago. Known as Svalbard, it\u2019s just 1,300 kilometers (815 miles) from the North Pole.",
            "Along the way, several members of the team got sick with COVID-19. Adding to tensions, the war between nearby Russia and Ukraine had begun just a few months earlier.",
            "So that explains \u201ca certain amount of nervousness about firing off rockets,\u201d Collinson recalls. \u201cPolar bears were the least of it. We had war and plague.\u201d",
            "Two more days of blizzards kept Endurance grounded. When the rocket finally launched on May 11, 2022, it went straight up through the atmosphere to a height of around 770 kilometers (480 miles). Along the way, it measured the energies of electrons every 10 seconds. The flight lasted 19 minutes. Afterward, the rocket fell back to Earth, splashing down in the Greenland Sea.",
            "Between 248 and 768 kilometers up, Endurance detected a change in the electric potential of 0.55 volt. That\u2019s not much. But it was exactly enough to explain the polar wind.",
            "The measurement is solid and exciting, says David Brain. A planetary scientist, he works at the University of Colorado Boulder and did not take part in the new work. He also cautions that it\u2019s only one data point and from just one rocket. \u201cThis result is a really great result,\u201d he says, but one that \u201cargues there should be more measurements like this.\u201d",
            "Collinson agrees. NASA recently approved his team to launch a follow-up rocket. It will be named Resolute for an Arctic-exploring ship that set sail in 1850.",
            "The ambipolar electric field helps control how quickly a planet\u2019s atmosphere escapes into space. As such, it likely plays some role in making a planet hospitable to life, Collinson says.",

            "Like Earth, the Venusian atmosphere has an electric field. But it\u2019s far stronger than Earth\u2019s and led to a far different evolution of its climate, as this animation explains.",
            "Both Mars and Venus also have electric fields. But in their cases, they might have fared better over time without them.",
            "For instance, Mars used to be more like Earth, scientists think. Over time, it lost much of its atmosphere to space. Indeed, that atmospheric \u201closs to space was a significant, if not dominant, process in changing [Mars\u2019] climate,\u201d Bruce Jakosky told Science News back in 2015. Jakosky, who works at the University of Colorado Boulder, led a team that measured that loss. And Venus used to be much wetter, data suggest.",
            "If such an electric field didn\u2019t exist on Venus and Mars, \u201cthen I think it\u2019s possible Venus and Mars would have lost less oxygen,\u201d Brain says \u2014 and therefore less water.",
            "Earth\u2019s ambipolar electric field helps kick its oxygen out into space, too. But Earth has one key advantage over Mars and Venus: It has a global magnetic field to guide charged particles around the planet.",

            "fCWithin the solar system, Venus appears to have started out as Earth\u2019s twin. But owing to a very different electric-field strength, Venus lost most water from its surface and atmosphere. Today, Venus is a very hot, dry place, while our planet is a relatively comfortable site teeming with life.",
            "\u201cThe electric field is the engine that gets the particles moving,\u201d Brain explains. \u201cThe magnetic field is sort of the road that the particles move along.\u201d Earth\u2019s magnetic field means oxygen can escape only near the poles, rather than from any or all parts of the atmosphere.",
            "And that, he adds, could help explain why Earth has kept its habitable atmosphere for so much longer than Venus or Mars.\u00a0",
            "\u201cFundamentally, what makes a planet habitable is going to be many things,\u201d Collinson says. \u201cBut I think comparing these different energy fields across different planets is a way to answer the question: Why is the Earth habitable?\u201d In other words, \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d",

            "For one thing, it appears that two known types of storm-powered gamma rays are more complex \u2014 and common \u2014 than scientists had thought. The new data also have unveiled a never-before-seen type of blast. It\u2019s called a flickering gamma-ray flash.",

            "The ER-2 plane soared over storms in the Caribbean and Central America in July 2023. It cruised at an altitude of about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles). That\u2019s roughly twice as high as commercial flights. Up there, the aircraft had a front-row seat to storm clouds\u2019 gamma-ray fireworks.",

These short, intense blasts are so bright that they can be seen from space. Each one lasts less than a thousandth of a second. The other known type are called gamma-ray glows. These emissions are dimmer but last longer.",

And the glow could span thousands of square kilometers (hundreds or thousands of square miles). The plane measured this type of emission on nine of its 10 flights. Nikolai \u00d8stgaard and his colleagues described these findings October 3 in\u00a0Nature.\u00a0",

This hints that past satellite data missed many of these flashes \u2014 which would appear to make them more common that scientists had thought. \u00d8stgaard and others shared that discovery September 7 in\u00a0Geophysical Research Letters.",
            "And then there are the newfound flickering gamma-ray flashes. These outbursts fall between the two other types of gamma-ray emissions in both brightness and duration. Like high-energy strobe lights, gamma-ray flickers consist of short pulses that repeat over tens to hundreds of milliseconds. \u00d8stgaard and the other researchers described these on October 3 in yet another Nature paper.",
            "Those flickers could help solve a couple key mysteries about thunderstorms. One is: How are their different types of gamma-ray outbursts related?",
            "Storms are known to produce gamma rays when electrons get accelerated in\u00a0strong electric fields\u00a0that build up inside clouds. These electrons produce more electrons, and so on. When electrons in this avalanche smash into air molecules, they throw off gamma rays. But it\u2019s still unknown what makes a cloud emit a terrestrial gamma-ray flash, versus a gamma-ray glow.",

            "Craters are round, bowl-shaped depressions surrounded by a ring, like the one shown in Figure 1. They are made when a\u00a0meteorite\u00a0collides with a\u00a0planet\u00a0or a\u00a0moon. Craters are what make our moon look like Swiss cheese. Each round hole is the place where a meteorite\u00a0impacted, or hit, the surface of the moon, so craters are often called\u00a0impact craters. Often, the meteorite that creates a crater explodes on impact, so the crater is an empty reminder of the collision.",
            "There are\u00a0meteoroids\u00a0traveling around throughout space, and all of the moons and planets in our solar system have been impacted by meteorites since its formation. (Note: they are called meteoroids when they\u2019re still in space, and meteorites when they land on a planet or moon.)",
            "On Earth, we only see a few impact craters, for a couple of different reasons. First, most meteoroids never reach the Earth\u2019s surface because they burn up in the atmosphere. This is what we are seeing when we watch a\u00a0shooting star\u00a0during a\u00a0meteor shower\u00a0(meteor\u00a0refers to the visible streak of light). Second, impact craters from meteorites can be changed by geological forces (like earthquakes and continental movements) or eroded away by atmospheric forces (like wind or rain). There is no atmosphere on the moon, which means that falling meteoroids do not burn up and there is no weather to erode away the craters. In fact, the footprints of the astronauts who landed on the moon over 50 years ago are still there!",

Not all of them are obvious because most are eroded, covered by sediment or under water. Each crater has to be identified using several different kinds of clues. First, geological clues are found by looking for pieces of the exploded, iron-rich meteorite or for glass that formed during the impact. Satellite imaging can be used to visualize crater formations that are beneath the Earth\u2019s surface or a body of water. Finally, chemical evidence is used to date the crater and find traces of elements that are more common in space than on our planet.",
            "By piecing together this evidence, scientists can study craters on Earth and link them to different periods of Earth\u2019s history. This involves many different types of scientists, including astronomers, geologists, chemists, paleontologists and meteorologists (who actually study weather, not meteorites). This has led to an interesting hypothesis being proposed about the formation of a sea, the extinction of the dinosaurs and even the origins of life!",

            "A full moon could make it easy for a werewolf to spot prey. But a bright night makes it easy to be spotted, too. ",
            "As the full moon rises, a mythical werewolf howls and heads out on the hunt. But is this the best time for werewolves to find a meal? In some stories, this transformation can happen at any time of the month or even during the day. And science suggests that a careful werewolf might want to schedule their change based on their goals.\u00a0",
            "The moon affects our world in several ways. As it orbits Earth, the moon pushes and pulls at the oceans to make tides. These tides can, in turn, influence the behavior of ocean creatures. And moonlight \u2014 a reflection of the sun \u2014 can also have power over the behavior of animals both on land and in the sea.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "If a werewolf is all big, scary predator, the full moon might be a blessing. But if the animal could face predators itself, it might want to save its transformation for a much darker night.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The dark depths of an ocean or stream might not seem like the obvious place for animals affected by the moon. But \u201cit is something that we see pretty commonly among aquatic critters,\u201d says Heidi Ballew. She\u2019s a marine ecologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ballew studies the \u2018O\u2018opu nakea (Awaous stamineus), a goby native to Hawaii. The hardy little fish are born in freshwater streams in the hills. From there, a goby\u2019s life can take two very different paths depending on when it\u2019s born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "When the moon is full, the sun, Earth and moon are lined up. This produces higher tides. Some gobies hatch during that full moon. The higher tides sweep their tiny bodies out to sea. When they are grown, higher tides during the new moon (when the sun, moon and Earth line up again) help them find their way back to their home streams. Special fins on their bellies, modified into suckers, help them climb waterfalls back to their birthplace. There, they mate and make more gobies.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/mmwM7dwtvKA?feature=oembed",
            "Waterfall? Not a problem. Watch a goby climb up a waterfall with her mouth and her sucker-like fin.\u00a0",
            "But not all gobies go out to see the world. Gobies born during the dark of a new moon stay home and never leave the stream where they are born.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Baby gobies are trying to avoid predation, Ballew says. \u201cA full moon provides a high tide. But it also produces a lot of light \u2014 even underwater.\u201d Night-hunting fish can better see tiny, defenseless gobies. So if a fish is going to stay put, hatching at the new moon is a safer bet.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "The moon matters even as they grow into adults. A big, well-fed baby goby may become an adult during the full moon. But a smaller goby might become an adult at the new moon instead. The darkness hides these still-small, newly adult gobies, keeping them safe from predators. Ballew and her colleagues published their fishy findings February 26 in the journal Ecology of Freshwater Fish.\u00a0",
            "So there are pros and cons to lots of moonlight. A full moon lights up the night and makes it easy to spot dinner. But if a werewolf is as likely to become prey as it is to go hunting, a new moon might help it hide.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "In one study, Ritchie and his colleagues took photos of animals in southeastern Australia at different phases of the moon. Prey species such as possums and rabbit-sized bandicoots were more active when nights were cloudy. The extra darkness provided cover to hide from predators.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "But predators such as quolls were also more active when it was darker \u2014 when the moon was new or half. Each species was trying to find a balance between getting more food and becoming someone else\u2019s dinner.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "\u201cPredators often use ambush to capture their prey,\u201d Ritchie says. \u201cThe lighter it is, the harder it might be [for predators] to avoid detection.\u201d While the prey might be able to spot a predator more easily, they, too, may be more detectable. \u201cThey [might] be more hesitant to be active, especially in areas without much cover to retreat to.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Ritchie and his colleagues published their findings in 2020 in the journal Australian Mammalogy.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Werewolves also need to find that balance between predator and prey. If a werewolf wanted to hunt as much as possible, \u201cthey would hunt humans by day and night,\u201d Ritchie says. But being a werewolf isn\u2019t without risk. \u201cMany prey, including humans, are often far from harmless.\u201d\u00a0",
            "In that case, Ballew says, a werewolf might be advised to vary its strategy. A big, strong werewolf could find good hunting during the full moon. But if a werewolf is small, young, or weak? \u201cMaybe you would want to utilize the new moon so that your predators are less likely to find you.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson a werewolf could learn from the gobies that stayed home.\u00a0\u00a0"

But since Percy\u00a0landed in Jezero Crater three years ago, scientists have struggled to identify organics, Stack Morgan says. That landing site was an ancient, dried-up lake.",
            "Adding to the new excitement, little white spots with black rims speckle the reddish rock sample that Percy found. \u201cThey look like a tricolored leopard spot,\u201d Stack Morgan says.",
            "Percy examined these spots using instruments that can identify the chemical recipe of materials. And the spots\u2019 rims contained iron phosphate. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry have been linked to ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create such rings can be an energy source for microbes.",

Some scientists think it\u2019s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called \u201cslab pull.\u201d In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It\u2019s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth\u2019s surface."

            "Many students study by reading their notes and textbooks over and over again. Research studies show there are more effective ways to use your valuable study time.",
            "As a teen, Faria Sana often highlighted books with markers. \u201cThe colors were supposed to tell me different things.\u201d Later, she recalls, \u201cI had no idea what those highlighted texts were supposed to mean.\u201d",
            "She also took lots of notes as she read. But often she was \u201cjust copying words or changing the words around.\u201d That work didn\u2019t help much either, she says now. In effect, \u201cit was just to practice my handwriting skills.\u201d",
            "\u201cNo one ever taught me how to study,\u201d Sana says. College got harder, so she worked to find better study skills. She\u2019s now a psychologist at Athabasca University in Alberta, Canada. There she studies how students can learn better.",
            "Having good study skills is always helpful. But it\u2019s even more important now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many students worry about family or friends who may get sick, Sana notes. Others feel more general stress. Beyond that, students in many countries are facing different formats for learning. Some schools are holding in-person classes again, with rules for spacing and masks. Others schools have staggered classes, with students at school part-time. Still others have all online classes, at least for a while.",
            "These conditions can distract from your lessons. Plus, students are likely to have to do more without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders. They will have to manage their time and study more on their own. Yet many students never learned those skills. To them, Sana says, it may be like telling students to learn to swim by \u201cjust swimming.\u201d",
            "The good news: Science can help.",
            "For more than 100 years, psychologists have done research on which study habits work best. Some tips help for almost every subject. For example, don\u2019t just cram! And test yourself, instead of just rereading the material. Other tactics work best for certain types of classes. This includes things like using graphs or mixing up what you study. Here are 10 tips to tweak your study habits.",
            "Nate Kornell \u201cdefinitely did cram\u201d before big tests when he was a student. He\u2019s a psychologist at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. He still thinks it\u2019s a good idea to study the day before a big test. But research shows it\u2019s a bad idea to cram all your studying into that day. Instead, space out those study sessions.",
            "*a_kid_sitting_at_a_table_studying_and_looking_really_stressed_out",
            "fCCramming before a big test can leave you exhausted. But you\u2019ll learn and remember material better if you space your study sessions over the course of several days. ",
            "In one 2009 experiment, college students studied vocabulary words with flash cards. Some students studied all the words in spaced-apart sessions throughout four days. Others studied smaller batches of the words in crammed, or massed, sessions, each over a single day. Both groups spent the same amount of time overall. But testing showed that the first group learned the words better.",
            "Kornell compares our memory to water in a bucket that has a small leak. Try to refill the bucket while it\u2019s still full, and you can\u2019t add much more water. Allow time between study sessions, and some of the material may drip out of your memory. But then you\u2019ll be able to relearn it and learn more in your next study session. And you\u2019ll remember it better, next time, he notes.",
            "Musicians practice their instruments. Athletes practice sports skills. The same should go for learning.",
            "\u201cIf you want to be able to remember information, the best thing you can do is practice,\u201d says Katherine Rawson. She\u2019s a psychologist at Kent State University in Ohio. In one 2013 study, students took practice tests over several weeks. On the final test, they scored more than a full letter grade better, on average, than did students who studied the way they normally had.",
            "In a study done a few years earlier, college students read material and then took recall tests. Some took just one test. Others took several tests with short breaks of several minutes in between. The second group recalled the material better a week later.",
            "As a teen, Cynthia Nebel studied by reading her textbooks, worksheets and notebooks. \u201cOver and over and over again,\u201d recalls this psychologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Now, she adds, \u201cwe know that\u2019s one of the most common bad study skills that students have.\u201d",
            "In one 2009 study, some college students read a text twice. Others read a text just once. Both groups took a test right after the reading. Test results differed little between these groups, Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel found. She is now at Wheaton College in Illinois. He works at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.",
            "Too often, when students reread material, it\u2019s superficial, says McDaniel, who also co-wrote the 2014 book, Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning. Rereading is like looking at the answer to a puzzle, rather than doing it yourself, he says. It looks like it makes sense. But until you try it yourself, you don\u2019t really know if you understand it.",
            "One of McDaniel\u2019s coauthors of Make it Stick is Henry Roediger. He, too, works at Washington University. In one 2010 study, Roediger and two other colleagues compared test results of students who reread material to two other groups. One group wrote questions about the material. The other group answered questions from someone else. Those who answered the questions did best. Those who just reread the material did worst.",
            "That 2010 study backs up one of Nebel\u2019s preferred study habits. Before big tests, her mom quizzed her on the material. \u201cNow I know that was retrieval practice,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best ways you can study.\u201d As Nebel got older, she quizzed herself. For example, she might cover up the definitions in her notebook. Then she tried to recall what each term meant.",
            "*a_girl_explaining_something_to_her_mom",
            "fCYou\u2019ll understand and remember information better if you can explain it to someone else. And if you can\u2019t explain it, you probably don\u2019t understand it well enough yet. ",
            "Such retrieval practice can help nearly everyone, Rawson and others showed in an August 2020 study in Learning and Instruction. This research included college students with an attention problem known as ADHD. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Overall, retrieval helped students with ADHD and those without the disorder equally well.\u00a0",
            "\u201cCreate a deck of flash cards every time you learn new information,\u201d Sana suggests. \u201cPut questions on one side and the answers on the other side.\u201d Friends can even quiz each other on the phone, she says.",
            "\u201cTry to quiz yourself the way the teacher asks questions,\u201d Nebel adds.",
            "But really grill yourself and your friends, she says. And here\u2019s why. She was part of a team that asked students to write one quiz question for each class period. Students would then answer a question from another classmate. Preliminary data show that students did worse on tests afterward than when the daily quiz questions came from the teacher. Nebel\u2019s team is still analyzing the data. She suspects the students\u2019 questions may have been too simple.",
            "Teachers often dig deeper, she notes. They don\u2019t just ask for definitions. Often, teachers ask students to compare and contrast ideas. That takes some critical thinking.",
            "It\u2019s crucial to test your memory. But it doesn\u2019t really matter how many seconds you spend on each try. That finding comes from a 2016 study by Kornell and others. But it\u2019s important to go the next step, Kornell adds: Check to see if you were right. Then focus on what you got wrong.",
            "\u201cIf you don\u2019t find out what the answer is, you\u2019re kind of wasting your time,\u201d he says. On the flip side, checking the answers can make your study time more efficient. You can then focus on where you need the most help.",
            "In fact, making mistakes can be a good thing, argues Stuart Firestein. A Columbia University biologist in New York City, he actually wrote the book on it. It\u2019s called Failure: Why Science is So Successful. Mistakes, he argues, are actually a primary key to learning.",
            "In many cases, it helps to mix up your self-testing. Don\u2019t just focus on one thing. Drill yourself on different concepts. Psychologists call this interleaving.",
            "*a_photo_of_a_young_asian_man_studying_his_notes_while_lying_in_bed",
            "fCTry to solve problems and recall information on your own. Then check to see if you\u2019re right. Retrieval practice boosts your learning and memory, say psychologists.",
            "Actually, your tests usually will have questions mixed up, too. More importantly, interleaving can help you learn better. If you practice one concept over and over \u201cyour attention decreases because you know what\u2019s coming up next,\u201d Sana explains. Mix up your practice, and you now space the concepts apart. You can also see how concepts differ, form trends or fit together in some other way.",
            "Suppose, for instance, you\u2019re learning about the volume of different shapes in math. You could do lots of problems on the volume of a wedge. Then you could answer more batches of questions, with each set dealing with just one shape. Or, you could figure out the volume of a cone, followed by a wedge. Next you might find the volume for a half-cone or a spheroid. Then you can mix them up some more. You might even mix in some practice on addition or division.",
            "Rawson and others had groups of college students try each of those approaches. Those who interleaved their practice questions did better than the group that did single-batch practice, the researchers reported last year in Memory & Cognition.",
            "A year earlier, Sana and others showed that interleaving can help students with both strong and weak working memory. Working memory lets you remember where you are in an activity, such as following a recipe.",
            "Pay attention to diagrams and graphs in your class materials, says Nebel. \u201cThose pictures can really boost your memory of this material. And if there aren\u2019t pictures, creating them can be really, really useful.\u201d",
            "*_a_diagram_of_a_neuron",
            "fCPay attention to drawings, graphics, chart and other visual aids. Psychologist Mark McDaniel at Washington University in St. Louis, Mo., says a diagram of a nerve cell helped when he studied neuroscience in college.",
            "\u201cI think these visual representations help you create more complete mental models,\u201d McDaniel says. He and Dung Bui, then also at Washington University, had students listen to a lecture on car brakes and pumps. One group got diagrams and was told to add notes as needed to the diagrams. Another group got an outline for writing notes. The third group just took notes. The outlines helped students if they were otherwise good at building mental models of what they were reading. But in these tests, they found, visual aids helped students across the board.",
            "Even goofy pictures might help. Nikol Rummel is a psychologist at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. In one study back in 2003, she and others gave cartoon drawings to college students along with information about five scientists who studied intelligence. For example, the text about Alfred Binet came with a drawing of a race car driver. The driver wore a bonnet to protect his brain. Students who saw the drawings did better on a test than did those who got only the text information.",
            "Abstract concepts can be hard to understand. It tends to be far easier to form a mental image if you have a concrete example of something, Nebel says.",
            "For instance, sour foods usually taste that way because they contain an acid. On its own, that concept might be hard to remember. But if you think about a lemon or vinegar, it\u2019s easier to understand and remember that acids and sour go together. And the examples might help you to identify other foods\u2019 taste as being due to acids.",
            "Indeed, it helps to have at least two examples if you want to apply information to new situations. Nebel and others reviewed studies on this in July 2019. Their Journal of Food Science Education report describes how students can improve their study skills.",
            "It\u2019s hard to remember a string of facts and figures if you don\u2019t push further. Ask why things are a certain way. How did they come about? Why do they matter? Psychologists call this elaboration. It\u2019s taking class material and \u201casking a lot of how and why questions about it,\u201d Nebel says. In other words, don\u2019t just accept facts at face value.",
            "Elaboration helps you combine new information with other things you know. And it creates a bigger network in your brain of things that relate to one another, she says. That larger network makes it easier to learn and remember things.",
            "*an_illustration_of_a_man_driving_a_blue_car",
            "fCYou\u2019ll remember facts if you ask questions about why they\u2019re so and how they fit with other things. For example, suppose a hungry man drove a car. Why might he do that? ",
            "Suppose you\u2019re asked to remember a string of facts about different men, says McDaniel. For example, \u201cThe hungry man got into the car. The strong man helped the woman. The brave man ran into the house.\u201d And so on. In one of his studies back in the \u201880s, college students had trouble remembering the bare statements. They did better when researchers gave them explanations for each man\u2019s action. And the students remembered a whole lot better when they had to answer questions about why each man did something.",
            "\u201cGood understanding produces really good memory,\u201d McDaniel says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s key for a lot of students.\u201d If information just seems sort of random, ask more questions. Make sure you can explain the material. Better yet, he says, see if you can explain it to someone else. Some of his college students do this by calling home to explain what they\u2019re learning to their parents.",
            "Many students know they should space out study periods, quiz themselves and practice other good skills. Yet many don\u2019t actually do those things. Often, they fail to plan ahead.",
            "Back when Rawson was a student, she used a paper calendar for her planning. She wrote in the date for each exam. \u201cAnd then for four or five other days,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI wrote in time to study.\u201d",
            "*a_photo_of_a_person_running_away_from_the_viewer_on_a_leafy_path,_zoomed_in_on_the_feet_and_lower_le",
            "fCBuild breaks for exercise into your study schedule too. Even a few minutes outside can help you perk up for more studying.",
            "Try to stick to a routine, too. Have a set time and place where you do schoolwork and studying. It may seem odd at first. But, Kornell assures you, \u201cby the time week two rolls around, it becomes a normal thing.\u201d And put your phone somewhere else while you work, adds Nebel.Allow yourself short breaks. Set a timer for 25 minutes or so, suggests Sana. Study during that time, with no distractions. When the timer goes off, take a five or 10 minute break. Exercise. Check your phone. Maybe drink some water \u2014 whatever. Afterward, set the timer again.",
            "\u201cIf you have a study plan, stick to it!\u201d adds McDaniel. Recently, he and psychologist Gilles Einstein at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., looked at why students don\u2019t use good study skills. Many students know what those skills are, they report. But often they don\u2019t plan when they intend to put them in action. Even when students do make plans, something more enticing may come up. Studying has to become a priority, they say. The team published its report in Perspectives on Psychological Science on July 23.",
            "Try to stick to a regular routine. And get enough sleep \u2014 not just the night before the test but for weeks or months on end. \u201cThose things are really, really important for learning,\u201d Nebel says. Exercise helps as well, she says.",
            "Don\u2019t stress out if all of this seems like a lot, she adds. If a lot seems new, try adding just one new study skill each week or two. Or at least space out your study sessions and practice retrieval for the first few months. As you get more practice, you can add more skills. And if you need help, ask.",
            "Finally, if you struggle to follow the advice above (such as you can\u2019t keep track of time or find it very hard to just sit and focus on your work), you may have an undiagnosed condition, such as ADHD. To find out, check with your doctor. The good news: It may be treatable.",
            "Doing schoolwork during a pandemic is a tough situation at best. But remember your teachers and classmates also face challenges. Like you, they have fears, concerns and questions. Be willing to cut them some slack. And be kind to yourself as well. After all, Kornell says, \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d"

Are you reading a news story on the front page of a newspaper? Then it\u2019s trying to inform you. Is it a column on the editorial page?

            "Most plastics have been made from crude oil, a fossil fuel. Four years ago, Burkart\u2019s team at UCSD developed a new type. They made it from building blocks that can be produced by algae. Now, they\u2019ve shown that this plastic breaks down quickly when a particular species of bacteria dine on it.",
            "The researchers described the finding March 12 in Scientific Reports.",
            "In the environment, larger plastic pieces tend to break down into tinier and tinier bits. If the starting plastic is made from fossil fuels, those bits can take centuries to break down completely. In contrast, Burkart\u2019s team reports the new plastic shouldn\u2019t stick around long enough to harm wildlife (or us).",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "The new plastic is a type of polyurethane. Such plastics are used to make foams, paints and adhesives, among other things. The new, biodegradable type contains many chemical building blocks. Small chemical groups known as esters link all those building blocks into a long chain. Bacteria can break apart those esters, releasing the building blocks.",
            "Those building blocks are made from ingredients produced by plants and algae. Many types of microbes break down plants and algae and eat those building blocks. The researchers suspected those microbes might do the same thing to the building blocks of the new plastic.",
            "To test that, Burkart\u2019s team broke their new plastic into tiny particles. They did the same with a different type of plastic made from fossil fuels. It\u2019s known as ethyl vinyl acetate, or EVA. Then researchers mixed these microplastics with fresh compost \u2014 a moist mix of decomposed plants, food waste and microbes. After 90 days, 68 percent of the new plastic had broken down. That number climbed to 97 percent after about seven months. In contrast, the researchers saw no EVA breakdown throughout that time.",

To break down the microplastics, \u201cyou need them to be wet 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you break that cycle, even for a short period of time, you kill the microorganisms.\u201d",

            "The new plastic\u2019s breakdown released just as much CO2 as when the microbes ate the same amount of cellulose. This suggests the microbes were breaking down the plastic about as well as they do plants. The scientists even found one bacterium that can survive just by munching bits of the new plastic.",
            "Finally, the UCSD team made a cell phone case from a similar polyurethane that microbes can break down. They left it in moist compost for a year. Afterwards, the case was brittle and discolored. Those changes indicate that microbes living naturally in the compost were breaking it down.",

            "There are two main types of carbon capture. One removes CO2 that\u2019s already in the atmosphere. That\u2019s called non-point-source capture. The other removes CO2 from the source \u2014 where it is made \u2014 so it never enters the atmosphere. That\u2019s called point-source capture.",
            "Point-source carbon capture is used in some industries that produce a lot of CO2, such as steel- and cement-making. One type of point-source carbon capture uses a liquid to remove CO2 before it billows out of a smokestack. Another approach uses special materials that cling to CO2 molecules, removing them from emissions. Once captured, this carbon must be used or pumped deep underground for storage.",
            "Non-point-source carbon capture removes CO2 from the atmosphere \u2014 after it has escaped from where it was made. One approach uses tanks filled with a kind of algae called microalgae. Like plants, these algae carry out photosynthesis. This process converts CO2 in the air into sugar, which the algae use to grow and reproduce. When algae reproduce \u2014 giving rise to more algae \u2014 they\u2019ve turned CO2 into biomass, the matter that makes up organisms. That removes CO2 from the air. The algae\u2019s biomass might then be stored or used to make fertilizers or other valuable products.",

Others point to the risks of carbon capture, such as leakage of the stored CO2. Carbon capture technologies remain one of several approaches to tackling climate change.",

That means diners don\u2019t have to bite into any heads, legs or wormy bodies. But some extraction methods can degrade certain health benefits of that protein.",
            "The new work seeks to prevent that. If it succeeds, it could open up new prospects for insect-based foods.\u00a0",
            "We need protein in our diets. That can come from sources such as beans, tofu, eggs or meat. Meat is high in protein. But some insect proteins may be healthier for us than the meat of larger animals, such as beef, fish or chicken. Farming insects is also better for the planet than other types of livestock. It uses less land, water and energy. And it produces fewer greenhouse gases, such as methane.",

            "But there\u2019s more. Many edible insects are full of vitamins and minerals. They also contain other compounds, such as amino acids and peptides, that can promote good health. In fact, some of these compounds are being studied to treat ailments such as cancer and heart disease. Extracting them from insects might lead to new health supplements.\u00a0",
            "To get there, science will have to pass a few hurdles. First is chitin (KY-tehn). It makes up the crunchy exoskeleton on many arthropods, from insects and arachnids to shellfish. Insect larvae contain some chitin, too. This sugar-based polymer binds to proteins and makes them hard to digest. So diners who eat whole insects won\u2019t get full nutritional benefit from their proteins.",
            "Treatment can separate out that chitin. Now, people can better absorb the protein.",
            "But there\u2019s still the yuck factor. Eating insects is normal in some parts of the world. Many of us don\u2019t want to eat insects, however \u2014 no matter how nutritious they may be. And it\u2019s hard to ignore that you\u2019re eating insects if you crunch on their legs or wings. That\u2019s a big reason why Kim focuses on turning the beneficial parts into a powder.",

Then, they mixed in one of three solutions to dissolve the proteins out of the defatted worms. One solution was sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Another contained a salt. The third contained enzymes. Lastly, they freeze-dried the mix to remove water. The leftover material was crushed into a powder.",

This squeezed out any liquids. It\u2019s similar to how olive oil is extracted from whole olives. Next, the team strained the liquid and freeze-dried it (to remove water).

If you measure the properties of one particle, you automatically know the properties of the other. And whatever happens to one will also affect the other.",

            "Yes, mayonnaise, the same stuff you might put on a sandwich. Dollops of the condiment could help scientists better design nuclear fusion experiments.",
            "Mayonnaise is useful for smearing on sandwiches and\u00a0 prepping potato salads. But scientists are now using it to study nuclear fusion.",
            "How mayonnaise behaves can vary. If jiggled gently, it returns to its original shape. That\u2019s called elastic behavior \u2014 like how an elastic hair band will return to its original shape after you stretch it. But fling the mayo forcefully and it takes on plastic behavior. That means it permanently changes its shape or can even break apart. (You\u2019re probably more familiar with the term \u201cplastic\u201d to describe the material that makes up soda bottles, LEGOs and more. The two terms are related. Plastic, the material, is named after its ability to be molded or deformed into various shapes.)",
            "This elastic-to-plastic morphing also can also take place in tests that use lasers to kick off nuclear fusion. That\u2019s the process where slamming two lightweight atoms together hard enough can make them merge. The mass of this combo is less than the sum of each starting atom. That\u2019s because some of that mass is converted into energy. So the process releases an enormous amount of energy.",
            "Scientists want to learn how to control fusion so they can one day use it to generate electricity.",
            "Scientists have been working to ignite a fusion reaction in the lab that releases more energy than went into it. Last December they succeeded. Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California beamed 192 lasers at a small chamber containing fuel. This raised the pressures and temperatures so high inside the fuel that the nuclei of its atoms fused. And those fusion reactions released more energy than had been needed to set them off.",
            "But it\u2019s difficult to study how materials behave under the extreme conditions required for fusion. And that\u2019s where the mayonnaise comes in.",
            "The behavior of the fuel capsule in fusion experiments, it turns out, has a lot in common with mayonnaise. The fuel capsule is a metal or other material that contains a gas (the fuel). When lasers hit the capsule, it melts. The melty capsule can now switch from elastic to plastic.",
            "The molten capsule has some properties of a solid. Like gloopy mayo, it doesn\u2019t flow on its own. Under enough force, however, it can break apart. If the capsule becomes plastic before fusion occurs, the gas could escape. And that could prevent fusion from taking place.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Two mechanical engineers at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., wanted to understand that better. So they looked at how mayo mixes with a gas \u2014 air. Aren Boyaci and Arindam Banerjee spun a wheel into which they\u2019d dropped dollops of mayo. The centrifugal force of the spinning wheel accelerated that mayo into the air. Here, the mayo acts like the melted capsule, and the air acts like the gaseous fuel.",
            "The scientists observed the glob while the wheel was spinning. They looked at it again after it stopped. They checked whether the mayo had returned to its original form, changed shape or broken apart. This determined the border between its elastic and plastic behaviors, they explain in the May Physical Review E.",
            "Working with mayo does have one drawback. When you show up in the supermarket checkout line with 48 containers of mayo, you\u2019re bound to attract attention. \u201cWe sometimes get a lot of questions from the grocery stores,\u201d Banerjee says, asking \u201cwhy we are buying that much mayonnaise.\u201d"

            "*A_photo_of_a_hand_with_a_paper_cut_on_the_index_finger",
            "A piece of paper\u2019s thickness and slicing angle affect its ability to cut through skin, physicists report.",
            "Tiny as they are, paper cuts can cause real pain.",
            "It\u2019s common to get a minor cut while flipping through a magazine or book. But tissue paper is not likely to draw blood. Now, scientists have explained the physics behind why some paper is more likely to slice through skin.",
            "Physicist Kaare Jensen was part of a team that set up experiments to study this. They used a gelatin replica of human tissue. Jensen works at the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. A thickness of around 65 micrometers (not quite 3 thousandths of an inch) was the sweet spot for paper cuts, they found. (Or you might call it the sore spot!) Their findings got posted June 19 in Physical Review E.",
            "A thin sheet of paper wouldn\u2019t cut; it would bend instead. Thicker paper made a dent in the gelatin but couldn\u2019t break its surface. Like a dull knife blade, it couldn\u2019t apply enough force over a small enough area of the material to pierce it.",
            "The most treacherous paper tested was the kind used in old-fashioned dot matrix printers. Good news for fingers everywhere: That paper isn\u2019t used much anymore. Magazine paper ranked a close second in the scientists\u2019 tests.",
            "The slicing angle also mattered. Pressing the paper\u2019s edge straight down into the gelatin was less likely to cause a cut than if the paper\u2019s path angled across and down.",
            "Next, the researchers put paper\u2019s slicing powers to use. They designed a 3-D printed tool they call the Papermachete. Loaded with a strip of printer paper, the tool becomes a single-use knife. The paper blade can cut into cucumber, pepper and apple. It can even cut chicken. The tool could be a low-cost option for prepping some foods.",
            "Next, the researchers plan to study more realistic, finger-shaped materials, rather than flat sheets of gelatin, says Jensen.",
            "No human fingers were harmed in the making of the study. \u201cIdeally, you would want some test subjects,\u201d Jensen says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to find volunteers.\u201d"

        "content": [
            "*a_model_of_a_uman_heart_behind_illustrated_ECG_traces",
            "The heart beats steadily from long before you\u2019re born to the day you die. Triggering each beat (illustrated in background by an electrocardiogram line) is a zap of electricity \u2014 literally the pulse of life. ",
            "Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day. That\u2019s around 3 billion times over an average lifetime. Each beat pumps blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. From there, it flows on to all of the rest of our cells, bringing nutrients and life-sustaining oxygen and carrying away wastes.",
            "When we sit quietly in a chair, our hearts typically beat between 60 and 100 times per minute. But very fit people can have as few as 40 to 50 heartbeats per minute. When you\u2019re exercising, stressed or angry, your heart rate will speed up. How fast? The usual estimate for how fast your heart can beat is 220 beats per minute, minus your age (in years). So a 13-year-old would have a maximum heart rate of 207 beats per minute.",
            "Our hearts are made up of millions of muscle cells. And no matter how your heart rate changes, all of those cells still contract \u2014 and beat \u2014 in the right order. And they do it over and over without stopping.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/GMBSU-2GK3E?feature=oembed",
            "See how various parts of the heart rhythmically contract to move blood throughout the body.",
            "Each heartbeat is divided into two segments, which sound like \u201club-DUB.\u201d You can hear this if you put your ear on someone\u2019s chest or use a stethoscope. The rhythm comes from the pumping of blood as the heart\u2019s four chambers contract.",
            "Each beat starts in the heart\u2019s two upper chambers \u2014 the right and left atrium. The right atrium fills with low-oxygen blood that is returning from a circuit around the body. The left atrium fills with blood coming from the lungs, where it picked up oxygen.",
            "These atria push blood down into two bigger, muscular chambers below them \u2014 the right and left ventricles. When the ventricles are full, valves close so the blood can\u2019t flow back to the atria. That\u2019s the \u201club\u201d sound.",
            "Now the ventricles contract. The right ventricle sends the low-oxygen blood to the lungs where it can pick up a new supply of oxygen. The left ventricle takes oxygen-rich blood and pumps it out to the rest of the body. Then the valves in those ventricles close to keep the blood from coming back in. That\u2019s the \u201cDUB\u201d sound.",
            "Lub-DUB. Lub-DUB. The rhythm can speed up or slow down. But it always happens in the same order.",
            "It might be easy to think that the brain controls this action. After all, it controls our muscles and other organs. But while the heart takes some input from the brain, it has a \u201cmind\u201d of its own.",
            "If the four chambers of the heart are a four-piece band, all beating in rhythm, their conductor is the sino-atrial node. It is sometimes called the SA node or sinus node. It\u2019s the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.",
            "*an_animation_showing_the_electrical_signal_that_travels_through_the_various_parts_of_the_heart_to_ca",
            "fCKalumet/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)",
            "This animation shows the electrical signal, or action potential, coming from the heart\u2019s right sino-atrial node (at animation\u2019s top left). That signal (in red) moves on to the atrio-ventricular node at center of the heart before spreading to the heart\u2019s ventricles. This signal is what makes the chambers of the heart contract in a coordinated rhythm. The line at the bottom shows the electrical signal, like you might see in an electrocardiogram or EKG.",
            "This tiny bundle of cells is about the size of two grains of rice, laying end to end. It sits atop the right atrium. Electricity sets the rate at which this pacemaker fires a zap of electricity into the heart\u2019s two upper chambers.",
            "That signal then travels to another clump of cells that sit between the heart\u2019s upper and lower chambers, explains Edward Lakatta. He\u2019s a cardiologist, or doctor who studies and treats diseases of the heart. He works at the National Institutes of Health in the Laboratory of Cardiovascular Science. It\u2019s in Baltimore, Md. This second clump of cells makes up the AV node. That\u2019s short for atrio-ventricular node. It\u2019s an electrical transfer station.",
            "The AV node shuttles an electric pacing signal down to the heart\u2019s lower chambers. This jolts the muscle cells that make up the walls of each ventricle. Called an action potential, this zap \u201cwakes up heart cells in the ventricle,\u201d Lakatta says, and asks them to squeeze. This action, he explains will \u201cpump the blood out of the bottom part of the heart and throughout your body.\u201d",
            "That, in a nutshell, is one heartbeat. And it happens about 60 times each minute \u2014\u00a0from before we\u2019re born to the time we die."
