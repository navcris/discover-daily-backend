            "About 600 snake species are venomous. Pictured here is a venomous prairie rattlesnake. But snakes are the only animals with potent potential. From sea urchins to platypuses, lots of animals produce venom.",
            "Venom packs a vicious and often deadly punch. A potent, venom-laced bite can unleash a rapid storm of gory symptoms. They include paralysis, rotten flesh and even organ failure. Snakes may be the most famous venomous creatures. Snakebites cause an average of 100,000 deaths worldwide each year. But throughout the animal kingdom, critters on land and sea can produce this toxic tool.",
            "Venom is a toxic secretion that some animals release with a bite, poke or sting. That delivery method is the key difference between venom and poison. Venomous animals inject their toxins with a puncture wound. They might use teeth, fangs, spikes, spurs or stingers. Poisonous animals, on the other hand, are usually harmful only when eaten or touched.",
            "Venomous species include snakes, fishes, spiders, lizards and insects. Marine invertebrates, such as corals or sea urchins, also produce venom. Even some mammals are venomous. Male platypuses have venom-injecting spurs on their feet that they use to stab their prey.",
            "Most venom is a mix of toxic enzymes and proteins. The mixture varies from species to species, as do the effects. Venom that has neurotoxins, for instance, might paralyze prey or make it twitch and shake violently. Hemotoxins damage blood vessels, causing blood clots or internal bleeding. Some venom sparks aggressive allergic reactions. Prey might break out in blisters or experience severe inflammation.\u00a0",
            "Symptoms set in and worsen quickly. Within hours, venom can cause complete paralysis, loss of limbs or extremely painful death. Antivenom can be used to reverse such damage. This type of medicine contains antibodies that bind to toxins. This triggers an immune system response that can destroy the harmful substance.",
            "Antivenom has historically been created by injecting small doses of a venom into an animal like a horse or sheep. The animal\u2019s immune system creates antibodies in response. Later, blood or plasma samples are taken from the animal to extract the venom-fighting antibodies.",
            "But now researchers are also developing antivenom in labs. One team used artificial intelligence to design toxin-targeting proteins that act like antibodies. In mice, the AI-designed proteins saved lives.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "It\u2019s important to know how to identify the venomous critters near the places you live or visit. Staying on trails and giving animals lots of space is a good way to stay safe. Most animals use venom to hunt or defend themselves. Remember, if you leave it alone, it will probably leave you alone too.",

A wider range of calcium-isotope levels points to a more varied diet.\u00a0",

But it ate rougher stuff \u2014 woody plants and twigs, the study now concludes.",

The fierce Allosaurus, in contrast, dined mostly on the flesh of other dinosaurs. But Allosaurus didn\u2019t munch much on bones, as Tyrannosaurus rex did. Both T. rex and Allosaurus are theropods that stood on two legs.",

You hear high-frequency sounds as those with high pitches. Think of a singing bird, a mouse\u2019s squeak or a whistle. Longer wavelengths come with lower frequencies. Low-frequency sounds have lower pitches. A lion\u2019s roar, a rumble of thunder or the bass line in a song are all low pitches.",

For breathing \u201ccleaner air \u2014 averaged over a day \u2014 put a HEPA filter in your bedroom,\u201d he says. As an alternative, you can even duct-tape five furnace filters together. Then direct air through it with an electric fan. Remember to keep the windows closed.",

            "Anything that reduces the levels of nitrogen oxides helps. They\u2019re toxic by themselves. Plus they boost ozone to dangerous levels during heat waves. So walking, biking and taking a bus or train instead of driving can help limit traffic pollution. Switching from gasoline-powered to electric vehicles (EVs) also helps, because EVs don\u2019t emit exhaust. Even better if the power to charge them comes from green sources, such as solar or wind.",
            "A long-term strategy for improving air quality, says Dickerson, is \u201ccombating climate change itself.\u201d The hope, he says, is that this will mean \u201cheat waves happen less often, are less severe and are shorter.\u201d And one great way to address climate change?

            "Humans have been generating space junk for as long as we have been exploring space. This junk includes discarded rocket boosters, old satellites and fragments left over when objects collide. In 2009, for example, two satellites crashed nearly 800 kilometers (about 500 miles) above Siberia. The crash created thousands of new pieces of space junk.",
            "Items lost during space missions make up a small amount of space junk. In 1965, American astronaut Ed White lost a glove during a spacewalk. Other astronauts have lost cameras, tools and even a toothbrush.",
            "Space junk is a growing problem. That\u2019s because it shares the same, well, space, as other objects that orbit Earth. One of those objects is the International Space Station. There\u2019s also weather, communication and other satellites people on Earth rely on.",
            "Objects in orbit around Earth typically zoom at scorching speeds. Space junk can zip around at up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) per second \u2014 or 29,000 kilometers (18,000 miles) per hour. At such speeds, any collision \u2014 even with something tiny \u2014 could rip holes in a spacecraft or damage satellites.",
            "More than 36,500 pieces of space junk larger than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) orbit Earth today. They\u2019re joined by more than 300 million even smaller pieces. As more trash ends up in space, more collisions will likely occur. Those collisions will break the trash into smaller \u2014 but still dangerous \u2014 pieces.",
            "Some space junk eventually re-enters the atmosphere. But that can take a long time. Debris orbiting closer to the Earth may fall into the atmosphere after a few years. Objects farther out may take hundreds or thousands of years.",
            "On re-entry, smaller space junk typically burns up in the atmosphere. So, it rarely hits Earth. But large pieces sometimes do. Debris from Skylab \u2014 an abandoned space station \u2014 fell from orbit on July 11, 1979. Chunks of the station fell over Western Australia and the Indian Ocean. Australian officials fined NASA $400 for littering.",

            "One clue to where water came from is how much of it is \u201csemi-heavy.\u201d In semi-heavy water molecules, one hydrogen is replaced with a hefty form of the element called deuterium. Deuterium contains a neutron in its nucleus along with a single proton. Instead of H2O, semi-heavy water is HDO.",

            "Water with a high ratio of HDO to H2O likely formed in a very cold place. Say, a frigid, star-forming cloud of gas, dust and ice. Earth\u2019s oceans have a higher ratio of HDO to H2O than our sun does. That has led astronomers to suspect that some of our water came from ice in the dark cloud where the sun was born.",
            "To find out, scientists need to know more about the ratio of HDO to H2O ice in the chilly nurseries where sunlike stars form. They also want to know how that ratio may change over a star\u2019s lifetime. \u00a0",
            "Astronomers can spot semi-heavy water ice in space by its interactions with light. But it\u2019s hard to see these signs from Earth. So researchers used data from when the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) peered at the star L1527.",
            "At just 100,000 years old, L1527 is an infant compared with our 4.5-billion-year-old sun. But its size and surroundings suggest it could grow up to look a lot like the sun. The dust and gas around this star are forming a disk. L1527 is gobbling up some of this material. What\u2019s left behind could someday form planets \u2014 as happened in our solar system.",
            "JWST saw a fairly high ratio of HDO to H2O ice in the stuff swaddling L1527. The researchers compared that ratio with the ice and gas around other baby stars, including slightly older ones. That suggested that the HDO to H2O ratio around a star might not change much as the star evolves. The team also compared L1527\u2019s HDO to H2O ratio with that of the ice seen on comets and meteorites in our solar system.",
            "The team shared its findings in the June 20 Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
            "These observations offer new details about what happens to water as stars mature. This may help scientists figure out where Earth\u2019s water came from. And that, in turn, could help pin down what it takes to make a planet habitable. But first, astronomers will need to observe the water around more baby stars \u2014 in both ice and gas forms.",

            "Here\u2019s a no-jab way to get vaccinated. Just open your mouth and floss. This approach works well in mice, scientists report. They hope a version for people could work, too.",
            "Not all vaccines are delivered with a needle. Some target the moist tissues in our bodies. Known as mucus membranes, we have them in our mouth and nose. Germs often invade the body through these mucus membranes. Building immune defenses in these parts helps disarm viruses upon entry. The flu virus, for example, usually enters our body through the nose. Then it heads toward the lungs.",
            "Protecting mucus membranes can be challenging. These moist tissues come into direct contact with the air and germs around us. Their cells are tightly packed to help keep pathogens out. But that can make it tricky to get a vaccine in and prompt an immune response.\u00a0",
            "Researchers have designed vaccines before that target places in the mouth, where cells aren\u2019t quite as close together. To do this, they used cheek patches or liquid drops under the tongue.",
            "Harvinder Gill, a bioengineer at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, came up with another idea. While reading a paper on dental structure, he learned about a leaky collection of cells at the base of a small pocket, where gums attach to teeth. Maybe here, he thought, is where his team should try to introduce a vaccine.",
            "There\u2019s just one problem. This pocket \u2014 the junctional epithelium \u2014 sits below the gumline. That makes it hard to reach.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "\u201cWe needed something more precise [than a drop of liquid],\u201d Gill says. \u201cAnd then we thought \u2018Oh, hey, we already have floss. \u2026 Why don\u2019t we just use [floss] to also deposit the vaccines into this location?\u201d",
            "He proposed testing this in mice. But that immediately raised the issue: How do you floss a mouse? No one had ever done that. Rohan Ingrole, a bioengineer at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, accepted the challenge.",
            "That led to even more questions. What\u2019s the best way to open a mouse\u2019s mouth? How does one get the floss in the right spot? And is there a way to protect the mouse\u2019s gums from damage?",
            "Initial tests flopped. While gently moving the floss back and forth over the bottom front teeth (incisors), the animals\u2019 jaws dropped down. Right away, the floss slipped out.",
            "\u201cOne day, after a failed attempt, I was just going around [the lab] and I saw this key chain lying on the table,\u201d Ingrole recalls. \u201cIt made me wonder: Can I use the ring of this key chain to provide support to the mouse jaw?\u201d That, he now says, \u201cturned out to be a game changer.\u201d\u00a0",
            "It worked. Yet even with this support tool, flossing a mouse is a two-person job.",
            "First, the mouse must be lulled into deep sleep with an inhaled anesthetic. Then, one person must gently hold the mouse in an upright position by the scruff of its neck. That person also pops the mouse\u2019s head through the key ring. This allows the animal\u2019s lower jaw to stay open and rest against the ring\u2019s edge. The second person then plays dental hygienist with a vaccine-coated piece of floss.",
            "See how floss can apply a dye (which glows under ultraviolet light) to a mouse\u2019s gum pocket on its right lower incisor. Scientists also made floss coated with different types of vaccines. These can be used to vaccinate mice against disease. One day we may be able to treat ourselves this way.",
            "That floss had been coated with a vaccine made from dead flu viruses or lab-made bits and pieces of them. With each swipe back and forth, that floss delivered the vaccine through the gum\u2019s junctional epithelium.",
            "The team tried four different types of vaccines. All boosted immune defenses in the mice. Eating or drinking right after flossing didn\u2019t affect how well the vaccine worked. What\u2019s more, the flossed vaccine was similar to a vaccine inhaled through the nose.",
            "Giving vaccine with floss may even be a bit safer than a nasal mist. Why? Noses have a direct connection to the brain, Gill notes. So safety tests of nasal vaccines must show there\u2019s no big risk of side effects in the brain. Vaccines given through the gums, by contrast, are unlikely to reach the brain.",
            "Gill and Ingrole\u2019s team shared its new findings July 22 in Nature Biomedical Engineering.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s very clever, I like the strategy,\u201d says Stephanie Langel. She\u2019s a viral immunologist who did not take part in the new work. Langel works at Case Western Reserve University. That\u2019s in Cleveland, Ohio.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Both nasal and floss vaccines triggered immune defenses in the blood of mice. So both vaccines may help prevent severe disease and death. But compared to the floss vaccine, the nasal type caused more antibodies to hang out in mucosal linings (such as those in the nose), the new study found. And that means nasal vaccines might be better at preventing one individual from passing a virus to another, Langel says.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/N6KvqNDErp0?feature=oembed",
            "Here\u2019s why they think this flossing vaccine delivery may work in people too.",
            "The floss vaccine might be improved, however, by adding the right adjuvant (ADD-ju-vunt). This is some chemical or other material that boosts the body\u2019s immune response to some foreign substance. This might help the body make more antibodies in places like the saliva or nose. In turn, that should protect against invading germs.",
            "The floss vaccine has been tested in 27 human volunteers. The researchers coated a one-handed floss pick with a dye. It glows under UV light. Then the volunteers flossed their teeth. Afterward, the researchers used UV light to search for the dye. Flossing had deposited roughly 60 percent of the floss\u2019 vaccine into people\u2019s gum pockets, they found.",
            "Now the goal is to make flossing easier, Gill says, and to ensure that people are getting a consistent dose.",
            "Such vaccines might one day provide a painless, needle-free way to vaccinate, he says. And if people are comfortable with flossing their teeth with a vaccine, they could do it at home.",
            "In fact, self-vaccinations could be huge during a pandemic, Ingrole says. During the COVID-19 pandemic, scores of health-care workers had to help with vaccination efforts. \u201cImagine if you had this vaccine that could just get delivered at your doorstep,\u201d Ingrole says. To get a vaccine, he notes, you\u2019d \u201cno longer have to go stand in line for hours.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0"

            "Even if you somehow became that dense, though, you\u2019d perish long before you could tell the tale. Creating a shrink ray to squeeze other objects down to an extreme density could also be devastating. In Despicable Me, Gru tried to shrink the moon to steal it. \u201cIn real life, if you try to shrink the moon, it would become a black hole and destroy everything,\u201d Rappoccio says.\u00a0",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "Even if Alice, Ms. Frizzle or Ant-Man were somehow able to bypass the laws of physics to survive shrinkage, they would face other problems.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "Shrinking a person\u2019s vocal cords would give them a very high-pitched, and very quiet, voice. And if their mass stayed the same, they would be incredibly heavy for their size. Ant-Man would crush any ant he tried to ride! Puny people might not even be able to see very well. As their eyes shrunk, their ability to process visible wavelengths of light might become worse.",
            "\u201cNone of this is possible,\u201d Kakalios says. But it\u2019s well worth thinking about. \u201cIt\u2019s given me an excuse to talk about real physics that you haven\u2019t noticed. By talking about this superhero ice cream sundae, I sneakily got you to eat your spinach.\u201d\u00a0",
            "Kakalios also notes that the science of making things smaller is not entirely imaginary. Although tech may not be able to shrink people, humans are remarkably adept at shrinking our tech. Without the real-life science of making smaller materials, you wouldn\u2019t be able to read this sentence.\u00a0",
            "Transistors are devices that act as building blocks for your computer, phone and other devices. They allow computers to process information using the numbers \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1.\u201d Electronic machines need a lot of them to work.\u00a0\u00a0",
            "There can be billions of transistors in your phone and in your computer. Each one used to be the size of a person\u2019s fingernail, Kakalios notes. Now, they can be engineered to be even smaller than viruses.\u00a0",
            "This feat of downsizing has given us world-changing modern technologies. And it\u2019s all thanks to the same physics that prevents shrinking technology for people from existing. \u201cThe world is a knowable place,\u201d Kakalios says. \u201cBy figuring out the rules by how the world works, we can then use these rules to make our lives better.\u201d\u00a0",

            "Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar Yaghi (illustrated left to right) picked up the 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry for work on metal-organic frameworks. These molecular structures can be used to trap and/or alter gases, water and more.",
            "Designing a new class of versatile metal-and-carbon molecules has earned three scientists the 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Think of metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs, as honeycombs or cages. Inside are big cavities. Based on how they\u2019re built, MOFs can collect \u2014 and later release \u2014 any of a broad range of useful chemicals, sometimes in huge amounts.",
            "Olof Ramstr\u00f6m is a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. He likened MOFs to Hermione\u2019s charmed handbag in the\u00a0Harry Potter\u00a0series. They\u2019re \u201csmall on the outside but very, very large on the inside,\u201d he noted Oct. 8. It was during an announcement of this year\u2019s award by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.",
            "Some MOFs can pull water from desert air, then later release it for drinking. Others can absorb harmful wavelengths of light so that they won\u2019t injure crop plants. Some MOFs can be filled with a chemical that will break down pollutants that they contact. Engineers are already looking at ways to build such MOFs into clothing as a protective shield against certain toxic chemicals. MOFs can\u00a0capture greenhouse gases like the carbon dioxide\u00a0expelled from many industrial plants. They even can extract forever chemicals known as\u00a0PFAS from water.",
            "The list of what MOFs can do, Ramstr\u00f6m said, just \u201cgoes on and on and on.\u201d",
            "This year\u2019s award \u201chighlights chemistry\u2019s greatest strength \u2014 the ability to design and build molecular structures that address global problems,\u201d says Dorothy J. Phillips. She\u2019s president of the American Chemical Society.",

            "Here\u2019s a quick-minute explanation of the structures behind the 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry.",
            "It all started in the late 1980s. Back then, Richard Robson of the University of Melbourne in Australia figured out that\u00a0combining copper ions with organic \u2014 or carbon-based \u2014 compounds\u00a0created\u00a0a crystal-like molecular structure. It looked similar to that of a diamond.",
            "But this new material was different. Unlike a diamond\u2019s molecules, which pack together densely, Robson\u2019s new structure was full of holes. And those holes would turn out to be very, very useful.\u00a0",
            "A few years later, Susumu Kitagawa of Kyoto University in Japan began creating new MOFs. Eventually, his team found one that could\u00a0take up gases like methane, nitrogen and oxygen.",
            "Around the same time, Omar Yaghi at the University of California, Berkeley, also began combining metal ions and organic molecules. By 1999, he had created a\u00a0highly stable combo. Called MOF-5, it had an enormous surface area. Just a few grams, about the amount in a sugar cube, contained as much surface area as a soccer field.",
            "Such a material could be used to sponge up large amounts of gas, Ramstr\u00f6m notes.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/OIG02qJr9ps?feature=oembed",
            "The 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry went to a trio of scientists who helped develop materials known as metal organic frameworks, or MOFs. In this video, a chemist describes why MOFs are so impressive. He also describes listening in when the new Nobel laureates learned of their win.",
            "Yaghi first heard about his win at an airport. While collecting his luggage, his phone buzzed. The call was from Sweden. \u201cIt was absolutely thrilling,\u201d he said at a news conference. His phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing since, he added.",
            "Yaghi, whose parents were Palestinian refugees, came to the United States from Jordan as a teenager. He credits U.S. public schools for his success. It \u201ctakes people like me with a major disadvantaged background \u2014 a refugee background \u2014 and allows you to \u2026 work hard and distinguish yourself.\u201d",
            "Robson, Kitagawa and Yaghi will share a prize of 11 million Swedish kronor (more than $1.1 million).",

            "Some of the world\u2019s smallest insects, like the featherwing beetle in this microscope image, have wings that look more like combs than membranes.",
            "The wings of many flying insects \u2014 bees, butterflies and dragonflies, for instance \u2014 seem to follow the same blueprint: A solid surface or membrane pushes against the air to keep these animals aloft. But new data show that for the tiniest fliers, there\u2019s a better way: brushes.",
            "The littlest insects are smaller than a grain of rice. Their wings look like tiny bristles or feather dusters, with visible air gaps throughout. It\u2019s a clever adaptation for flying when you\u2019re incredibly small, the new work shows.",
            "Bristled wings are light and surprisingly stiff. They also use less effort to flap than solid wings. This makes it easier for miniature insects to flap quickly and stay airborne \u2014\u00a0 important for moving through air that feels very different at their tiny scale.",
            "And understanding how these unusual wings work could also inspire new technology.",
            "\u201cCurrently, we have robotic insects the size of normal flying insects. But what would be nice is ultra-miniature robots, things you can\u2019t even see,\u201d says Mostafa Nabawy. He works at the University of Manchester in England and had no role in the new research. Bristled wings, this aerospace engineer suspects, might help make such super-mini robots possible.",
            "For more than a decade, Dmitry Kolomenskiy has been part of a team puzzling over why small insects evolved bristled wings. A computational scientist, he works at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology. That\u2019s in Moscow, Russia.",
            "For answers, his team gathered data on 38 species of tiny beetles. Their wings ranged in length from just 0.3 to 5 millimeters (0.01 to 0.2 inch). That\u2019s very small \u2014 from the width of a couple hairs to about the size of a few grains of sand laid end to end. Many of the beetles came from Russia and Vietnam.",
            "Back in the lab, the researchers used microscopes to measure the shape of each wing and count its bristles. And with high-speed cameras, they tracked how fast the beetles\u2019 wings flapped in flight.",
            "To their surprise, the beetles flapped at about the same speed regardless of the wings\u2019 size. That\u2019s unusual, Kolomenskiy says. Among birds and larger insects, smaller wings usually flap faster.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/txPvulerOW4?feature=oembed",
            "This featherwing beetle flaps its bristled wings in a wide stroke. In 2022, Kolomenskiy and other scientists found that bristled wings help these tiny beetles fly very fast. Now, their research shows how the tiny bristles work and how their size and structure changes with a species\u2019 size.",
            "It comes down to how these wings interact with air, Kolomenskiy now concludes. To humans and other large animals, air feels light and breezy. But insects that are just a few millimeters long experience air very differently, he points out. \u201cAt these small scales, they really feel air like a very viscous media,\u201d he explains.",
            "\u201cThink of maple syrup,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get [that] kind of flow for air, if you are very small.\u201d",
            "Fluids, it turns out, behave differently at small scales. Viscous forces now dominate. Here, air doesn\u2019t easily slip through small gaps the way it does at larger scales. Instead, it flows slowly and sticks to surfaces, like syrup clinging to a spoon.",
            "As a result, tiny insects \u201care almost not flying in the air,\u201d says Nabawy, the aerospace engineer. \u201cThey are actually swimming in the air.\u201d",
            "Because the air acts like a thick, syrupy liquid, it doesn\u2019t flow through the gaps in a tiny wing\u2019s bristles. Instead, it gets \u201cstuck\u201d and flows around the bristles.",
            "\u201cVisually, it looks like there\u2019s a lot of void between [the bristles],\u201d says Kolomenskiy. \u201cBut for the [air], it\u2019s not transparent. The flow goes around.\u201d",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The smaller the insect, the stickier the air can feel. So the researchers created a computer model. It analyzed what design would allow these tiny insects to flap with the least effort before their flight performance suffers.",
            "This model looked at how stiff the bristles need to be so they won\u2019t bend. It also tested how widely bristles can be spaced without leaking air.",

            "fCThe body and bristled wing of a tiny insect from the genus Cylindrosella. This is one of the smallest beetles in the world. At about 0.05 millimeter (two thousandths of an inch), it is about half the thickness of a human hair! It lives in mushrooms and probably eats tiny bits of fungus.",
            "Gaps between bristles increased as a wing got smaller, they found. The tiniest wings (0.3 to 0.5 millimeter) had the fewest bristles, and they were spaced farthest apart. Wings with fewer bristles weigh less. That helps these insects flap at high speeds without using much energy, Kolomenskiy observes.",
            "Longer wings \u2014 those more than about 1.7 millimeters \u2014 evolved more bristles and ones that are more closely spaced. As those bristles get very tightly packed, they eventually start to look more like a membrane.",

            "Lastly, the team looked at wing stiffness. Wings that bend too much as they flap don\u2019t push hard enough against the air to generate lift. That\u2019s the force needed to keep things aloft. The computer model showed that both the bristles and what they attach to need enough rigidity to hold the wing\u2019s shape during each flap.",

For instance, swarms of tiny flying robots \u2014 sometimes called \u201crobobees\u201d \u2014 could flit through greenhouses to pollinate crops. Alternatively, squadrons of micro-drones might search collapsed buildings for survivors or monitor things in the environment.",

That second group acts as peacemakers, getting an active immune system to calm down. Three scientists who did pivotal work to understand these peacemakers will take home this year\u2019s 2025 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.",

When they fail at this, the body can develop autoimmune disease or damaging inflammation. Peacemaker cells even help keep the body from rejecting a fetus during pregnancy.",

            "The mutation this pair studied turns off a gene called\u00a0FOXP3.\u00a0Sakaguchi would later show that this gene plays a major role in\u00a0T-reg development. Without a working FOXP3 gene, there will be too few T-regs to halt overly active immune cells and keep them from causing harm.",
            "In 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell showed that mutations in\u00a0this gene are behind IPEX syndrome. It\u2019s an inherited autoimmune disease. Affected people either lack a small group of regulatory T cells or these cells don\u2019t work well. This doesn\u2019t keep the immune system from turning on normally. It will just have trouble turning off. It\u2019s as if the system has no brakes.",
            "Scientists are now learning to harness T-regs. Their goal is to\u00a0keep the body from rejecting transplanted organs\u00a0and to treat other conditions in which the immune system is overactive or directed against the wrong thing. These include other autoimmune disorders,\u00a0food allergies and some cancers.",

They keep pine tree seeds safe and protect them from the freezing temperatures during the winter.",

For instance, when it\u2019s very cold and damp outside. In contrast, when the weather is hot and dry, the seeds will have an easier time finding good soil and growing into trees. In these conditions, the pinecone scales will open, allowing seeds to escape and drift away, to find new ground to grow into new trees.",

            "Made of human hair, it was part of an ancient device used by the Inca. These people once ruled a large empire along the Andes (a mountain range in South America). They had no system of writing. But hundreds of years ago the Inca did use complicated knotted strings \u2014 called khipus (KEE-poos) \u2014 for recordkeeping. And a new analysis now suggests a surprise: These were not merely used by the ancient Inca\u2019s ruling elite.",
            "The Spanish, who defeated the Incas in 1532, wrote that the Inca used khipus to keep records. They might record astronomical events, for instance. Or how many people lived in an area. They might even store data on taxes.",

            "Some kids have a hard time concentrating in class or turning in homework on time. Or they might talk at times when teachers have asked for quiet. Such behaviors may point to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. At least 7 in every 100 children may have this condition. Medicines and behavioral therapy \u2014 a type of talk therapy \u2014 can help treat the symptoms of this disorder. But scientists wanted to know what was behind it. Now, using brain imaging, they have just turned up five areas of the brain linked with symptoms of ADHD. At least two of those regions are smaller in kids with ADHD than in those without the disorder.",
            "More than 80 researchers co-authored the new study. Martine Hoogman at Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, led this massive research team. Her group studied 1,713 people with ADHD and 1,529 others without it. That makes it the largest ADHD study to date. Its participants ranged in age from 4 to 63. They live in 23 places around the world.",
            "The researchers scanned participants\u2019 brains to probe what was going on inside their heads. They used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It relies on magnetic fields and radio waves to picture tissues deep inside the body.",
            "By comparing brain scans of people with and without ADHD, the researchers showed that the volumes of five brain areas were smaller in kids with ADHD. The size of the entire brain also was smaller in this group. But such changes only emerged in children under age 15. No such differences showed up in adults with ADHD.",
            "Hoogman and her colleagues shared their findings online February 15 in Lancet Psychiatry. ",
            "The specific brain areas that differed in size in kids with and without ADHD could help explain some of the disorder\u2019s symptoms. One affected area is the amygdala (Uh-MIG-duh-luh). This tiny structure sits in the brain\u2019s temporal lobes. These are right above the ears. The amygdala is the hot seat for emotions. A smaller amygdala might explain problems of \u201cchildren being easily frustrated, angry or irritable,\u201d says study co-author Philip Asherson. He studies mental disorders such as ADHD at King\u2019s College, London, in England.",
            "The other four affected areas were the caudate (KAW-date), putamen (Pyoo-TAY-mun), accumbens (Uh-KUM-bens) and hippocampus (HIPP-oh-CAMP-us). As Asherson explains, these areas all play a big role in attention. \u201cIf something is very interesting and exciting,\u201d he says, \u201cmost people with ADHD can focus on it. But once the initial interest goes, things start to become a little more boring.\u201d It\u2019s very hard for kids with ADHD to stay focused on things that they do not find stimulating, he says.",
            "What might explain the size differences in these brain regions? Affected children might have had delays in brain development as they were growing, the authors speculate. What\u2019s clear, they say, is that the drugs given to treat ADHD did not cause these changes. Children who had taken these drugs had similar reductions in brain volumes as those who hadn\u2019t taken the drugs.",
            "Jeffrey Halperin studies ADHD at Queens College in New York City. It\u2019s part of the City University of New York. He praised the study for recruiting so many participants. Still, its findings won\u2019t change the way that clinics treat people with ADHD today. However, he does think doctors \u201cmay become more attuned to emotional problems\u201d in their patients now that they know that the amygdala plays a role in ADHD.",
            "In this study, the brains were scanned just once. Halperin would like to see the scans repeated. Doing several scans over many years would provide much more information about brain development in kids with ADHD, he explains."

For example, when working on a project you enjoy \u2014 such as drawing or solving a puzzle \u2014 your brain releases dopamine. And this motivates you to keep going. This chemical focuses our attention on the current task and helps us organize our thoughts. It even plays a role in how we plan the steps we must take to finish a job.",

And this can lead people to do more and more of the activity that causes the brain to release this feel-good chemical. If a person begins to neglect school, friends or other important parts of their life to carry out a dopamine-triggering activity, addiction may develop.",

That\u2019s why some diseases involving low dopamine affect people\u2019s ability to move. Parkinson\u2019s disease is one example. Scientists have linked this disease to a loss of cells in the brain that release dopamine. With this understanding, they can work on finding ways to replace the dopamine loss and help people manage their symptoms.",

            "Peeling the tape slowly, at 12.5 centimeters (5 inches) per second, created a small electric field. But when the motor sped up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) per second, the space where the tape left the roll became very highly charged. Zhang\u2019s group tallied a billion volts per meter across this tiny space!",
            "That\u2019s an astonishing voltage \u2014 far beyond what\u2019s usually achieved in the lab, Zare points out. (For perspective, lightning shoots from a storm cloud when the voltage is 3 million volts per meter. In the tape experiment, the high voltage is across too small of a space for the micro-lightning to hurt us.)",
            "The peeling tape\u2019s zap illustrates the triboelectric effect. This is the generation of an electric charge as materials come into contact and then separate. It\u2019s like static electricity, when two objects are rubbed together then moved apart. One object becomes positively charged, meaning it loses electrons. The other gains those lost electrons and becomes negatively charged. (This can make a negatively charged balloon repel electrons from a wall, then \u201cstick\u201d to the positively charged surface. Or, it can send out a tiny zap of electricity.)",
            "The triboelectric effect is at work all around us \u2014 in things as simple as a sliding raindrop and the rustle of our clothes. But the tape experiment created a much higher voltage than most other everyday triboelectric events. Why? Being sticky, the tape peeled off the roll in a jerky way. Scientists call this a \u201cstick\u2013slip\u201d event. It leads to higher charges than when things just rub together or touch.",
            "A high electric field emerged only when the tape was pulled quickly, Zare says. If that electric field is high enough, electrons from the tape will speed up and smash into air molecules or other molecules in the tape. This \u201cleads to a spark that drives chemical reactions,\u201d says Zare. Those electrons flowing between the tape\u2019s surfaces can create a high enough voltage around the tape to break down molecules in the air, he says \u2014 turning them into ions.",
            "Zare\u2019s team repeated what Zhang\u2019s team had done. This time, they also looked to see if molecules of water vapor in the air near the tape would break up and form into new molecules. They did.",
            "Next, Zare\u2019s group put chemicals they suspected would react as vapors in the electric field next to the peeling tape. This was to test a common reaction used in industrial chemistry. (It\u2019s one where pyridine and methyl iodide are reacted to form something new.) Right away, Zare\u2019s group detected new products as these chemicals now reacted.",

There is a lot to discover about what\u2019s happening at the tiny space where the peeling tape first makes contact with the air, he says.",
            "Daniel Lacks agrees. This chemical engineer works at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cPeople don\u2019t usually look at what\u2019s happening in that little, teeny distance\u201d between two nearly touching surfaces, he says. His own work has focused on particles that pick up an electric charge after rubbing against each other.\u00a0",
            "Lacks finds it \u201cvery cool\u201d that the electric fields created by tape get so high they can drive chemical reactions.",

            "Simone Ciampi works with triboelectric effects at Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia. What surprised him was the beauty and simplicity of the new experiment.",
            "Guiding chemical reactions with triboelectricity is one type of green chemistry, Ciampi notes. Here, electricity can do work typically done by chemicals that may be toxic. So this approach, he concludes, can be more environmentally friendly.",
            "Chemicals often react through a series of steps. Some may require separating positive and negative charges within a molecule. By controlling those electric charges, you can manage the reaction\u2019s steps to help choose what product you end up with, Ciampi explains.",
            "Indeed, a huge number of chemical reactions are sensitive to electric fields. But there\u2019s often a challenge in using an electric field to guide reactions. The problem, Ciampi says, is the electrically conducting materials used to make the field. Those materials can interfere with the reacting chemicals, which could prevent the desired results.",
            "That\u2019s why Ciampi is excited about this new research. It shows how a material that\u2019s not electrically conductive, such as tape, can create an electric field \u2014 and drive reactions without interfering with them. This, he says, could open \u201can entirely new space in chemistry.\u201d",

            "What do viruses sound like? Scientists recently found out. They developed a way to eavesdrop on these and other microbes. This new tech can help scientists study such microbes and sound out the identity of germs in our environment.",
            "For hundreds of years, we\u2019ve been able to see cells through microscopes. As these spyglasses have gotten more powerful, they\u2019ve been able to zoom in on smaller and smaller details. Yet even when you can see individual microbes, most look pretty similar.",

Different things will make distinctive sounds, depending on their shape and what they\u2019re made of. This is why knocking on a table sounds different from tapping on a window.",
            "The same is true for microbes. Each type has its own special makeup of proteins and other molecules. Their unique chemistry and structures give each microbe a characteristic sound.",
            "That\u2019s what led Harel and his MSU team to begin working on their new laser-based system. By figuring out how to measure these sounds, they\u2019re now able to catalog them. It\u2019s much like seeing a distant bird in the woods but not being sure what type of bird it is until you learn its distinctive call.",

So to \u201cincrease our understanding and build a database,\u201d Harel says, \u201cwe\u2019ll have to do a lot of experiments on different viruses in different environments.\u201d",
            "Another issue: Many microbes belong to species with lots of related members \u2014 strains that you might think of like siblings. Consider E. coli. These bacteria live almost everywhere. Although most are harmless to people, a few strains can cause serious disease. Since all E. coli have nearly the same shape and are made of nearly the same proteins, it might be hard to hear a difference between harmful and harmless ones.",
            "To find out, scientists will have to just keep listening. Once they have a robust library of sounds, they may be able to tell most microbes apart. That because microbial sounds are very specific, Harel says. It\u2019s like listening for a friend\u2019s voice in a loud place. Because their voice is familiar, you can pick it out from the other noises.",
            "There\u2019s plenty of research left to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s a new way of looking at biology,\u201d Harel explains. For now, he says, \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to see because very few people have ever looked.\u201d",
            "But one day, this type of tech might prove useful beyond the lab. For instance, it could be used in sensors installed at airports and other crowded places. These could then listen for worrisome microbes \u2014 and send out warnings of which ones (and how many) are out there.",

            "Some people see a pickleball and want to smash it. When Anchal Sareen saw some pickleballs lying around a lab a few years ago, she thought about submarines and airplanes. As a mechanical engineer who studies how fluids affect movement, she couldn\u2019t help it. So she went right out, bought a balloon and wrapped it around the pickleball. It became the inspiration for a new surface to speed and steer aircrafts and underwater drones.",
            "The surface has dimples, like a golf ball. But they\u2019re adjustable. Add air and the dimples smooth out. Remove air and the dimples deepen.",
            "In a pair of recent papers, Sareen and her team at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor have now shown how dimple depth can alter drag. Drag is the friction-like force that slows things down as they travel through a fluid. They\u2019ve also shown how changing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the dimples can help steer an object through air, water or other fluids.",
            "\u201cThat\u2019s a cool idea,\u201d says Christopher Douglas at Duke University in Durham, N.C. Drag is a big challenge, he says. \u201cAnything you can do to minimize drag is great,\u201d says this mechanical engineer who did not work on the new skin.",

            "Douglas studies fluid flow as a way to improve the systems that propel vehicles. Engineers, he notes, have long been altering surface roughness to reduce drag.",
            "But drag isn\u2019t always a bad thing, he adds.",
            "Fins and rudders guide a ship by increasing drag in one place more than in another. This nudges a ship in a desired direction. And dimples might help here, too, says Sareen. She envisions vehicles that might steer by altering the texture of their skin. This could be in addition to \u2014 or even instead of \u2014 fins and rudders.",
            "Sareen studies how to control the flow of fluids around objects to achieve a certain goal, like a reduction in drag.",
            "For inspiration, she has looked to animals. Some swimmers, she says, change the texture of their skin to change how water flows around them. One of her favorites is the shortfin mako shark. \u201cThey\u2019re the fastest sharks in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re like the cheetahs of the ocean.\u201d A shortfin mako shark can swim about 50 kilometers (30 miles) per hour, with even faster bursts.",
            "Engineers suspect this shark\u2019s skin is its secret to speed. It is covered with tiny toothlike scales called denticles. These denticles can change in an instant. When the shark is cruising, they all lie almost flat against its body. This can reduce its drag by about 10 percent. When the shark takes sharp turns or bends its body to navigate, the denticles move \u2014 but only on some parts of its body.",
            "\u201cThey actually bristle, which means they lift up,\u201d Sareen says. Denticles can lift out by as much as 50 degrees. That changes the skin\u2019s drag and the flow of water around it. This helps the shark make quick turns. It\u2019s also efficient because the fish doesn\u2019t need to move a muscle.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "Sareen had long been interested in applying that idea to new vehicles. Could you change their surface to affect their movement? And that\u2019s where the balloon-covered pickleball comes in.",
            "She showed one to a student interested in how dimples affect golf ball flight. Then she challenged him to study the link between dimples and drag.",
            "The student and other researchers 3-D printed model spheres with different-sized dimples. They looked like giant golf balls.",
            "They tested these plastic models in wind tunnels to identify how dimple depth affected drag.",
            "Next, they printed hard spheres with holes. These looked like pickleballs, only larger. The researchers jacketed these holey spheres with a stretchy material. Then they attached the covered spheres to a vacuum pump. Sucking air out with the vacuum made the dimples deeper. Allowing air to flow back in made them shallower.",
            "Making the first version of this morphable skin took about two years. It wasn\u2019t easy, Sareen recalls. First, they had to very precisely control dimple depth with that pump. Their wind-tunnel experiments had shown that changing dimple depth by just 0.1 millimeter (0.004 inch) could reduce drag on the ball by 50 percent.",
            "\u201cIt was very sensitive,\u201d she says. All the air going in or out had to be controlled precisely. And that outer skin had to be made from the right material \u2014 and \u201cabsolutely leakproof,\u201d she adds.",
            "But those years of tests paid off.",
            "The wind-tunnel data showed that the dimples could produce lift. That\u2019s a force that raises a vehicle and changes its direction.",
            "By changing the arrangement of dimples, Sareen\u2019s team could not only control a ball\u2019s lift but also the trajectory of its travel. That prompted them to investigate how dimples might be used as a sort of steering wheel.",
            "\u201cWe are improving on that design as we speak,\u201d she says. The researchers are now working on version 3.0.",
            "iFhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/De2VQYkdztM?feature=oembed",
            "Anchal Sareen and her team explain how they used soft robotic technology to develop dynamic surface dimples \u2014 ones that can change at different flow speeds \u2014 to cut the drag experienced by underwater vehicles. It should also allow them to maneuver without fins and rudders.",
            "They\u2019re also developing tests to see if the design would work in real-world conditions, such as the skin of some vessel sailing through air or water.",
            "This is a critical next step. \u201cThere are many different ways to control a system,\u201d says Douglas, at Duke. A wind tunnel is a controlled environment, he notes. In the open air or water, the effects of a dimpled skin may be more difficult to predict.",
            "\u201cThe device or technology which could develop out of this work would be a bit more complicated than the work they\u2019ve done in the lab,\u201d Douglas suspects. For instance, dimpled skin could cause a vehicle to rotate. And that could make it harder to steer.",
            "Over the next few years, Sareen\u2019s group plans to test new prototypes in the air and water. But their inventions won\u2019t be found on fairways, greens and sand traps.",
            "\u201dA lot of people have asked me, \u2018Are you planning to patent this as a golf ball which can stay in the air?'\u201d Sareen laughs and says: Not any time soon."

And it can be a truly impressive spectacle.",
            "Hail forms high in the clouds during a storm. There, some raindrops freeze solid. As more and more raindrops collide, an icy \u201cstone\u201d grows in size until it\u2019s too heavy to remain aloft.",

But such looping motions are actually rare, scientists in China have now shown. They analyzed hailstones collected by citizen scientists.",
            "Since 2016, people had been collecting hailstones across 15 provinces in China. These citizen scientists gathered more than 3,000 of these bits of ice and stored them until people on Qinghong Zhang\u2019s team could retrieve the hail.

The researchers then analyzed the specific isotopes of oxygen present in the frozen water within each layer. By matching that chemistry with the properties of the atmosphere at different heights, they could estimate the paths each ice ball had taken through the sky.",

            "Mice usually need an immediate reward or punishment to learn something, notes neuroscientist Richard Palmiter. He works at the University of Washington in Seattle. Even one minute\u2019s delay between cause (say, pulling a lever) and effect (getting a treat) can be too long for mice to learn the two are related.",
            "Not so for food poisoning. Even a rodent\u2019s brain has no trouble linking a tummy torment now with something it ate quite a while earlier.",
            "That makes food poisoning one of the best ways to study how our brains connect events that are separated in time, Palmiter says.",
            "So researchers asked: How does the brain learn to hate foods that made us sick? After five years of experiments, Zimmerman\u2019s team now shows that effects in the brain can burn dangerous tastes into memory.",
            "They described the details in the June 19 issue of Nature.",
            "Submit your question here, and we might answer it an upcoming issue of\u00a0Science News Explores",
            "A small, almond-shaped brain region called the amygdala links emotions to memories, learning and our senses. So it\u2019s not surprising that this region plays a role in deciding what flavors we find gross or not.",
            "Palmiter\u2019s group had shown that the gut tells the brain when it\u2019s feeling icky. How? It activates certain \u201calarm\u201d neurons called CGRP cells. \u201cThey respond to everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d Palmiter explains.",
            "To study how alarm neurons link food poisoning to food repulsion, Zimmerman\u2019s team at Princeton had mice drink grape Kool-Aid. A half-hour later, they injected the animals with lithium chloride. This made them ill. Two days later, they again gave the mice grape Kool-Aid.",
            "The team ran versions of this simple experiment again and again. And at each step, they peeked inside the brains of those mice to see what was happening.",
            "When the mice had first gotten sick after drinking grape Kool-Aid, their alarm neurons turned on. This event increased the sensitivity of amygdala cells that carried memories of the grape flavor.",
            "Those same amygdala cells also turned on when the mice encountered grape Kool-Aid again. This suggests alarm neurons had helped the amygdala remember foods that seemed dangerous.",
            "This effect didn\u2019t show up in mice that had tasted grape Kool-Aid before without getting sick.",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "The novelty that cues humans to remember food poisoning could rely on a bit more than just taste. Many unusual aspects of an eating experience can ick us out. It could be some spice blend. Or we may not like smells or other things that we pick up on in a restaurant that\u2019s new to us.",
            "The new study was largely motivated by \u201cpure curiosity,\u201d says Ilana Witten at Princeton. She\u2019s a coauthor of the study. And her team\u2019s findings might go beyond food poisoning, she now suspects. They might be \u201cvery relevant to mental health.\u201d",
            "Similar nerve pathways likely explain why unusual and bad experiences become so memorable, she says. But this event-triggered repulsion \u2014 known as aversive learning \u2014 sometimes goes wrong in people who have suffered a trauma or who have developed some addiction.",
            "The brain wiring that\u2019s supposed to keep us safe can now end up causing harm. Learning to control those circuits, she says, might point to new treatments."

            "\u201cThat really made us want to know what drives that extra sugar intake,\u201d she recalls. So Min\u00e8re\u2019s team designed another experiment with two groups of mice.",

            "In the morning, the researchers offered both groups of mice sugar. And all devoured it \u2014 even those that had just eaten. This confirmed that even when full, mice crave sugar.",
            "Min\u00e8re\u2019s team devised a way to explore which parts of the brain might explain this.",
            "They inserted special proteins into a few parts of the animals\u2019 brains. These proteins glow when brain cells are active. To detect that glow, the scientists also implanted a light-recording device into each mouse\u2019s brain.",
            "The researchers focused on a bundle of neurons called the POMC. It sits in a part of the brain that controls hunger, known as the hypothalamus. These cells are known to make mice \u2014 and people \u2014 feel full. The team wondered if the same cells might help drive sugar cravings.",
            "When an animal eats, POMC neurons kick off a cascade of activity. They send messages to other groups of brain cells that give a sense of feeling full. That feeling tells the animal to stop eating.",
            "When the mice were offered sugar, though, a different pathway out of the POMC lit up. \u201cWe found that the POMC neurons, which tell us how full we are, are also quickly turned on when [mice] see signs of sugar,\u201d says Min\u00e8re.",
            "This pathway, she believes, acts as a sugar-craving circuit. It can override the fullness circuit. The sugar-craving circuit engages a part of the brain that signals rewards and pleasure. This, the researchers think, is what makes sweets so appealing \u2014 even when we\u2019re full.",
            "At least, that\u2019s the case in mouse brains. But what about in us?",
            "iFhttps://www.sciencenews.org/conversion/zephr-iframe-test",
            "To test if people have the same sugar-craving brain circuit they saw in mice, Min\u00e8re\u2019s team designed two experiments.",
            "First, they looked to see if people possess the same neural links. So, they analyzed slices of human brain tissue. They looked at the same sites where they had seen this in mice. POMC neurons in people, they found, form the same paths that they do in mice.",
            "Next, they looked to see if those pathways in us respond to sugar, too.",
            "Volunteers agreed to lay in a brain scanner called a functional MRI machine, or fMRI. It recorded brain activity as people got water or sugar. When it was sugar, cells in their sugar-craving circuit lit up. This suggested those cells work much as they do in mice.",
            "Our brains differ quite a bit from mouse brains. Still, these particular parts of the brain are very similar in both, notes Sabrina Diano. She\u2019s a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York City who did not take part in the study.

            "Min\u00e8re believes there\u2019s a reason brain why our brains crave sugar, even when we\u2019re full. Our ancient ancestors evolved in a time when it was tougher to find food, she says. And sweet foods typically provide lots of quick energy.",
