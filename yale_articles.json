            "Trees and forests are often seen as symbolic of nature, and for good reason: They are vitally important to both the planet and to people. More than three-quarters of the world\u2019s terrestrial biodiversity occurs in forests. Wooded areas filter and manage rainwater, provide shade, soak up pollution, regulate climate, provide oxygen, and salve our spirits.",
            "In the face of threats from deforestation, ecosystem degradation, pests, and more, about 38 percent of the planet\u2019s 166,000 tree species are now at risk of extinction, according to an October assessment from the IUCN. Increasing the planet\u2019s tree coverage would have positive benefits for the climate and our ecosystems, scientists agree, but how we go about that is complicated.\n",
            "In an interview with Yale Environment 360, Jake M. Robinson, a researcher in restoration genomics at Flinders University, in Adelaide, South Australia, talked about how reforestation efforts can go awry if done poorly, reducing biodiversity and harming local populations.\n",
            "\u201cIf you plant trees in ecosystems where trees simply shouldn\u2019t be growing, you can remove the biodiversity that evolved with those niches,\u201d said Robinson, author of the recently published Treewilding: Our Past, Present and Future Relationship with Forests. \u201cTree planting campaigns are important, but it\u2019s more important that we do it right.\u201d\n",

            "Yale Environment 360: How has the planet\u2019s tree cover changed since humanity started to transition to agricultural societies some 10,000 years ago?",
            "Jake M. Robinson: Back then, something like 45 to 60 percent of the terrestrial surface of Earth was covered in forests. It has rapidly changed. We have gone from about 6 billion hectares of forest to 4 billion. We have lost a third of the planet\u2019s forests in the last 10,000 years. About 50 percent of that loss has been just in the last 100 years or so. That\u2019s how much it\u2019s sped up since the Industrial Revolution. But the nature of forests is changing too. There are pockets of natural virgin forests left, but much of it is monoculture plantation.",
            "e360: Is there a consensus about how much of the planet should be forested for a healthy planet?",
            "Robinson: No, there isn\u2019t a consensus. Some people have the idea that we should be restoring ecosystems back to what they were like before humans started intervening in them. Another view is we need to restore the functions and the processes of ecosystems and the biodiversity they support, not necessarily this ideal picture of what it was a few thousand years ago. I would like to see us recognize that humans are part of the ecosystem and that it\u2019s okay that we\u2019re altering the land: Indigenous peoples have been changing ecosystems for tens of thousands of years.\n",
            "e360: Tree-planting initiatives have really taken off. You write that, globally, the area of planted forests rose from 170\u2009million hectares in 1990 to 293\u2009million hectares in 2020. How did that happen?\n",
            "Robinson: This was partly catalyzed by a 2019 Science study, which is quite controversial in the restoration ecology sector. They basically ran some models and showed that 900 million hectares is available to support forests, which could host about another a trillion trees. That simple idea took off, stratospherically. The authors weren\u2019t literally advocating planting a trillion trees, nor did they mean to imply that there aren\u2019t other essential ecosystems, like grasslands. It was all in good faith, and mostly a case of poor communication.",
            "BQ\u201cRestoration seems like a fairly straightforward idea\u2026 but probably the majority of ecosystem restoration projects fail.\u201d      ",
            "e360: What\u2019s wrong with the \u201cplant a trillion trees\u201d mindset?",
            "Robinson: Restoration seems like a fairly straightforward idea, but it often goes wrong. In urban areas, around 30 percent of trees that are planted die within the first five years of life. If you plant trees in ecosystems where trees simply shouldn\u2019t be growing, you can remove the biodiversity that evolved with those niches. Probably the majority of ecosystem restoration projects fail or don\u2019t meet their stated goals. There\u2019s a big social element as well, because lots of people are already on the land that is put aside for tree planting; you can end up displacing them. Tree planting campaigns are important, but it\u2019s more important that we do it right, planting the right trees in the right places.\n",
            "e360: Is there a key example of a tree planting project that has been thoughtful and successful?\n",
            "Robinson: There\u2019s one that I like to draw attention to in Oaxaca, Mexico. Several hundred years ago there were 100,000 Indigenous people supported by the forests in the Coixtlahuaca district, and now there\u2019s fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. The land can\u2019t support them, it\u2019s so degraded from agriculture and poor land management. Twenty years ago the soil was essentially rock. The local communities had to crush the rock so it could retain water, and then they planted these little nurse species \u2014 a non-native tree called Gregg\u2019s pines that\u2019s well adapted to poor conditions and won\u2019t reproduce \u2014 just to kickstart the ecosystem. These trees died and their carbon made it into the soil. It\u2019s an ongoing project \u2014 it\u2019s not yet a flourishing ecosystem \u2014 but it just shows that it can start from zero.",

            "e360: In other projects, people are very firmly in favor of using only native species.\n",
            "Robinson: Yes. In Japan there\u2019s a technique called the Miyawaki Method. The idea is to plant a carefully selected mix of native species in very high densities, which stimulates them to grow faster. It\u2019s essentially a rapid way of creating a functional ecosystem. But because this high density is artificial, it\u2019s controversial. Many ecologists aren\u2019t fans. But I\u2019d say that most of the time, they\u2019re in urban areas where the ecosystem\u2019s just so different and novel anyway, and they have social benefits as well.",

            "Robinson: That was [English forester] Richard St. Barbe Baker\u2019s idea, to help stop desertification. It could be a good idea, but you\u2019ve got to do it right. I think they\u2019re planting some trees where they really shouldn\u2019t be, and there are some human rights issues, potentially, as well.\n",
            "e360: You talk about the concept of \u201cgrowing\u201d as opposed to \u201cplanting\u201d trees. What\u2019s the difference, and why is it meaningful?\n",
            "Robinson: Sometimes you can leave a spot and let nature do its thing; nature will find a way and grow. But in certain situations, because we have degraded the planet so much, you have to create the right conditions for these trees and nourish them. That\u2019s one of the challenges we\u2019re trying to work with now: how to nurture at scale.",
            "BQ\u201cWe can tell the difference between a degraded ecosystem and a restored ecosystem simply by listening to it.\u201d",

            "Robinson: This is a huge issue. I don\u2019t use the term revolution lightly, but I think we need a revolution in our food systems, because agriculture is one of the leading causes of ecosystem degradation on the planet, if not the leading cause.\n",
            "One solution I speak about in the book is \u201csyntropic agroforestry.\u201d This is just the idea that you can still have a flourishing forest ecosystem while producing food within it. You have to really understand the lifecycle of the trees and know how to layer the plants and how communities turn over with time. Klaus Lotz, a farmer in New Zealand, is doing this. It looks quite like a rainforest. He mostly focuses on non-annual plants \u2014 fruits and vegetables, nuts and mushrooms. He says his yield per species is 10 percent lower per area of land than in a monocultural system, but his overall yield, of all produce, is actually higher.",
            "e360: You are a microbiologist by training. How important are microbes within a forest?\n",
            "Robinson: Incredibly important. And it\u2019s not thought about enough. In a five-ton tree trunk, there\u2019s around a trillion bacteria; and more in the leaves, the seeds, the roots, flowers, et cetera. A tree is between 68.75 and 99.9 percent microbial, according to my calculations. That\u2019s kind of mind-blowing, isn\u2019t it? Trees are holobionts [assemblages of a host and the many microbial species living in or around them]. Much like we now recognize the importance of the gut microbiome in human health, we need to recognize the importance of microbes for forest health.",

            "e360: Are forest stewards harnessing the power of microbes?",
            "Robinson: Sometimes. Microbial inoculants are becoming more popular. The idea is to create your own liquid culture of microbes that you spray on leaves or put in the soil [to enhance soil fertility and plant growth], or you can include it with the little plugs of saplings if you are tree planting.\n",
            "e360: You also study soil acoustics; how can that help to support forest soil health?\n",
            "Robinson: We created these little modified microphones that we place in the soil, that detect the critters moving around: the earth worms, the spiders, the ants, millipedes, et cetera. We can tell the difference between a degraded ecosystem and a restored ecosystem simply by listening to it, like a doctor using a stethoscope to listen to your heartbeat. It\u2019s been quite eye-opening, and I think it\u2019ll be a useful monitoring tool in the future. We\u2019ve also recently found that white noise can stimulate fungi, promoting growth. We need to figure out the evolutionary drivers of this \u2014 why are they responding? It could be they \u2018mistake\u2019 it for the sound of rain falling, which could trigger movement.\n",

            "Robinson: It\u2019s having different effects on different forests across the world. While lots of them are reducing their range, some forests are actually expanding. Along the 12,000-kilometer-long northern tree line [where forests give way to tundra], most of it\u2019s expanding and only a tiny bit is receding.\n",
            "e360: What do you think of helping trees migrate into new climate-friendly zones?\n",
            "Robinson: I\u2019m working on \u201cclimate-adjusted provenancing\u201d in South Australia. We\u2019re essentially collecting seeds from a climate gradient going north, where the conditions are warmer already, and then seeing if seeds from further afield fare better in changing conditions than the local tree seeds. I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on it yet because it\u2019s at an experimental phase in our lab.\n",
            "e360: Overall, do you think humanity is moving in the right direction to restore our planet\u2019s forested lands?\n",

            "In the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton, meteorologists have faced an unprecedented wave of threats and harassment, according to James Marshall Shepherd, a former NASA weather scientist who is currently director of the University of Georgia\u2019s atmospheric sciences program. Some have received messages stating that scientists should be killed; others have been cursed and told to shut up. Social media posts have also targeted FEMA workers, suggesting they should be beaten, arrested, shot, or hung on sight.",

But he acknowledges that not everyone will be receptive: Trust in science and scientists is, in some communities, at an all time low.

The tone and volume of the harassment picked up quite a bit during these most recent two hurricanes. Now, some of that is, I think, just related to the fact that we\u2019re in an election year. Back in 2012, I remember some similar claims that people were making about Superstorm Sandy, that the government was creating it to disrupt the election.

But to then throw on top of that harassment and skepticism. James Spann, a very well-known TV meteorologist in Birmingham, Alabama, said, \u201cYou\u2019re working with two to three hours of sleep for multiple weeks under a high-stress situation, and then you deal with these threats that come in, it\u2019ll beat you down.\u201d",

            "Schmidt says that scientists still can\u2019t explain the unexpected spike in temperatures. When I talked with him recently, he called the continuing confusion \u201ca little embarrassing\u201d for researchers.",

            "Scientists have identified several recent developments that could have contributed to the last year and a half of anomalous warmth. The first is a set of rules that reduced the sulfur content of the fuel used in super tankers. Since sulfur dioxide pollution reflects sunlight, this change, while good for public health, could have led to increased ocean heating. ",
            "A second potential contributor is an unusual eruption that occurred in January 2022. Normally, volcanoes emit sulfur dioxide and so produce temporary cooling. But the eruption of Hunga Tonga\u2013Hunga Ha\u2018apai, an underwater volcano in the South Pacific, sent water vapor shooting into the stratosphere, which could have had a warming effect.",
            "Yet another possible contributor is the solar cycle. The sun is currently at, or near, a peak of activity, and this, too, could be boosting temperatures.",
            "At this point, though, Schmidt says, none of these developments \u2014 or even a combination of all of them \u2014 seems sufficient to explain the heat. This, in turn, raises several other possibilities. The recent temperature run-up could be the result of some development that\u2019s yet to be identified. Or it could mean the climate system is more unpredictable than was thought. Alternatively, it could indicate that something is missing from climate models, or that amplifying feedbacks are kicking in sooner than the models had predicted.\n",

We expected that 2023 would be another warm year because all of the years are warm now, but it probably wasn\u2019t going to be a record-warm year. So when the records started to be broken, first in the North Atlantic in March and April, June, and then the global mean in June, and then throughout the rest of the year, and then absolutely ridiculously large record-breaking events in the fall \u2014 August, September, October, November \u2014 people started using adjectives that scientists don\u2019t generally tend to use.",
            "At the end of 2023, we summed it up: It was a record warm year and it was a record-breaking size of the record. Our eyebrows at this point were rolling over the top of our heads. It was clear that the predictions that people had made at the beginning of year were all wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter what the method was, they were all wrong, and they were all wrong by about 0.2 degrees Celsius. Now that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but it\u2019s a big deal. ",
            "You can accommodate a missed prediction in two ways. You can either say, your actual prediction was wrong. Or you can say, no, we underestimated the uncertainty.\n",
            "So at the beginning of 2024, we thought: Hopefully we\u2019ll get some more information from people doing science for all the different things that were happening. And maybe we\u2019ll get some more analyses of the internal variability. Some of that has happened, but not in a coordinated way. And it\u2019s still pretty much, I would say, amateur hour in terms of assessing what actually happened in 2023.",

It put a lot of water vapor into the stratosphere, which is normally super dry. That was a very new thing, and people were saying, well, maybe that\u2019s contributing.",
            "People were also talking about unusual behavior of the Saharan dust or the wind pattern in the North Atlantic. People were talking about long-term, ongoing changes in how much pollution is coming from China and India. Maybe those things are changing faster than we anticipated. The pollution in the air is a cooling factor, and so if you take it away, then that\u2019s a warming factor.",
            "The science that\u2019s been done has not been equally spread amongst all of those things. A lot of people have looked at the impact of the marine shipping regulation change. If you take that and you put it into some climate model and you estimate the temperature change, right now you\u2019d expect about 0.05 of a degree, 0.08 of a degree [of warming per year], and then building over a decade to about 0.1 degree. So that seems like it helps, but it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s sufficient. And the first paper that came out about the volcano, they said, no, no, the normal cooling volcanic pollution is still bigger than the warming water vapor component. So now I have more warming to explain and less things to explain it.\n",

            "Schmidt: Like I said, there\u2019s two reasons why you could have messed up the prediction. One is you are missing some driving element. Another is you are underestimating the spread. Things are behaving in a more erratic way than we expected, and that means the future predictions may also be more off. And you could think of things being more off in multiple ways because the system is changing in a way where what happened in the past is no longer a good guide to what\u2019s going to happen in the future.

And so my best plan is just to do the best that we can in terms of the science and hope that by knowing more about the system, people will make better choices.

            "Here in Burnt Corn Valley, smack in the middle of the Navajo reservation\u2019s vast Black Mesa region, the hilly land both craves water and is brutalized by it. The sandy Arizona soil cracks under a punishing August sun as red-striped blister beetles search for moisture across its baked surface. Cottonwood trees and sagebrush rise from deep gullies carved by floodwaters that, during the intensifying summer monsoon, sluice off surrounding mesas and wash away fragile topsoil \u2014 reminders that with climate change, even quenching rains harbor powers of destruction.",
            "This portrait of climatic havoc belies a softer reality, though. Farming once thrived in this parched region and could once again \u2014 if the right practices are adopted. Exhibit A: The crops on Roberto Nutlouis\u2019s 12-acre Sliding Rock Farm, in his reservation hometown of Pi\u00f1on, a five-hour drive north of Phoenix. \u201cThe corn is actually pretty big and thriving,\u201d Nutlouis says. He believes \u2014 and both Western science and the lived experience of his Native elders affirm \u2014 that the traditional rock and stick structures he\u2019s built on his property, which help store water and prevent erosion, have a lot to do with it. These structures, similar to those used by Native peoples long before Europeans arrived on the continent, are not only delivering water to crops (the broader, 27,000-square-mile reservation has the highest reported rate of food insecurity in the U.S.). They are also restoring Nutlouis\u2019s watershed and those of his neighbors, helping to sequester carbon, and reviving this high-desert ecosystem. It\u2019s all part of a bigger effort among a range of local and regional grassroots organizations to build back the reservation\u2019s fragile, depleted ecosystems and bring greater sovereignty over food, water, and health to its communities.\n",
            "BQPeople living in arid zones have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture water for crops.",
            "Din\u00e9 (the Navajo name for themselves) are well aware that climate change is making the weather on their semi-arid plateau weirder, wilder, and more destructive. Depending on elevation, precipitation in Black Mesa averages 6 to 16 inches a year; recent heat extremes \u2014 the Navajo government declared a state of emergency in 2023 due to soaring temperatures \u2014mean that the scant water evaporates more quickly. Climate models predict the region will experience increasing droughts that decimate plant life, part of a growing trend of human-caused desertification across the globe, as well as higher-intensity seasonal rainfall, which can sweep away crops and roads. The ecological health of the reservation has also been weakened by deforestation from timbering operations and from overgrazing over the years.",
            "Still, this season, Nutlouis, 44, has been able to skip his usual two-hour roundtrip drive to a reliable well to haul water home for his corn. His crop is healthy and hydrated because his land still holds last winter\u2019s snowmelt. Clearly, his heavy labor over the past 20 years \u2014 during which he has built woven brush dams, gabions (wirework cages filled with rocks), earthen berms, concrete spillways and trenches, limestone aprons and walls, and stone-lined \u201cZuni bowls,\u201d which stabilize eroding streambeds \u2014 is paying off.",

            "Din\u00e9 and others living in arid zones around the world have long used structures made of naturally occurring materials to capture and control water to grow crops and to mitigate the devastation of floods in ephemeral stream systems. Various Puebloans, including Zuni and Hohokam, used similar devices, as did the Aztecs. Arab peoples and tribes in India have incorporated stone water diversions for thousands of years. \u201c[M]ost traditional Indigenous communities are not passive observers of nature,\u201d writes Lyla June Johnston, a Din\u00e9 anthropologist and community organizer. Instead, they are \u201cinfluential facilitators of landscape scale abundance, rooted in an ethic of kinship and reverence.\u201d",
            "Time and again over the last 15 years, Laura Norman, a research scientist with the U.S. Geological Survey, has seen evidence that when these structures \u2014 which Norman calls Natural Infrastructure in Dryland Streams, or NIDS \u2014 are placed in gullies, they slow water to mitigate erosion, collect nutrient-rich sediment and plant debris that nourish both crops and wild plants, help store carbon, improve groundwater recharge, and increase downstream water availability by as much as 28 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s a snowball effect that counters degradation, and you get all of these ecosystem services,\u201d she says.",
            "The structures on Nutlouis\u2019s farm are integral cogs in a larger system of floodplain farming. It works like this: Nutlouis\u2019s property lies in an alluvial fan, where mineral-rich sediments and plant waste atop mesas and other uplands wash down onto flatter ground with rainwater, snowmelt, and spring water. Across the valley, similar farms rely on this kind of system, many of which feature stone and stick constructions that Nutlouis helped build. The organic materials trapped behind the structures, says Jonathan Sandor, an emeritus agronomy professor at Iowa State University, \u201care a major input into keeping the fertility of the soils up.\u201d Such small watersheds are optimal: \u201cThese gentle slopes and small watersheds allow runoff but reduce the possibility of high runoff velocities that may damage crops,\u201d Sandor explained in a 2008 paper.",
            "BQ\u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d says an expert.",
            "Whether rock walls or ramps, hand-dug depressions in the soil, earthen walls, or branches plaited into dams, NIDS splash water over a wider area and slow its flow so it can better soak into the soil. Many trap sediments behind them, fertilizing whatever grows nearby. The stone structures create a hyperlocal cooling effect, especially when they\u2019re combined with shade-making vegetation.",
            "Here, too, smallness is a boon. \u201cEven tiny little one-rock dams can make big changes on the landscape,\u201d Norman says. Up to five kilometers downstream from such structures, \u201cwe\u2019ve documented increased vegetation despite drought. We\u2019ve also documented [increased vegetation] up to one kilometer upstream, which indicates water availability.\u201d In this way, an alluvial farm and its NIDS can support plants both sown and wild.\n",
            "\u201cThe moisture we get from winter precipitation is really important for the corn to germinate and grow,\u201d says Nutlouis, \u201cand the monsoon rain is really important to finish our harvest of corn and squash and melons.\u201d He acknowledges that in practice this can look chaotic, with cornfields flooded up to their ears before the water trickles down to the next field.",

            "But lately, climate change has thrown extra challenges at the reservation. \u201cThere\u2019s a serious soil moisture deficit that\u2019s causing a lot of ecological shifts,\u201d Nutlouis says. Much of Black Mesa\u2019s pinyon forest, he says, has succumbed to two decades of drought. Historically, Din\u00e9 have foraged for pinyon pine nuts. They are an important component of food sovereignty on the reservation, and their loss is acutely felt.",
            "But the ecosystem services provided by Nutlouis\u2019s structures on his farm and elsewhere do seem to be meeting those climatic challenges. He\u2019s noticed small juniper trees popping up on hillsides around his property despite the dryness; A cottonwood tree towering over one cornfield is also lush and full. \u201cThe idea that Earth will restore itself with natural seed dispersal\u201d after NIDS begin to do their job \u201chas been my observation,\u201d says Norman. Or as Nutlouis puts it, \u201cWe\u2019re allowing nature to do its own thing and restore itself.\u201d",
            "Still, Nutlouis is inclined to help the process along. His nonprofit Nihikeya (loosely translated as a collective ecological footprint) collaborates with a variety of local and regional grassroots groups that work on food, water, and justice issues, like Tolani Lake Enterprises, First Nations Development Institute, and the Ten Tribes Partnership. Din\u00e9 C.A.R.E., another collaborator, is an environmental justice organization that advocates for community health and land rights across the reservation, as well as for the cleanup of coal- and uranium-polluted rivers and aquifers. \u201cWe especially want to support a lot of renewable projects through solar and wind, and we want to support agriculture too, because having a robust food system is a form of revenue for local farmers,\u201d says executive director Robyn Jackson. \u201cIt also helps with continuing our cultural traditions.\u201d",

Some of those native plants, like wolfberry, are edible, which will also help improve food sovereignty and security. \u201cWe understand that rebuilding watersheds is going to be key to continuing farming into the future,\u201d says T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed executive director Nicole Horseherder.",
            "To house accessions of pinyon and juniper, willow, wolfberry bush, three-leaf sumac, and rabbit brush, Nutlouis is building a seed bank. When put back into the landscape, these plants will help keep the ground moist and mitigate erosion.\n",
            "Nutlouis is working on his master\u2019s degree in sustainable communities at Northern Arizona University, where he studies the Western science that qualifies and quantifies the benefits of traditional practices. But he is also adamant that watershed restoration success is predicated on reforging ancestral kinship connections \u2014 that is, on returning the power to make land-use decisions to clan mothers, who were traditionally Din\u00e9 leaders in this arena. To that end, he\u2019s been meeting with neighbors in one tiny watershed of Burnt Corn Valley after another to discuss how to improve the health of their land, whether for growing corn or just ensuring roads remain intact when it rains. So far, Nutlouis has helped restore 56 fields across the valley, with more NIDS than he can count.",

Miniscule but powerful, their presence can help or hinder ecosystems \u2014 by soaking up greenhouse gas, for example, or by spewing toxins.

As the planet warms, the diversity of the menagerie in many spots is increasing, says Clare Ostle, a marine biogeochemist at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth. But certain species are losing out, she adds, including big juicy plankton thought to be important for food webs and carbon sequestration.

That includes plants, animals, algae, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and things that blur the lines between categories in a way that land-dwelling organisms typically don\u2019t. There are phytoplankton that feed on sunlight and CO2, including glassy diatoms, dinoflagellates with whip-like tendrils, and spherical coccolithophores that are struggling against ocean acidification to build hard calcite shells. Others are zooplankton \u2014 tiny animals including shelled foraminifera, along with fish larvae, tiny worms, and even jellyfish. Some have a lifespan of just days; others, years.",

            "Temperature has a huge impact on plankton, says Fabio Benedetti, an ecological data analyst at the University of Bern. His modelling, in agreement with other work, predicts that as waters warm, plankton will move polewards at a rate of about 21 miles per decade. \u201cSome changes will be massive, like in the Arctic, where entire communities will be replaced by something new,\u201d he says. Phytoplankton seem better able to cope with gradual warming than zooplankton, Benedetti says, so their habitat range and diversity looks set to increase in most regions. But that\u2019s not necessarily good news: the most productive ocean regions, counterintuitively, have low diversity, Benedetti notes. And more diversity doesn\u2019t necessarily mean higher numbers of plankton overall.",
            "In the long term, researchers fear an overall decline in plankton numbers thanks to a dwindling supply of critical nutrients such as nitrogen and iron. Plankton typically rely on nutrients that have been mixed from the ocean bottom up to the surface. But melting polar ice and changing ocean currents are now increasing the density difference between top, fresh waters and deeper, saltier waters, making these layers ever-less-likely to mix. This increased \u201cstratification,\u201d as it is called, is expected to starve ever-more regions of the ocean. While some coastal regions are drowning in too much nitrogen, which runs off agricultural fields, much of the open ocean might become \u201cmore desert-like,\u201d says Hutchins.\n",
            "BQScientists have investigated dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. ",
            "A factor working against this trend is pollution from both the burning of fossil fuels and from wildfires, which can carry nutrients far out into ocean waters. The wildly destructive Australian wildfire season of 2019-2020, for example, poured so much nutritional iron into the water that phytoplankton concentrations doubled between New Zealand and South America, creating an algae bloom bigger than Australia that lasted for months. The biggest surprise was how long the blooms lasted, says Jakob Weis at the University of Tasmania, Hobart, who studied the phenomenon. The amount of carbon soaked up by those organisms is thought to have roughly matched the carbon spewed by the fires \u2014 a helpful factor in the context of climate change. \u201cWe intentionally refrained from framing the blooms as \u2018good news,\u2019 given the devastating impact the wildfires had on the Australian public, wildlife, terrestrial ecosystems, and climate,\u201d says Weis. But the plankton, at least, were \u201chappy.\u201d",
            "Such nutrient influxes could be a big deal, says Hutchins, especially in the Southern Hemisphere where waters are particularly starved of iron. But the long-term impacts are entirely unclear. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know if that\u2019s going to balance out some of what\u2019s not mixing up from below, or if it\u2019s going to select for different communities, different species, because it\u2019s chemically different [food],\u201d says Hutchins. Such blooms won\u2019t make a big dent in the big-picture fight against global warming, adds Ostle. \u201cWe\u2019ve burned thousands of years of deposits of oil and gas. The phytoplankton blooms aren\u2019t going to be able to cut it.\u201d\n",

            "Since the 1990s, some small-scale experiments have investigated the idea of intentionally dumping massive quantities of iron into the ocean to encourage plankton to soak up CO2. But early tests suggested that such a geoengineering scheme might not be very effective at burying carbon in the seabed for the longterm, while being expensive and difficult to carry out \u2014 not to mention the possibly huge, unknown consequences for ocean life. There have been international moratoria against large-scale commercial fertilization efforts since 2008, but research into the idea continues. Just last month, Ken Buesseler at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and colleagues laid out a research agenda for how to best assess this strategy\u2019s possible risks and benefits. \u201cYou learn a lot from these experiments,\u201d says Benedetti, \u201cbut we shouldn\u2019t see this as a long-term solution.\u201d",
            "In the face of so much uncertainty, it\u2019s vital for researchers to get on-the-ground data about how plankton are faring. The longest-running program to do this is the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) Survey, an effort that has been attaching collection devices onto ocean-crossing ships since the 1930s. The technique is simple: Plankton get scooped out of surface waters and squashed onto a filter like bugs on a car windscreen. The filter rolls up as the ship moves along, creating a scroll-like record of plankton roadkill from across the ship\u2019s track. Those filters are delivered to a lab where they are unspooled and the plankton peered at through a microscope. About a dozen workers at the Marine Biological Association, the effort\u2019s headquarters, have been trained to identify more than 600 different types of tiny creature \u2014 a task they are now trying to bolster with artificial intelligence algorithms.\n",
            "BQIn the Atlantic around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining by around 10 percent per decade. ",
            "The vast majority of the CPR\u2019s data comes from the North Atlantic \u2014 a well-travelled region that happens to play an oversized role in global carbon uptake. Ostle, who heads up the Pacific Branch of the CPR, says the data here shows plankton biomass increasing near the pole and decreasing closer to the tropics, as expected.",
            "Most of the increase is, interestingly, diatoms, says Ostle \u2014 large, round phytoplankton that form juicy food balls for fish and which tend to sink quickly, making them good carbon storage bombs. \u201cIt was a surprise to see this,\u201d says Ostle. It\u2019s an important shift: \u201cDiatoms are really the engines of carbon fixation,\u201d says Hutchins, who estimates they are responsible for about half of phytoplanktons\u2019 total carbon uptake.\n",
            "Ostle suspects the explanation behind the unexpected North Atlantic diatom boom lies with sunlight. The increased ocean stratification that can stop nutrients from mixing upwards has also managed to trap diatoms in surface waters that are bathed in more light; they stay in the growing zone for longer. Eventually, says Ostle, the food disadvantage of increased stratification will likely outweigh the light advantage. But when and how remains uncertain.",

            "The story varies from region to region. In the northeast Atlantic, around Northern Europe, plankton abundances are declining at rates of around 10 percent per decade. Some researchers have even suggested that the infamous North Sea cod crash in the 1990s, usually attributed to overfishing, was exacerbated by a plankton deficit. In the Arctic Ocean, though, plankton numbers have blossomed, with productivity increasing by more than half between 1998 and 2018, thanks not just to more open water from melting ice but also to increased nutrients, possibly introduced to the Arctic by storms and shifting currents.",
            "There\u2019s less data in the North Pacific and in the subtropics, but both are now starting to show an important shift away from large diatoms towards dinoflagellates, says Ostle. These smaller creatures are less nutritious; fish have to work harder to eat more of them. \u201cThat could have really big implications for the fisheries. We don\u2019t know yet,\u201d says Ostle.",
            "Dinoflagellates are also the plankton responsible for bioluminescence \u2014 and, sometimes, for generating biotoxins that lead to shellfish poisoning. \u201cWe\u2019re getting big bioluminescent blooms off of Southern California,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cIt\u2019s really pretty if you go out for a walk on the beach at night and the waves are all lighting up, but they also have toxins,\u201d he says. \u201cI think they [dinoflagellates] are going to be one of the winners too, in in the future warmer ocean.\u201d",
            "BQIt takes decades to see long-term climate change impacts in plankton, which are so variable from year to year. ",
            "Ostle has just taken on the job of chair of the Global Alliance CPR Surveys to help create a more comprehensive global picture of how plankton is faring. But it\u2019s hard, she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have funding at the moment to maintain this thing, so we do it voluntarily.\u201d While there are a dozen regional CPR surveys around the world, there are still huge swaths of the ocean where there\u2019s no regular plankton monitoring.",
            "Researchers can try to plug the gaps using satellites. But it takes decades to see long-term climate change impacts in plankton, which are so variable from season to season and year to year. Satellites typically measure color at the surface \u2014 a proxy for how chlorophyl-packed phytoplankton are doing.",
            "Last year, researchers reported that data from NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite showed that more than half of the world\u2019s oceans have gotten greener over the past 20 years. \u201cThat was a very nonintuitive finding for a lot of the community,\u201d says Hutchins. The implications are unclear. \u201cA \u2018greening\u2019 doesn\u2019t necessarily imply an increase in plankton abundance or productivity,\u201d says B.B. Cael of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, who led that work. \u201cWe tried to caution against this [interpretation], but I don\u2019t think the message got across.\u201d Instead, Cael says, the color change might be due to shifts from one kind of plankton to another.",

It can \u201csee\u201d in more than a hundred hues, rather than just the handful that previous satellites could spot. That should let researchers identify some specific species or groups of plankton, says Cecile Rousseaux, PACE science lead at NASA Goddard. \u201cIt tells us not just total phytoplankton, but who is in there, what type of plankton,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new level of information.\u201d",
            "Meanwhile research continues \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty to unravel.

And, she adds, the viruses that attack plankton seem to be on the rise as waters warm \u2014 another factor with as-yet unknown consequences.",
            "Thankfully, says Hutchins, plankton have proven to be pretty robust and adaptable over billions of years of Earth\u2019s history \u2014 so the oceanic food chain will persist in one form or another. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to drive ocean life to extinction,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s going to be different dominant species \u2014 and maybe they\u2019re not going to be the ones we wish were there.\u201d",

            "Some 50 miles southwest of Taipei, Taiwan\u2019s capital, and strategically located close to a cluster of the island\u2019s top universities, the 3,500-acre Hsinchu Science Park is globally celebrated as the incubator of Taiwan\u2019s most successful technology companies. It opened in 1980, the government having acquired the land and cleared the rice fields, with the aim of creating a technology hub that would combine advanced research and industrial production. ",
            "Today Taiwan\u2019s science parks house more than 1,100 companies, employ 321,000 people, and generate $127 billion in annual revenue. Along the way, Hsinchu Science Park\u2019s Industrial Technology Research Institute has given birth to startups that have grown into world leaders. One of them, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), produces at least 90 percent of the world\u2019s most advanced computer chips. Collectively, Taiwan\u2019s companies hold a 68 percent market share of all global chip production. ",
            "It is a spectacular success. But it has also created a problem that could threaten the future prosperity of both the sector and the island. As the age of energy-hungry artificial intelligence dawns, Taiwan is facing a multifaceted energy crisis: It depends heavily on imported fossil fuels; It has ambitious clean energy targets that it is failing to meet; And it can barely keep up with current demand. Addressing this problem, government critics say, is growing increasingly urgent.\n",

In fact, TSMC alone uses around 9 percent of Taiwan\u2019s electricity. One estimate by Greenpeace has suggested that by 2030 Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor manufacturing industry will consume twice as much electricity as did the whole of New Zealand in 2021; The bulk of that enormous energy demand, about 82 percent the report suggests, will come from TSMC.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s government is banking on the continuing success of its technology sector and wants the island to be a leader in A.I. But just one small data center, the Vantage 16MW Data center in Taipei, is expected to require as much energy as some 13,000 households. Nicholas Chen, a lawyer who analyses Taiwan\u2019s climate and energy policies, warns that the collision of Taiwan\u2019s commitments to the clean energy transition and its position in global supply chains as a key partner of multinational companies that have made commitments to net-zero deadlines \u2014 along with the explosive growth in demand \u2014 has all the makings of a crisis.\n",

Excluded at China\u2019s insistence from membership in the United Nations, Taiwan asserts its presence on the margins, convening side events, and adopting the Paris Agreement targets of peak emissions before 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. Its major companies, TSMC included, have signed up to RE100, a corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged to achieve net zero production. But right now, there is a wide gap between aspiration and performance. ",
            "Angelica Oung, a journalist and founder of the Clean Energy Transition Alliance, a nonprofit that advocates for a rapid energy transition, has studied Taiwan\u2019s energy sector for years. When we met in a restaurant in Taipei, she cheerfully ordered an implausibly large number of dishes that crowded onto the small table as we talked. Oung described two major blackouts \u2014 one in 2021 that affected TSMC and 6.2 million households for five hours, and one in 2022 that affected 5.5 million households. It is a sign, she says, of an energy system running perilously close to the edge.\n",

            "The operating margin on the grid \u2014 the buffer between supply and demand \u2014 ought to be 25 percent in a secure system.

            "Taiwan\u2019s current energy mix illustrates the scale of the challenge: Last year, Taiwan\u2019s power sector was 83 percent dependent on fossil fuel: Coal accounted for around 42 percent of generation; natural gas 40 percent; and oil 1 percent. Nuclear supplied 6 percent, and solar, wind, hydro, and biomass together, nearly 10 percent, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.",
            "Taiwan\u2019s fossil fuels are imported by sea, which leaves the island at the mercy both of international price fluctuations and potential blockade by China. The government has sought to shield consumers from rising global prices, but that has resulted in growing debt for the Taiwan Electric Power Company (Taipower), the national provider. In the event of a naval blockade by China, Taiwan could count on about six weeks reserves of coal but not much more than a week of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Given that LNG supplies more than a third of electricity generation, the impacts would be severe. \n",

By the same year, the share of coal would have to come down to 30 percent, gas would have to rise to 50 percent, and renewables would have to leap to 20 percent. None of those targets is on track. ",
            "Progress on renewables has been slow for a number of reasons, according to Oung. \u201cThe problem with solar in Taiwan is that we don\u2019t have a big area. We have the same population as Australia and use same amount of electricity, but we are only half the size of Tasmania and 79 percent of Taiwan is mountainous, so land acquisition is difficult.\u201d Rooftop solar is expensive and roof space is sometimes needed for other things, such as helicopter pads, public utilities, or water tanks.",
            "According to Peter Kurz, a consultant to the technology sector and a long-term resident of Taiwan, there is one renewable resource that the nation has in abundance. \u201cThe Taiwan Strait has a huge wind resource,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the most wind power anywhere in the world available close to a population.\u201d",

            "Despite the attraction of Taiwan\u2019s west coast with its relatively shallow waters, there are other constraints, such as limited harbor space. There is also another concern that is unique to Taiwan\u2019s geography: The west side of the island faces China, and there are continuing incursions into Taiwan\u2019s territorial waters from China\u2019s coast guard and navy vessels. Offshore wind turbines are within easy rocket and missile range from China, and undersea energy cables are highly vulnerable.",

Taiwan\u2019s civil nuclear program was started under the military dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT party with half an eye on developing a nuclear weapons program. Taiwan built its first experimental facility in the 1950s and opened its first power plant in 1978. The DPP came into existence in 1986, the year of the Chernobyl disaster, and its decision to adopt a no-nuclear policy was reinforced by the Fukushima disaster in neighboring Japan in 2011.",

The shuttered reactors have not yet been decommissioned, possibly because, in addition to its other difficulties, Taiwan has run out of waste storage capacity: The fuel rods remain in place because there is nowhere else to put them. As some observers see it, politics have got in the way of common sense: In 2018, a majority opposed the nuclear shutdown in a referendum, but the government continues to insist that its policy will not change. Voters added to the confusion in 2021 when they opposed the completion of the two uncommissioned plants.",
            "On the 13th floor of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Taipei, the deputy director general of Taiwan\u2019s energy administration, Stephen Wu, chose his words carefully. \u201cThere is a debate going on in our parliament,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the public has demanded a reduction of nuclear power and also a reduction in carbon emissions. So there is some discussion about whether the [shuttered] nuclear plants will somehow function again when conditions are ready.\u201d",

            "Wu acknowledged that Taiwan was nudging against the limits of its current supply and that new entrants to Taiwan\u2019s science and technology parks have to be carefully screened for their energy needs. But he took an optimistic view of Taiwan\u2019s capacity to sustain A.I. development. \u201cWe assess energy consumption of companies to ensure the development of these companies complies with environmental protection,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Singapore, data centers are highly efficient.

It is a solution that he believes the Taiwan\u2019s ruling party might come around to.",
            "There is a further security question to add to Taiwan\u2019s complex challenges. The island\u2019s circumstances are unique: It is a functioning democracy, a technological powerhouse, and a de facto independent country that China regards as a breakaway province to be recovered \u2014 if necessary, by force. The fact that its technology industry is essential for global production of everything from electric vehicles to ballistic missiles has counted as a security plus for Taiwan in its increasingly tense stand-off with China. It is not in the interest of China or the United States to see semiconductor manufacturers damaged or destroyed. Such companies, in security jargon, are collectively labelled Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield,\u201d a shield the government is keen to maintain. That the sector depends inescapably on Taiwan\u2019s energy security renders the search for a solution all the more urgent."

            "They call it the Doomsday Glacier. A chunk of Antarctic ice as big as Florida and two thirds of a mile thick, the Thwaites Glacier disgorges into the ocean in a remote region of West Antarctica. Glaciologists say it may be on the verge of total collapse, which could swamp huge areas of low-lying coastal land around the world within a few decades. Now, ambitious plans to save it are set to become an early test of whether the world is prepared to enact massive geoengineering efforts to ward off the worst effects of climate change.",
            "Recent monitoring by uncrewed submarines and satellites, along with ice-sheet modeling, suggest that the Thwaites Glacier and its adjacent smaller twin, the Pine Island Glacier, may already be in a death spiral \u2014 eaten up by the intensifying speed and warmth of the powerful Antarctic Circumpolar Current. If they are past a point of no return, say researchers involved in the studies, then only massive human intervention can save them.\n",
            "Nothing is certain. A new modeling study published last week said the risk of unstoppable retreat of the glacier may be overblown. But there is no time to waste, argues the glaciologist orchestrating the call for action, John Moore of Lapland University, in northern Finland. Within two years, he and colleagues in Europe hope to be working in a Norwegian fjord, testing prototypes for a giant submarine curtain, up to 50 miles across, that could seal off the two glaciers from the remorseless Antarctic current. \n",
            "BQGlaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century.",
            "Meanwhile, some of his collaborators, fearing the logistical complications of such a task, are pondering an even more mind-bending idea. They want to substitute the physical curtain with a giant \u201cbubble curtain,\u201d created by a constant injection of bubbles of air or cold surface water. ",
            "Opponents of the plans, including many glaciologists, say such outlandish proposals are a dangerous diversion from the real task of mitigating climate change by curbing carbon emissions. But advocates say the two glaciers can\u2019t wait. \u201cWe can\u2019t mitigate our way out of this,\u201d says Moore. \u201cWe need other tools.\u201d\n",
            "Glaciologists have discussed scary prognoses for the rapid collapse of giant Antarctic glaciers for almost half a century. Glaciers in West Antarctica are particularly vulnerable because they are not sitting on solid land; they are surrounded by ocean and pinned precariously to the peaks of submarine mountains, between which the circumpolar current swirls.\n",
            "Back in 1978, glaciologist John Mercer, of Ohio State University, warned of a \u201cmajor disaster \u2013 a rapid five-meter rise in sea level, caused by deglaciation of West Antarctica\u201d \u2014 should atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide continue to rise. Three years later, glaciologist Terry Hughes, of the University of Maine, identified a \u201cweak underbelly\u201d to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, where the Thwaites and Pine Island glaciers drain into the Amundsen Sea, an arm of the Southern Ocean.",

            "These glaciers are two of the ice continent\u2019s five largest and are the gateway to the ocean for nearly half of the ice sheet. Hughes warned that the glaciers could easily lose their grip on the submarine mountains as warmer water melts ice directly beneath them, leading to their disintegration within a few decades. Their meltwater would raise sea levels globally by as much as 7 feet. That would rise to more than 12 feet if, as the pair suspected, the glaciers\u2019 demise dragged down the rest of the ice sheet with it.",
            "These fears remained a theoretical concern until 20 years ago, when NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot warned that the seaward flow of these two giant glaciers was accelerating rapidly. It also became clear that the waters lapping at their submerged edges were warming as a result of climate change, and that this melting effect was much greater than the effect of warming air.\n",
            "Ted Scambos of the University of Colorado, who is a coordinator of the joint U.S.-UK International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, says that now \u201cthe [Thwaites] glacier is flowing at over a mile per year,\u201d nearly double the speed in the 1990s. The warm ocean current is \u201ceroding the base of the ice, erasing it as an ice cube would disappear bobbing in a glass of water.\u201d",
            "Scambos believes the accelerated flow is bound to continue. \u201cBy flowing faster, the glacier pulls down the ice behind it.\u201d While shallower ice grinds on the bedrock and gets held back, he explains, thicker ice is less constrained and so flows faster, \u201cleading to more retreat.\u201d",
            "BQ\u201cSome say it is too late to prevent [Thwaites\u2019] collapse,\u201d says a glaciologist. \u201cOthers say we could have 200 years.\u201d ",
            "This concern has only heightened with the recent publication of satellite radar images revealing that the height of the Thwaites Glacier rises and falls with the tides. Rignot, now at the University of California, Irvine, says this finding shows that the warm current is not just lapping at the front of the glacier but is penetrating several miles beneath the grounded ice, further loosening its contact with solid rock. ",
            "Modelers of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet caution against assuming the worst. Much remains unknown. Last week, Mathieu Morlighem of Dartmouth College, along with British colleagues, reported that one potential cause of collapse of the Thwaites Glacier \u2014 runaway instability of the ice cliff at the front of the glacier \u2014 was less likely than some propose, at least in the short term. But he said there was a \u201cpressing need\u201d for further research into these potentially devastating processes.",
            "There is, Moore agrees, no consensus among glaciologists about whether the Thwaites Glacier is past a point of no return unless there is drastic intervention. \u201cSome say it is too late to prevent its collapse; others say we could have 200 years. But it certainly could be beyond its tipping point, and we have to be prepared.\u201d",

            "Last month, Moore and an international team of researchers published a \u201cresearch vision\u201d for \u201cglacial climate intervention.\u201d It followed workshops held last year at Stanford and the University of Chicago with fellow glaciologists, and it warned that if tipping points at the two glaciers have or will soon be crossed, then whatever happens to greenhouse gas emissions in the future \u201cwill have little effect on preserving the ice sheet.\u201d\n",
            "Ice-sheet modeling last year by Kaitlin Naughten of the British Antarctic Survey concurred. \u201cThe opportunity to preserve the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in its present-day state has probably passed,\u201d she concluded, \u201cand policymakers should be prepared for several metres of sea level rise over the coming centuries.\u201d",
            "So what can be done? Last month\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d did not directly advocate for geoengineering interventions but called for research into which of them may be viable. It highlighted a proposal for a series of giant overlapping plastic or fiber curtains tethered to concrete foundations. To hold the warm current at bay, the curtain would stretch for 50 miles across the entrance to the Amundsen Sea and extend upwards for much of the 2,000 feet from the sea floor to the surface.",
            "BQSome experts are confident that giant undersea curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean.",
            "Moore wants to get started on testing the idea, and he and his collaborators are seeking research funding. The first experiments in a large lab tank are expected to begin within a few weeks at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Climate Repair, whose mission is to advance \u201cclimate repair projects that can be rolled out at scale within the next 5-10 years.\u201d",
            "Real-world experiments could follow quickly, says Moore. \u201cWithin two years, we could be working at a fjord in northern Norway, testing different designs in a marine setting.\u201d He has identified a target fjord but won\u2019t say where. \u201cIf that goes well, we would want to scale up to a curtain as much as a kilometer across.\u201d He envisions this being tested among the glaciers of Svalbard, the Norwegian Arctic archipelago that has become an international center for polar research. \u201cIn 10-15 years, we should have something to deploy in Antarctica,\u201d he says.",
            "Moore is confident that such giant curtains can be built to withstand the forces they will face in the ocean. \u201cAnd installation seems feasible with existing technology,\u201d he says. Even so, deployment and maintenance would be a huge undertaking in an environmentally hostile region some 1,500 miles from the nearest ice-free land in South America. And potential impacts on local marine ecosystems from both installation and operation remain essentially unknown, he says.\n",
            "So a diminished version might be tried at the start, says Michael Wolovick of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany. Much could be accomplished with a curtain just three miles wide stretching across a \u201cchoke point\u201d in front of the most vulnerable part of the Thwaites Glacier.",

            "Hugh Hunt, an engineering professor and deputy director of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for Climate Repair, has another proposal. \u201cWe have been looking for ideas that involve less infrastructure,\u201d he says. The most promising would replace a fabricated curtain with a more natural barrier. He proposes laying a pipe along the bed of the Amundsen Sea that would release a constant stream of either air bubbles or cold water pumped down from the surface. \u201cA bubble barrier probably wouldn\u2019t completely halt the flow of warm water,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it would disturb that flow, creating turbulence that would force it to mix with the colder water above.\u201d",
            "Offshore civil engineering companies already use bubble barriers to contain silt and protect marine life from their operations, Hunt says. A giant bubble machine off Antarctica would require a continuous supply of energy, which would have to be renewable. \u201cWith no winter sunlight, solar power wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d he says. \u201cBut offshore wind farms would. And with long-distance submarine cabling improving all the time, we could even generate power far away.\u201d\n",
            "Moore calls the bubble barrier a \u201cwild card.\u201d But, he says, \u201cit is great they are pursuing it, because the potential payoff is huge.\u201d Its main problem right now, he says, is that it remains almost entirely unresearched.",
            "BQAn Antarctic curtain would be hugely expensive, but far less than the cost to protect coastlines from rising tides.",
            "There are other glacier-protecting strategies that avoid the need for curtains or other barriers. Slawek Tulaczyk, a glaciologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has proposed stabilizing the two imperiled glaciers by draining the meltwaters that currently seep to their base, lubricating the pinning points and accelerating the glaciers\u2019 seaward flow. By drilling holes through the glaciers and inserting pumps, engineers could dry up the lubricant and bring that flow to a halt. The extracted water could then be sprayed across the glacier surface, where it would freeze, helping to rebuild the glacier.\n",
            "Are such ideas feasible, how much would they cost, and what are the ethics of all this? Moore puts the likely bill for erecting a curtain across the Amundsen Sea at up to $80 billion. That is a lot of money. But much less, he says, than the trillions of dollars that might be needed to protect coastlines from rising tides caused by the loss of the two glaciers.",
            "Others question this analysis. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt we could spend a decade building the curtain,\u201d says Twila Moon, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado. \u201cIt is a naturally attractive idea that one big project can make the difference. But curtains may just displace the heat elsewhere, melting other ice.\u201d In any event, she says, sea-level rise would continue as a result of factors such as thermal warming of the oceans, land subsidence, and changes in ocean circulation, as well as the melting of other land ice, such as on Greenland. \u201cSo the question is whether this is the right place to put our resources, including limited research funding.\u201d",

            "In an ideal world, Scambos says, \u201cwe could pursue engineering solutions for the poles while at the same time directly decarbonizing our societies.\u201d But the world isn\u2019t like that. Climate negotiators at the UN COP28 meeting last December \u201cbrought up the notion that decarbonizing could go slower now that these [geoengineering] ideas are out there,\u201d Scambos says. \u201cThe idea that \u2018scientists are working on the problem\u2019 could be a death knell for the 22nd century.\u201d",
            "Moore has heard these criticisms. \u201cYes, there is opposition,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to address that. We need a social licence.\u201d He agrees that there are other important causes of current and future sea-level rise. But \u201cnone of these other sources have the potential to raise sea level at the extreme rates and magnitudes that could be realized from a rapid marine ice sheet collapse.\u201d",
            "If the glaciers are past their tipping points, dooming the world\u2019s coastal lands, he says, we may have no alternative but to bite the geoengineering bullet. And the sooner we get started, he says, the better."

            "Down on the south end of California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley, oil rigs have plumbed the earth like flocks of blackened drinking birds for more than a century. Now, they\u2019re fast becoming vestiges of a bygone era. Kern County still produces nearly three-quarters of the state\u2019s oil and gas, but California\u2019s push to decarbonize its energy grid is putting these rigs and the people who operate them out of work. Their disappearance might come as a death knell to the communities that have long depended on bringing energy up to the surface; but now, those same oilfields could offer new life by sending energy back underground.",
            "Ample sunlight and tens of thousands of abandoned oil wells and experienced oilfield workers have made Kern County the focus of a new battery-storage technology. The plan is to retrofit depleted oil wells to store concentrated solar energy in super-heated groundwater for long periods of time, then use that heat to drive turbines when energy demand rises. If it works as planned, the project \u2014 which is being run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and a private investment group and has been dubbed GeoTES, for geological thermal energy storage \u2014 has the potential to overcome some of the renewable energy transition\u2019s greatest hurdles.\n",
            "Six years ago, California announced one of the world\u2019s most aggressive climate goals: carbon-neutral energy production by 2045. But it soon became clear that producing clean energy would not, by itself, suffice to meet the mark. The sun and wind provide power only when the sun shines and the wind blows, and they sometimes produce too much power for the grid to handle. A full energy transition will require storing that power for when it is needed \u2014 whether that is hours, days, or even months from when it is produced.\n",
            "BQThe project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir.",
            "Over the last five years, California has increased its energy storage capacity tenfold to more than 10 gigawatts, and on April 16, in a notable first, batteries provided the largest source of supply in the California grid, if only for two hours. This is huge, but it is still a long way from the 52 gigawatts of stored energy that the California Energy Commission predicts the state will need to meet its ambitious climate goals. So far, storage gains have relied on batteries that use lithium, which is in short supply and is often produced in nations known for human-rights and environmental abuses. ",
            "Faced with fast-approaching decarbonization deadlines, and the challenges of lithium battery production, the California Energy Commission has earmarked $330 million to develop energy storage alternatives. A wave of nascent technology is storing energy in chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical forms. Like GeoTES, some of these methods also store power as heat but do it in aboveground silos filled with molten salt or sand.\n",
            "GeoTES offers something different, said Guangdong Zhu, the senior researcher overseeing the long-duration energy storage program at NREL, which focuses on systems capable of retaining power for 10 or more hours. The project is believed to be the world\u2019s first attempt to store solar energy in a natural geologic reservoir, and it aims to store that energy for more than 1,000 hours. \u201cWe are looking to find the battery, not build it,\u201d he said.",

            "The GeoTES project occupies a dusty patch of ground nestled between well-plumbed oilfields with hundreds of wells \u2014 some idle, some still pumping. Just 1,200 feet below its surface \u2014 shallow by drilling standards \u2014 are pockets of permeable sandstone, now emptied of oil, into which highly brackish water has seeped.",
            "Like the oil it is replacing, GeoTES begins with the sun. At the surface, parabolic mirrors gather solar energy, which is used to heat a silicon oil flowing through an aboveground loop to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Comparatively cold groundwater is pumped up, heated by the oil, then sent back down. As long as the sun is shining, the system heats the water in the reservoir. At night, the water continues circulating, maintaining a temperature of about 500 degrees. When called upon to make electricity, the groundwater is brought to the surface through an extraction well, where its heat spins a turbine.\n",
            "By themselves, none of the pieces that make up GeoTES are cutting edge, Zhu said. \u201cIt\u2019s a new concept, but it\u2019s a combination of different mature technologies. It doesn\u2019t require any kind of scientific or material breakthrough.\u201d What is novel is the process of putting them together.\n",
            "\u201cThe basic concept of geothermal heat transfer is used all the time in geothermal heat pump systems in locations around the world,\u201d said Kenneth Gillingham, an environmental and energy economist at the Yale School of the Environment. \u201cThose are proven to be effective and often cost effective, too.\u201d\n",
            "BQIf the project works and can scale up, it could power Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.",
            "The challenges facing GeoTES are similar to those of geothermal energy generation. Zhu\u2019s team must have a detailed understanding of a reservoir they can\u2019t see \u2014 its volume, porosity, thermal conductivity, the nature of its rocks and how well they can trap fluids, and the presence of any leftover hydrocarbons. The system will also have to manage the buildup of dissolved solids on equipment and react to changes within the reservoir that occur over time.",
            "The beauty of GeoTES, according to Zhu, is its use of existing resources: depleted oilfields with natural reservoirs. Crucially, drillers in much of California have enhanced their oilfields by injecting them with steam to force out more oil. This practice requires a detailed understanding of a reservoir\u2019s characteristics, specifically its ability to hold heat \u2014 data that the GeoTES team needs. However, these requirements also pose a geographic limitation.\n",
            "\u201cYou need reservoirs with the right characteristics,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cYou need the water to be contained without mixing with groundwater, and [you need] the heat contained. Such reservoirs do exist, but they are not everywhere.\u201d\n",
            "NREL has been studying how hot water will interact with the reservoir once injected underground, and Premier\u2019s data shows the site is far removed from any drinking or irrigation water. Construction awaits drilling permits and an environmental impact statement. By 2027, Zhu says he hopes the system will generate 100 kilowatts, or enough energy to run about 10 homes for 24 hours. At that capacity, the project\u2019s surface footprint will consist of a half-acre drill pad and a two-acre solar array. Eventually, Zhu and his team hope to scale up to a 400-megawatt system, which will cover nearly 2,000 acres at the surface and circulate within reservoirs with about the same volume as One World Trade Center underground. That $2 billion system could power nearby Bakersfield\u2019s 300,000 homes for 42 days.\n",

In 2017, Premier had leased land in the county, hoping to strike crude, but it couldn\u2019t get the necessary permits, said Mike Umbro, a partner in Premier who got his start in the Texas shale fracking boom.",
            "Kern County is home to 28,417 oil and gas wells \u2014 68 percent of the state\u2019s wells \u2014 that no longer produce, either because they\u2019ve run dry or their operators have moved on, according to a 2023 report from the Sierra Club. Sitting idle, abandoned wells leak methane and volatile organic compounds, and capping a single well runs about $111,000. Premier hoped to find some life in idle wells, but by 2020, after years of tightening environmental regulations and the passage of its lofty climate goals, California had unofficially quit issuing the permits needed to drill. By then, Premier said it had sunk $800,000 into cleaning up the mess previous oil drillers had left on the site, and Umbro was left wondering, \u201cDo we just scrap this whole thing?\u201d",
            "Instead, Premier\u2019s partners \u2014 engineers experienced in managing thermal reservoirs \u2014 took a look at their mountain of site-specific thermodynamic data and recognized an opportunity to invest in NREL\u2019s novel geothermal storage idea.

            "Like oilfields elsewhere in California, however, Kern\u2019s oilfields have followed a downward trend. Its oil output has fallen to 87 million barrels and its fossil fuels workforce has shriveled from 50,000 in 2015 to 13,770 today as the fracking revolution has sent investment to others parts of the country.\n",
            "To survive, Kern is investing heavily to reinvent itself as a renewable-energy hub while luring new private ventures with generous tax breaks. Kern is now home to the country\u2019s largest wind farm, and it has plans for a massive solar-powered direct-air carbon-capture facility; the world\u2019s largest standalone solar and lithium-ion battery storage project; and a borax mine with enough lithium in its waste rock to make batteries for 70,000 electric vehicles a year.\n",

These solutions could address the long-duration problem, but for now, Murtaugh and other say, they must compete against cheap natural gas and better-established lithium battery technology. That is bound to change, though.",
            "\u201cLithium-ion is probably the cheapest solution if you\u2019re thinking about a four-hour storage solution,\u201d Murtaugh said, but its cost of storage increases linearly with capacity \u2014 more storage requires more manufacturing and maintaining more batteries. The earth retains heat extremely well, he said, and once a geothermal storage facility is running, its costs will be relatively flat over longer durations.",
            "Zhu believes the risks of unproven technologies like GeoTES have hindered investment in long-duration storage. Utilities and energy developers have instead leaned toward bringing down the cost of lithium batteries and photovoltaics. So far, only 4 gigawatts of California\u2019s total 52-gigawatt goal for energy storage are slated to be long-duration.",
            "\u201cIt\u2019s short sighted to just focus on those dominating technologies without looking into a whole picture,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking for some technology which can work on the seasonal scale, you don\u2019t have many options.\u201d"

            "After sitting dormant since the 1980s, the Pinyon Plain uranium mine began operating in January on the Kaibab National Forest in Arizona, about seven miles south of the Grand Canyon. Thanks to new interest in expanding nuclear power, the price of uranium is on a tear, making undeveloped and long-shuttered mines viable. Pinyon Plain, which has some of the highest-grade uranium ore in the country, is one of the first uranium mines to open in the United States in eight years.",
            "It will not be the last. In the U.S. and around the world, uranium mining is experiencing a revival. At least five producers in the U.S. are reactivating mines in Texas, Utah, Wyoming, and Arizona, all of which closed after the 2011 disaster at Fukushima sent the price of uranium plummeting. Other projects are underway internationally, including new mines planned in Canada, India, and Mongolia.\n",
            "The resurgence of uranium mining is linked, in large part, to global efforts to tackle climate change. At last year\u2019s COP28 U.N. climate conference in Dubai, more than 20 countries, including the U.S., committed to tripling nuclear energy capacity by 2050 as a strategy to end dependence on fossil fuels. And in late February, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation intended to speed up development of next-generation nuclear power plants; the Senate has its own version of the bill.\n",
            "BQThe world will need up to 100,000 tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean doubling mining.",
            "Another driver of the search for new sources of uranium, which is essential to nuclear reactors, is geopolitics. The U.S. and other countries are working to end their dependence on uranium from Kazakhstan and Russia \u2014 two of the world\u2019s largest suppliers of the mineral. Since last April, the price for uranium has doubled, to more than $90 per pound, further helping to drive the global comeback. \u201cUranium Is Finally Running Hot, and Miners Can\u2019t Keep Up,\u201d read a recent headline in The Wall Street Journal.",
            "Uranium companies are now using mining technologies, like in-situ leaching, that they claim will drastically reduce their environmental impacts. But based on the industry\u2019s track record of polluting air, water, and soil with both radioactivity and heavy metals, and its obfuscation of mining\u2019s environmental threats, many observers \u2014 especially Indigenous people, who have borne the brunt of past uranium mining and who still suffer health problems linked with unremediated mining sites \u2014 remain skeptical.\n",
            "Exploration continues nonetheless. \u201cEveryone is convinced there is going to be a much larger demand for uranium going forward,\u201d said Matthew L. Wald, an energy analyst for the American Nuclear Society, a nonprofit organization that promotes nuclear power, and the Breakthrough Institute. \u201cThe domestic uranium mining industry is being brought back to life.\u201d",

            "\u201cThe utilities that serve most of the electric load in most of the U.S. are promising to reduce their carbon to near zero by 2050,\u201d said Wald. Solar and wind will provide some of the needed power, but as the need for electricity soars, especially to charge electric vehicles, he said, \u201cthey are looking extremely eagerly at advanced reactors.\u201d",
            "If small modular reactors \u2014 units that can produce up to 300 megawatts of energy \u2014 prove efficient and economical, Wald says, they could be mass produced quickly and further increase the demand for uranium. There are plans for several small modular reactors, which have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, currently underway in the U.S. and Canada. \n",
            "According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the world will need up to 100,000 metric tons of uranium per year by 2040, which would mean nearly doubling mining from current levels. And so companies around the globe are both looking for new deposits and reopening old mines. In Canada, a giant new uranium mine received ministerial approval in November: After receiving its other approvals, the mine\u2019s operators claim that the Rook 1 Project, in Saskatchewan, will in just a few years provide nearly a quarter of the world\u2019s projected uranium needs. In India, the government has announced plans to open what would be one of that country\u2019s largest mines, and a French company, Orano, just signed a deal to open two large mines in Mongolia, which would generate about 4 percent of the world\u2019s uranium production.\n",
            "BQSupporters of uranium mining say new methods are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past.",
            "Greenland, meanwhile, is going against this trend. Concerned with the possible health impacts of mining, the Indigenous Inuit government in 2021 banned prospecting, exploration, and exploitation of uranium. And in 2023 it denied a permit for an Australian company to mine a massive deposit of rare earth metals called Kvanefjeld because bringing them to the surface would also convey uranium, with which it is commingled. ",
            "What will this new era of uranium mining mean for the environment? Historically, the industry has polluted groundwater, surface water, and soil around the world with radioactive waste and dust, heavy metals, and acid mine drainage. In some places, damage has been remediated by industry and government. But in many cases, due to cost or the difficulty of remediation, the pollution still contaminates the environment.",
            "But supporters of uranium mining say that new methods and technologies are much cleaner than the open-pit mines of the past and have far smaller footprints. That\u2019s because most new mines now use in-situ leaching, in which ore is left in the ground and miners recover the earth\u2019s minerals by dissolving them with hydrogen peroxide or an acid or alkaline leach. The \u201cpregnant\u201d solution is then pumped to the surface, where uranium is extracted in a recovery plant.",

Fifty-seven percent of the world\u2019s total uranium was produced using in-situ leaching in 2019, up from 16 percent in 2000, according to the World Nuclear Association, an industry group.",
            "\u201cWhen [the U.S.] led the world in production in 1980, much of our production was conventional open pit and underground,\u201d said Scott Melbye, president of Uranium Producers of America and CEO of Uranium Royalty, which provides capital for mines. \u201cEighty to 90 percent of production going forward [will be] coming from in-situ recovery.\u201d",
            "Mines in the U.S., he said, are held to extremely high standards compared with mines in some other countries, and nuclear energy is going to play a much larger role in the future of energy. \u201cIf we cross our arms and say we don\u2019t want any mining in the United States, that just means you are willing to take stuff from Uzbekistan, Kirghizstan, and the Congo, where there is child labor and no attention paid to air quality or water quality or all those things.\u201d",
            "BQThe controversial Pinyon Plain mine sits beneath Red Butte, on land that many tribes say is sacred.",
            "In-situ mining, however, is not without risks, which include the contamination of groundwater with radon, heavy metals, and leaching fluids. The Obama administration proposed tighter standards to regulate byproduct materials produced by in-situ uranium mining, with a focus on groundwater protection and restoration, but the Trump administration rolled those regulations back. According to Geoffrey Fettus, former director the Natural Resource Defense Council\u2019s recently shuttered nuclear program, before mining a site, \u201cindustry should be required to test the groundwater; then, once mining is done, it should clean up the water to the level it was before mining.\u201d And finally, Fettus writes on the NRDC website, \u201cit should transparently monitor the site to make sure the cleanup sticks, with either the EPA or the states overseeing this. It sounds straightforward, and it is.\u201d ",
            "Those most skeptical of the new era of uranium mining are people who live near old mining sites across the American West, where the scramble to find uranium to build the first atomic bombs during the Cold War left open pits and radioactive waste piles and dust scattered across the landscape. A disproportionate number of these sites are on or near Indigenous land.\n",

            "In 2016, the mine\u2019s owner, Energy Fuels Resources, was pushing forward with construction when it ruptured a perched aquifer \u2014 a confined pool of water sitting above the local water table. The company pumped this excess water into an open-air holding pond. But the pond wasn\u2019t big enough, so the company used water cannons to spray the overflow, which was tainted with arsenic and uranium at levels well above federal standards, into the sky to enhance the evaporation rate.\n",
            "Because it is in a sensitive natural and cultural area, the Pinyon Plain mine has raised objections from a long list of tribal officials and environmentalists. As Energy Fuels Resources pushes forward with mining, experts fear it could leak radioactivity into nearby groundwater that serves the Havasupai Tribe and flows into the waters of the Grand Canyon.\n",
            "\u201cThe aquifer feeds the Grand Canyon springs,\u201d said Taylor McKinnon, Southwest director of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cThey are incredibly important biologically and important to the Havasupai, whose name, People of the Blue-Green Water, ties to one of those springs.\u201d\n",
            "BQThere are hundreds of abandoned uranium mines in the Four Corners region that have yet to be cleaned up.",
            "Then there is the issue of mining waste that has been left in place for decades. \u201cDepending on whose numbers you use, there are 500 or a thousand or more uranium mines in the Four Corners region, many of them on the Navajo Nation, that are abandoned and have yet to be reclaimed or cleaned up,\u201d said McKinnon. He has worked on uranium issues in the Southwest since 2007 and is battling the Pinyon Plain mine because of its potential to contaminate groundwater. Many of those sites \u201ccontinue to pollute,\u201d McKinnon adds. \u201cAs you can imagine, that rightfully casts doubt on regulators and industry\u2019s claims that it\u2019s going to be done right this time.\u201d",
            "The largest accidental release of radioactive water in the U.S. occurred in 1979, when the tailings disposal pond at New Mexico\u2019s Church Rock mine, owned by the United Nuclear Corporation, breached its dam and sent 94 million gallons of radioactive waste into the Rio Puerco. The water flowed onto the Navajo Nation, where radioactive pollution remains in waterways and in soil where livestock graze. Every year, the community commemorates the spill by walking to the site of the dam breach and offering healing prayers.\n",
            "Studies have found that proximity to uranium mines increases the likelihood of illness, including kidney disease, hypertension, and other chronic diseases; a 2019 study revealed elevated autoimmunity in people living near abandoned mine sites on the Navajo Nation. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the risk of radiation,\u201d says Eric Jantz, an attorney at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. \u201cBut also the chemical properties of mine waste\u201d\u2014 including arsenic and other heavy metals \u2014 \u201cthat are really problematic from a public health standpoint.\u201d\n",

The conflagration killed 1.3 million Joshua trees, including most of those on Cima Dome, one of the largest and densest Joshua tree woodlands in the world.\n",
            "Then in 2023, the York Fire swept through and burned a large section of adjacent Joshua tree forest, killing another million or so trees. The destruction on Cima Dome \u2014 which is higher in elevation and cooler than the surrounding desert \u2014 came as an especially severe blow to the National Park Service and conservationists who had considered it a stronghold for the eastern Joshua tree and a key to the species\u2019 future.\n",
            "Experts were planning to make Cima Dome a refuge by clearing out invasive grasses and monitoring the woodland\u2019s health, said Andrew Kaiser, a botanist who worked at the Mojave National Preserve during the fires and now works for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, developing its Western Joshua Tree Conservation Plan. \u201cThe perimeter of the 2020 Dome fire was essentially the exact outline of the model climate refugia.

Lightning would hit a tree and it would fall. Rarely would it burn beyond an acre.\u201d Now, he said, larger fires are prevalent.",
            "Such blazes are one of the major threats to Joshua trees: Hotter and drier weather, which kills seedlings and reduces recruitment of new trees, is another important factor.

Precipitation in the Mojave, the most arid place in North America, varies widely but averages 5 inches a year.

            "At the same time, wet years also help plant species that threaten the Joshua tree. \u201cOver the last few decades, the invasive grasses originally brought here by cattle ranching and other sources have taken over the Mojave, [changing] the fire regime,\u201d said Cummings. Grasses such as red brome and Mediterranean split grass are highly flammable, and in wet years they grow in profusion and create more intense and far more widespread fires.",
            "There is also concern that the invasion of exotic species, in combination with climate change and the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen \u2014 which wafts in from the smoggy Los Angeles basin and stimulates the growth of flammable grasses \u2014 will keep the post-fire Joshua woodlands from reestablishing themselves. Instead, those areas could convert to a non-native grassland with low biodiversity.",

            "The western Joshua tree has been proposed for threatened status under the California Endangered Species Act and has been regulated, since 2023, by the state\u2019s Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act, which forbids cutting trees from either private or public land without authorization from the state. The federal government, under both the Trump and Biden administrations, rejected federal endangered species protection for both subspecies, most recently in 2023.",
            "One reason for the lack of protection is that there is currently no shortage of Joshua trees \u2014 the threat is based on projections of future loss. The population of eastern Joshua trees is estimated to be several million, and the western population contains as many as 10 million trees. Nonetheless, Cummings argues that they are both deserving of protection because the forecasts of the future look bleak. \u201cWe know they are on an extinction trajectory, given the threat of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf climate change is frozen at current levels, we [still] lose half their range.\u201d Temperatures, of course, are not expected to remain steady.",

In Joshua Tree National Park, managers are clearing grasses in refugia, for example, to remove fuel and create fire breaks between trees.",
            "Researchers are also mapping the trees\u2019 genomes to predict which populations are most resilient to heat and drought so their preservation can be prioritized or their seeds used for replanting.\n",
            "Assisted migration \u2014 physically moving adult trees to Northern California and Oregon \u2014 has been considered. But \u201cyou can\u2019t just move the Joshua tree,\u201d Kaiser, from California\u2019s Department of Fish and Wildlife, said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to move the nurse plants [which help seedlings get established]. You\u2019ve got to move the yucca moth pollinator. You\u2019ve got to monitor. All of the research we\u2019ve seen so far suggests it\u2019s not a viable option at this moment in time.

            "Long, V-shaped eel traps cross from shore to shore on Italy\u2019s Comacchio Lagoons, pointing like arrowheads out to the Adriatic Sea. When eels headed to their ocean breeding grounds arrive at the tip of the V, aluminum panels allow them into the trap, but not out. Metal replaced wood and reeds in the 1980s, but otherwise the design of the trap is the same as it has been since ancient times. ",
            "On a recent foggy morning at Comacchio, I met up with Stefano Gelli, who was clearing a trap in one of the lagoons\u2019 northern basins. When Gelli was growing up, 40 years ago, a single night\u2019s catch could total 10 tons.",
            "\u201c\u2026Sixteen, seventeen\u2026\u201d Gelli grabbed tight onto the slimy fish and tossed them into a plastic tub, where they slithered over each other in slimy circles. \u201c\u2026eighteen, nineteen.\u201d He threw in the last one. Comacchio\u2019s eels once filled the lagoons; now they fit inside a bucket.",
            "For thousands of years, the ubiquity of this fatty fish made eels the backbone of poor men\u2019s diets across the continent. They were served in soups and risottos in Italy, fried to a crisp and stacked on crackers in Spain, boiled to a soft texture in Scandinavia, set floating in a gelatinous goop in England, smoked in their skin in Germany and Holland, and enjoyed as a Christmastime staple everywhere.\n",
            "BQFor many biologists, closing down the European eel fishery seems like the last option left after many years of neglect.",
            "Yet so calamitous has the collapse of the European eel population been over the last half-century, the species now risks going the way of the passenger pigeon. In 2008, the International Union for Conservation of Nature took the step of classing the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) as critically endangered. Around the same time, the European Union adopted a comprehensive eel regulation establishing measures to support the recovery of the stock, including through seasonal fishing closures and limits.",
            "But a recovery has failed to materialize, and scientists now say that only urgent and extreme action can save this iconic fish. In its annual report for 2024, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) \u2014 the regional fishery advisory body whose findings provided the basis for the EU\u2019s Eel Regulation \u2014 is now urging that \u201cthere should be zero catches in all habitats.\u201d For many biologists, closing down the eel fishery, at least temporarily, seems like the last option left after many years of neglect. \u201cIt\u2019s been a century of \u2018we knew the problem and we didn\u2019t face it,\u2019\u201d Willem Dekker, a Dutch biologist known as the architect of the EU Eel Regulation, told me.",
            "Eels are at once a familiar component of European culture and a mystery to everyone who has ever studied them. Aristotle tried to crack the question of eel reproduction as early as the 300s B.C., eventually concluding that the fish must miraculously generate out of muddy riverbeds. At the time, no one had found the eels\u2019 sex organs. Nor had they witnessed eels reproducing in the wild, a page in the scientific record that remains blank to this day: no pair of European eels has ever been caught in the act.",

            "European eels are born in the Sargasso Sea, an amorphous body of water in the Western Atlantic bordered not by land but by shifting ocean currents. The tiny, transparent, larvae are then carried on the current to Europe\u2019s Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. Here, they complete their first metamorphosis into longer but still transparent \u201cglass eels.\u201d Glass eels travel up freshwater streams and rivers, where they settle on a long-term home, living for years or decades as longer and darker \u201cyellow eels\u201d before finally transitioning to shiny and reproductively mature \u201csilver eels.\u201d At that point, some unknown force calls them to swim down to unfathomable depths on a migration of nearly a thousand miles back to the Sargasso Sea, where they spawn, and then die.",
            "Both the European eel\u2019s ovaries and testes develop in earnest only en route to the Sargasso Sea, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 1700s that the ovaries of a female eel (hailing from the Comacchio Lagoon) were first identified through meticulous anatomical dissection. The testes took even longer to find. A young Sigmund Freud \u2014 then a medical student on his way to becoming the philosopher supreme of sexual repression \u2013\u2014was one of many men who toiled above the scalpel to find the male eel\u2019s reproductive organs. (Freud spent the spring of 1876 in Trieste, about a hundred miles northeast of Comacchio, fruitlessly picking apart healthy eels from the Adriatic for his advisor in Vienna.)\n",
            "BQThe market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels.",
            "The eel\u2019s mysterious life cycle resists standard fisheries science. To create management plans, biologists often rely on a figure called the spawning stock biomass, or SSB, which is calculated as the total biomass of reproductively mature fish. Since reproductively mature European eels hide far out of sight in the dark depths of the Atlantic, there is no way to accurately estimate the species\u2019 SSB. \u201cFish stock assessment is a routine business and involves a lot of mathematics,\u201d said Willem Dekker. \u201cThere are protocols for how to do it.\u201d In the case of European eel, \u201cdoing those things without knowledge, without data, without the hard models that make life so easy, makes it much more challenging.\u201d",
            "No one has figured out how to breed and raise eels artificially, either. Scientists have managed to induce European eel reproduction in labs through hormone treatments, but the difficulty of determining the environmental conditions and diet that eel larvae need to survive has meant that few lab-raised eels live for more than three months. Therefore, eel farms must rely on a supply of wild-captured glass eels that they can then raise to commercial size. The market for young European eels is strongest in Asia, where traffickers are shipping staggering quantities of glass eels to satisfy the Japanese appetite for the fish, in direct violation of a 2010 EU law prohibiting the export of eels beyond EU borders.\n",

            "Since management authorities cannot rely on aquaculture to meet market demand and relieve pressure on wild eel stocks, they have had to focus on more direct conservation strategies. But they are struggling to come up with solutions, since the reasons for the European eel\u2019s collapse are not straightforward. Data collection has revealed a 15 percent annual drop in the levels of glass eels arriving at European coasts beginning in 1980. There are clearly a number of factors at play in this long decline, but the extent of each is uncertain.",
            "Overfishing, it seems, is only one piece of the puzzle, as shown by the failure of the EU\u2019s fishing regulations to produce a recovery. Another is habitat destruction, as dams, hydropower plants, and land reclamation cut off important migration routes. Diseases, such as Anguillid herpesvirus, as well as heavy metals and pollutants, are also known to lower eels\u2019 reproductive chances, and a warming Atlantic may be shifting the currents eels rely on to complete their life cycle. The recent surge of illegal trafficking of juveniles to Asia has surely put another dent in the population.",
            "\u201cPeople want to have a clear answer, but we\u2019re not able to provide it,\u201d admitted Caroline Durif, one of the current chairs of the ICES Working Group on Eels. When asked the reason for the eels\u2019 sharp decline, Willem Dekker said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Full stop. Fishing, habitat loss, pollution, all those things, nobody knows.\u201d\n",
            "BQThe mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. ",
            "In order to ban the capture of European eels, as proposed by ICES, the European Parliament would need to repeal and amend the current EU directive requiring countries to adopt measures to support the stock\u2019s recovery. This seems unlikely given that a 2023 committee vote on a resolution calling for renewed commitment to the regulation won the support of 80 percent of delegates present. \u201cThere\u2019s no will to do a ban, and also it wouldn\u2019t help,\u201d Andrew Kerr, the chair of a nonprofit coalition of conservationists, scientists, and commercial fishermen called the Sustainable Eel Group (SEG), told me over video call from his home in England. \u201cThe eel is much more complex than that, and if you stop fishing, you\u2019re not going to save the eel. What you need is a very controlled level of fishing, but we have to work on all the environmental factors.\u201d",
            "Durif acknowledges that the EU still needs some convincing from the scientific community before it will accept a zero-catch limit. \u201cThe EU is working on making a special request to ICES to see if we can measure the efficiency of the regulation, which we keep on saying we can\u2019t,\u201d she said. She noted that the advice for a ban follows the precautionary approach, a commonly agreed principle in fisheries to implement management measures, however drastic, aimed at reaching specific population points. \u201cSince we don\u2019t have the data to say whether this or that, hydropower or fisheries, is causing more mortality, we can\u2019t give advice for less [than a ban], or more precise advice.\u201d\n",

            "The mysteries surrounding the eel allow different groups with their own priorities to shift the blame for the collapse. The SEG argues that the management focus should be on ensuring that glass eel fisheries, distributors, farms, smokehouses and retailers, which account for about 90 percent of the legal European market, operate within the bounds of existing EU regulations. The group has developed a standard for all commercial operators to follow for SEG certification and is also pushing to combat trafficking to Asia. ",
            "Kerr has been writing to the EU for over a decade and has spoken to gathered authorities at the Hague on the problem of illegal glass eel shipments. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time to make eel become an EU priority in countertrafficking,\u201d he said. In the late 2010s, police crackdowns gained speed. The 2017 discovery of $547,000 worth of glass eels hidden under crates of other legal fish in Heathrow Airport produced the headline \u201cTrafficking makes eels \u2018as valuable as cocaine\u2019.\u201d Operation LAKE, coordinated by Interpol between 2022 and 2023, led to the arrest of 256 people suspected of illegal eel trafficking.\n",
            "BQIn Sweden, the threat of hydropower plants to migrating eels is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing.",
            "Eel fishermen around Europe fear their livelihoods being put on hold by a fishing ban, and they argue that the authorities should be addressing other known mortality factors. In Sweden, the threat of the country\u2019s 2,300 hydropower plants, whose turbines routinely tear migrating eels to shreds, is estimated to be equal to or greater than that posed by fishing. On the shores of H\u00e4no Bay in southeastern Sweden, also known as the Eel Coast, a group of fishermen and activists is campaigning to preserve the eel fishing traditions of the area, which date back to medieval times, when eel was a currency used to pay taxes, rent, and debts, and which survive in the form of traditional eel dinners inside the fishermen\u2019s cottages. Dafvid Hermansson, a local historian and board member of Eel Coast Cultural Heritage, criticizes policymakers for evading the questions of hydropower turbines and habitat degradation, and opting to pick the \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d of fishing restrictions. \u201cLess than 1 percent of the fully grown, mature eels leaving the Swedish coastline are being fished,\u201d he claimed.",
            "Scientists, however, almost unanimously maintain that imposing a fishing ban is necessary, if not necessarily sufficient. Giuseppe Castaldelli, a biologist consultant for the Po Delta Park, which administers the Commachio Lagoons, insists: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to extinguish the fishery. The tradition should stay. It\u2019s only right. It\u2019s the history of these places. But if we need to stop fishing for five years, let\u2019s stop fishing for five years. The population numbers continue to go down; soon we risk going underneath the survival threshold of the species.\u201d"

All seven sea turtle species are currently endangered or threatened, notes Christine Figgener, a German-born conservation biologist who has been working in Costa Rica for the past 16 years. ",
            "The number of nesting females on the beaches she studies is down more than 80 percent from when she first arrived there, Figgener said in an interview with Yale Environment 360. It\u2019s part of a global decline driven by a perfect storm of threats including plastics in the ocean, chemical pollution, industrial fishing, unregulated coastal development, and climate change.",
            "Figgener, 40, gained international attention when a video that she took of a sea turtle with a plastic straw lodged in its nostril went viral. The video helped launch a movement to eliminate plastic straws, which led to bans in Seattle and other cities around the world. But she says that\u2019s only a start. \u201cOur world, our oceans are much too complex to say that if we just stop eating fish or using plastic straws or what have you, sea turtles will be safe,\u201d she said.",

Or in some cases the ocean would wash them away if they were buried too low down on the beach. So what we do is we put a little bag under the female while she is laying the eggs and we take the eggs to a more secure place to rebury them.

JBS is our biggest beef company. It slaughters more than 12 million animals a year, exporting their meat to the United States, Europe, and across the world. And it\u2019s not just a beef company. It exports leather \u2014 for instance to Germany, where it makes car seats \u2014 and biodiesel made from beef tallow. ",
            "e360: Can you describe how you tracked its supply chain?\n",
            "Gomes: Since 2011, Brazil has had legislation intended to improve the transparency of sources of supply of beef and other agricultural commodities. So, at Rep\u00f3rter Brasil, which was founded in 2008, we began to collect this public data on everything related to environmental, social, and labor issues. We started to cross-check the data so we could trace supply chains right from the ranch to consumers.",
            "Then we put this information together with data on areas where ranchers had been fined for environmental violations such as deforestation, and where there were reports of modern slavery and forced or child labor. We also used satellite images to identify which farms had seen deforestation each year, and we tapped into data on the transport of cattle from those farms to the slaughterhouses receiving the cattle.",

            "The second part of our investigations has been the consumer market. JBS sells around the world. So, in 2021, we hired researchers in Europe and the U.S., as well as Brazil, to visit stores to find Brazilian beef and take pictures of the seals and export tracking numbers. Through those numbers, we could track back to the original packing plant where the beef came from. For us it was very important to go to the supermarkets and take pictures, and to have that clear evidence.",
            "Then we connected both ends of the supply chain, and called everybody \u2014 the supermarkets, the slaughterhouses, the traders, JBS, the public health authorities, everyone \u2014 to tell them what we had found and ask for them to respond. Several supermarket chains in Europe believed our findings straight away and announced boycotts just as our report was published. They included Sainsbury\u2019s in the U.K., Carrefour in Belgium, and Auchan in France. Later, others joined them.\n",
            "e360: How important is your grassroots work with labor unions and Indigenous people?\n",
            "Gomes: Very important. They guide us in the field to identify the ranches, and sometimes protect us from violence. They know the routes the trucks take, the names of people we can interview, and the workers who can tell inspectors about slavery. Indigenous communities especially know about the environmental impact they are suffering from the deforestation.",

            "e360: You talk about cattle laundering \u2014 raising cattle on recently deforested land, and then moving the animals to graze somewhere else for a short while to create the impression of a supply chain that doesn\u2019t involve deforestation. Is that a big issue?",
            "Gomes: Yes. It is common to move cattle from farm to farm in Brazil, often three or four times. There can be legitimate reasons for doing this, because cattle raising is quite a specialized business. But it can also cover up a \u201cdirty\u201d trail.",
            "In theory there are rules to prevent the trading of cattle from illegal to legal areas. But in practice it is very easy to do, especially when you have several members of a family doing the same business. One brother can move cattle to the land of another brother, with no paperwork. Also, you can change the boundaries of your own land, for instance, by turning one ranch into two, one clean and the other dirty. Then you can just trade with companies like JBS from the clean part. \n",

And few rivers carry a headier and more sobering brew of history \u2014 tales of human woe and triumph \u2014 than the Tigris and Euphrates, the fabled waterways that pour through the heartlands of Eurasian civilization, through the Fertile Crescent, from their chilly headwaters in the mountains of Turkey through vast watersheds in Syria, Kuwait, and Iran, to finally empty into Persian Gulf at the sweltering marshland shores of Iraq.",
            "Ten years ago, I walked with Yazar along the banks of Tigris at the antique settlement of Hasankeyf in Turkey. A local shepherd named \u00c7oban Ali Ayhan sang for us there an old ballad that was more like a cry of pure agony. His voice bounded down the sandstone canyons of the Tigris, with a song that was a hymn to true love, which is to say, to love unrequited. It was an ode to loneliness, to waiting, to the exquisite suffering of betrayal. In other words: the perfect song for both the ancient riverbed and its doomed town, which would soon disappear under the reservoir of yet another massive government dam. The caverns of Hasankeyf, once lit by the campfires of the Neolithic, as well as nearby ruins of fortress walls, ornate minarets, and cliff-top citadels \u2014 a unique trove of architectural wonders that had seen the passing of Roman legionnaires and Silk Road caravans, some 12,000 years of memory \u2014 were soon to be erased.",

            "But that\u2019s slowly beginning to change. Thanks to a slate of federal and state incentive programs, school districts all over the country are starting to swap out old diesel buses for new, zero-emissions electric-powered models.",
            "This transition is reaching districts of all sizes and demographics, from Martinsville Independent School District in East Texas \u2014 which last year became the first in the country to go fully electric with four new buses \u2014 to Oakland Unified School District in California \u2014 which last month became the first large urban district to fully electrify its fleet, with 74 buses.",
            "As the Environmental Protection Agency, through its $5 billion Clean School Bus program, and state initiatives continue to fund electric bus purchases, advocates are identifying challenges to wider adoption and grappling with how to surmount them.\n",
            "BQReplacing decades-old buses may lead to benefits in educational performance and school attendance rates, said one study.",
            "Five years ago, there were fewer than a thousand electric school buses operating nationwide, the majority of them in higher-income suburban districts. But since the EPA launched its Clean School Bus (CSB) program in 2022, authorized by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the number of electric buses on the road has climbed to nearly 5,000. And more than 7,000 additional buses are under contract, awaiting delivery, or have been awarded funding and will soon be ordered.",
            "From a health perspective, there\u2019s urgency to replacing the nation\u2019s diesel buses with cleaner alternatives. Health experts have long known that children are uniquely vulnerable to air pollution because their lungs, brains, and other major organs are still developing. They breathe faster and take in a higher volume of air relative to their body weight.",
            "Diesel exhaust is classified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization and contains fine particles and nitrogen oxides, both of which are well-documented asthma triggers. Research shows that children in lower-income areas and communities of color are exposed to higher levels of outdoor air pollution \u2014 from major roadways, industries, and ports with diesel truck operations. They also suffer much higher rates of asthma and respiratory illness. And so it\u2019s particularly important, say public health experts and school officials, to get polluting school buses off the streets.\n",

            "Meredith Pedde, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Michigan\u2019s School of Public Health, led a study published earlier this year that found that replacing decades-old buses may lead to proportionately greater benefits in educational performance and attendance rates. She and her colleagues drew on data from an earlier EPA program that randomly allocated funding for cleaner diesel, gas, or propane school buses from 2012 through 2017. They found that districts that received funding for bus upgrades saw significant improvements in students\u2019 attendance rates and in math and literacy test scores.",
            "\u201cOne of our hypotheses is that higher exposures could lead to missed days of school, and that\u2019s associated with lower performance,\u201d said Pedde. \u201cBut there\u2019s also evidence that air pollution can directly impact the brain and impair cognitive performance.\u201d",
            "Pedde and her colleagues found that those educational performance gains happened only in districts that replaced pre-1990 diesel buses (there are nearly 5,000 pre-1990 buses in the U.S. fleet, her paper estimated). Those that replaced newer diesels saw test-score changes comparable to scores in districts that were not selected for funding to receive cleaner buses. Her research suggests there are greater health benefits from getting the oldest diesel buses off the road than from replacing more recent models, which must meet more stringent emissions standards.",
            "BQLow-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. ",
            "The EPA\u2019s CSB program stipulates that electric buses must be replacing diesel buses from 2010 or earlier. Many state programs have similar requirements. \u201cIn addition to socioeconomic factors, we need to make sure that programs are also targeting the oldest buses,\u201d Pedde said. In Texas, there are at least five school districts still running buses made in the 1970s, according to Keithan.",
            "The CSB program is designed to give preference for new bus funding to the highest-need districts. According to a recent report from the World Resources Institute\u2019s Electric School Bus Initiative, districts with higher shares of low-income households generally have more students riding polluting buses to school than do other districts. The good news is that 74 percent of the grants or rebates awarded to date are in low-income, rural, or tribal school districts, according to the EPA.\n",
            "\u201cThe greatest burden of air quality and health impacts is on students of color, students with disabilities, low-income students,\u201d said Sue Gander, director of WRI\u2019s initiative. \u201cThey are the ones who need to be part of this transition first.\u201d\n",
            "\u201cThe [EPA] policy has led to this desired outcome,\u201d Gander said. \u201cThat\u2019s really encouraging.\u201d But she and other advocates readily acknowledge there\u2019s a long way to go, because low-income and minority communities still have the highest shares of older, polluting diesel buses. And across the nation, only 2.5 percent of all school buses are electric.",

            "There are many reasons for this gap but the biggest is, not surprisingly, money. While a new diesel school bus costs between $125,000 and $150,000, a new electric bus costs between $300,000 and $400,000. And then there are the ancillary costs, including the installation of chargers (which can cost up to $140,000), upgrading transformers and lines to bring power to them, and training employees to manage these new systems.",
            "Even the process of navigating incentive applications can impose prohibitive costs on some school systems. \u201cI don\u2019t have grant writers,\u201d said Kim Raney, executive director of transportation for the Oakland Unified School District. Instead, Raney worked with Zum, a transportation service provider that financed and manages the new fleet, to obtain various EPA and state incentives to make the math work and with the California utility PG&E to install the charging equipment.",
            "While school administrators may want to improve air quality on buses and on school grounds, they are operating under tight fiscal constraints, especially in rural districts, which tend to have not just older buses but also longer routes, meaning students can be exposed to more pollution per mile. Rural districts usually have smaller budgets, making it difficult to hire technical consultants to help apply for grants or rebates, train drivers, and coordinate with utilities to run power to the chargers in their bus yards.",
            "BQThousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant.",
            "And yet some rural districts have made the leap, like one in southern Illinois\u2019 Hardin County, which now operates 12 electric buses in partnership with Highland Fleets, a \u201celectrification-as-a-service\u201d company that helps reduce the cost of going electric for school districts.",
            "Highland purchases the buses, oversees permitting and installation of equipment, trains maintenance staff, maintains the fleet, and pays for the electricity. The company charges school districts a fixed annual fee.",
            "Protecting students\u2019 health is front of mind for many school officials interested in making the transition to electric buses, Gander said. \u201cThere are also clear greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits to electric buses, and a lot of areas with climate plans are motivated by those goals.\u201d But there are other benefits, too. ",
            "Electric buses are much cheaper to operate than diesels: According to a government-funded study published by the National Renewable Energy Lab, they reduce maintenance costs by 44.1 cents per mile compared to their diesel counterparts. Keithan has found that the prospect of saving money is the most persuasive selling point for school administrators with tight budgets, while the health benefits are, she says, icing on the cake.",

            "Another prospective financial benefit for districts is the bus\u2019s capability of feeding power back to the grid, especially during times of peak demand. Thousands of electric school buses with their batteries plugged into the grid could effectively function like a power plant, which can help utilities avoid the expense and pollution of ramping up \u201cpeaker\u201d plants to meet spikes in electricity usage. Pilot programs in Colorado and Massachusetts are currently seeking to demonstrate how electric school buses can provide these \u201cvehicle-to-grid\u201d charging services \u2014 and make money doing so.",
            "Getting more utilities on board to quickly install chargers and deliver power to them is essential, said Matt Stanberry, vice president of Highland Fleets. So is encouraging utilities and state public utility commissions to create special rates and programs to compensate school districts for sending power into the grid when their buses are sitting in the yard, which is about 70 percent of the time during the school year and most of the summer, when many states see peaks in power demand",
            "The Clean School Bus program, which ends in 2026, has awarded nearly $3 billion of its $5 billion total. The EPA is planning to announce a fourth round of funding this fall, offering up to $932 million. But incentives alone can\u2019t push all dirty diesel buses off roads, said Keithan. \u201cThis market has to be able to support itself.\u201d Of course, like other clean energy technologies, electric buses are expected to become more affordable with wider deployment. EPA officials say that they anticipate \u201cthat bus prices will decline as production scales, EV battery costs fall, and more electric buses are deployed.\u201d",
            "BQA month after going fully electric, Oakland\u2019s school bus fleet is working well, the district\u2019s transportation director says.",
            "For districts that struggle to afford new electric buses and have more recent diesel models in their fleet, there are other, less-discussed options: repowering them. The process involves swapping out diesel engines for electric drivetrains, at a cost of between $110,000 and $180,000. It would also prevent older diesels from being sold to poorer districts or being shipped abroad, where they would continue to pollute other children\u2019s lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s a faster way to serve underserved districts, to repower assets they already own,\u201d said Keithan. \u201cIt can be done more quickly, with regional labor, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
            "Despite those advantages, repowers are not that common because districts must ensure their buses comply with federal, state, and city safety regulations, and mechanics willing to do the work may be hard to find. What\u2019s more, repowers aren\u2019t eligible for the EPA\u2019s CSB funding.",
            "Keithan said policymakers should think more broadly and creatively about how to reduce the logistical and financial barriers to accessing this new technology. Making it easier to do repowers and requiring utilities to set aside money for programs that equip schools for charging buses, she said, are two key ways they can accelerate the transition for everyone.",
            "In the meantime, going fully electric may be a \u201cleap of faith,\u201d said Raney, of the Oakland Unified School District, but one well worth taking. A month into the school year, her district\u2019s fleet of new electric buses are working well. And just last week the district performed the first test of its vehicle-to-grid system, with buses sending power back to PG&E for three hours. \u201cIt went off without a hitch,\u201d she said.",
            "Correction, September 12, 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a Hardin County, Illinois, school district is operating 18 electric buses. It is operating 12, as the article now states."

            "With a plan for green infrastructure to drain some 9,500 acres across the city, the Philadelphia Water Department was considered by many to be at the cutting edge of stormwater management \u2014 an increasingly urgent challenge for city governments amid the bigger, more frequent rainstorms now occurring as a result of climate change, especially in the northeastern United States.\n",
            "The program led Philadelphia and other U.S. cities to install nature-based solutions to absorb and filter rainfall alongside traditional \u201cgray infrastructure,\u201d such as pipes, tunnels, and pump stations. Yet while other cities, such as Milwaukee and Boston, saw green measures as complements to gray infrastructure, Philadelphia placed rain gardens and bioswales \u2014 vegetated ditches that collect stormwater \u2014 at the center of its strategy. But now, critics say, these innovations are proving inadequate at handling the increase in extreme rainfall events. In fact, the amount of overflow from pipes that combine stormwater with raw sewage has actually increased since the Green Cities program began.\n",

But its storage tunnels and tanks have done the most to reduce combined sewer overflows into Lake Michigan and local rivers, said Kevin Shafer, the district\u2019s executive director. He estimated that the system\u2019s gray infrastructure can currently handle two and a half to three inches of rain at a time, while green measures can absorb only about half an inch.",

            "Despite its limited finances and aging infrastructure, Milwaukee\u2019s sewerage district has set a goal of eliminating combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by 2035. \u201cWith the changing climate we\u2019re facing,\u201d Shafer has said, \u201cit\u2019s like running uphill, and the hill keeps getting steeper and steeper.\u201d\n",
            "Boston, too, has emphasized gray infrastructure in its efforts to upgrade stormwater management. The city is operating under a long-term control plan \u2014 a federal mandate to reduce CSO volumes until waterways are in compliance with the Clean Water Act, which set a goal for all rivers and creeks to be \u201cfishable and swimmable.\u201d To meet those goals, the city is, little by little, separating stormwater from sewage lines so that rainwater flows into creeks and rivers, leaving only sewage in pipes that lead to treatment plants. The city is also directing stormwater, before it overflows into waterways, into \u201cpartial treatment facilities\u201d that screen out trash and other solids, then disinfect water with high doses of chlorine before discharging it through outfall pipes.\n",

In 2023, for example, Boston received about 55 inches of rain, somewhat more than in a typical year, but some 70 million gallons of combined sewage and stormwater entered the the Charles River, about five times the amount allowed by the long-term control plan.",
            "Last year\u2019s overflows reflect the increasing intensity of downpours that overwhelm wastewater treatment plants, said Rome. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect example of how climate change is changing precipitation. It wasn\u2019t that much wetter, but more of the precipitation fell during a smaller [number] of storms.\u201d\n",
            "In cooperation with the EPA, Boston is now revising its long-term control plan for the lower Charles River watershed with an overflow limit of some 38 million gallons a year, based on 2050\u2019s projected rainfall, said Rome, citing unpublished data from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. That\u2019s above the watershed\u2019s current 13-million-gallon limit but below the actual overflows of the last few years, he says, suggesting that even the revised target will be hard to meet.\n",

When completed later this decade, the system will reduce combined sewer overflows by 96 percent, said Moussa Wone, DC Water\u2019s vice president for the Clean Rivers Program. The volume of CSO outflows into three urban waterways is expected to decline to an average of 138 million gallons a year from 3.2 billion gallons in 1996, and to cut the number of overflows to four from 82 over the same period.",

Recycling rates globally are less than 10 percent. If product design and waste management had gotten together decades ago, we would be in a stronger place now.

Since, the primary carbon source for plastics is petroleum, the major fossil oil and gas producers also see a concern for them. And, of course, some countries might want to strike some things out of the treaty that could be in my view be really important. So we\u2019re going to have to hope that this lands in the right place.

We need to create clothing that sheds less particles, fishing gear and agricultural plastics that are safer. That\u2019s where the real responsibility lies.

            "Such a restitution would right a terrible injustice, executed in the name of conservation. In the 1970s, after the park was established, the government expelled some 6,000 Batwa without consultation from the highland region of the park and revoked their customary land rights. The exiles were left landless and without compensation. To this day, many live in roadside squatter camps, often secretly entering the park to collect firewood, hunt for food, and practice rituals. \n",

But it declined to answer questions from Yale Environment 360 about whether it supports the ruling or will help to implement it.",

Among these hills, there are sacred sites where we communicated with the ancestors and communed with the forest, which we consider to be the nourishing mother. These lands our are identity.

And it calls on the government to adopt into law as soon as possible \u201can effective mechanism for the delimitation, demarcation and titling of the territory traditionally occupied by the Batwa and the various natural resources attached to it in accordance with their tradition,\u201d and to annul all laws \u201cprohibiting the presence of the Batwa on ancestral lands and the enjoyment of the fruits of these lands.\u201d",

The U.S. government subsequently withdrew funding for the organization\u2019s work in the region.",
            "The exposure of such atrocities has come at the same time as evidence has accumulated globally that Indigenous Peoples, often denigrated as forest destroyers, are more usually forest guardians \u2014 more effective conservationists than the park managers who often replace them.",
            "The benefits of their custodianship should not be exaggerated. U.N. agencies and others claim that 80 percent of the world\u2019s biodiversity is in Indigenous territories. A commentary in the journal Nature this month \u2014 signed by Indigenous people and rights activists as well as ecologists \u2014 contends there is no evidence to support this claim. But the authors say their questioning of the statistic should not \u201cdetract from the essential, and verifiably considerable, part that Indigenous Peoples play in the conservation of the planet\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d noting their \u201clands include more than one-third of the world\u2019s intact forest landscapes.\u201d",

Named after the two extinct volcanoes at its heart, it sits within the world\u2019s second largest rainforest, covering the Congo Basin and highlands around the Great Lakes of Central Africa. It covers 2,300 square miles and is home to 14 species of primates, including chimpanzees and one of the last groups of eastern lowland gorillas.

            "But almost since its designation in 1970 and the subsequent expulsion of its Batwa inhabitants, the park has been in trouble. Park guards have been unable to repel repeated incursions from non-Batwa people. These have included Hutu refugees from the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, and militias hiding there during the two civil wars in eastern DRC later that decade. It was during this period that a rapid decline in gorillas and elephants occurred, resulting in UNESCO in 1997 putting the park on its list of endangered World Heritage Sites, where it remains today.",

Park guards failed to evict them. Fergus O\u2019Leary Simpson, a researcher at the University of Antwerp\u2019s Institute of Development Policy, who regularly visits the area, reports local people say that some senior officials of the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN), the government agency that controls the park, are themselves involved in mining and that senior military figures provide weapons to armed groups.",
            "In 2005, the chairman of a Congolese mining company, Cosma Wilungula, was appointed director-general of the ICCN. After 16 years, he was removed from office in 2021 amid allegations of embezzlement. Two years later, the U.S. State Department barred him from entry to the United States on grounds of \u201csignificant corruption.\u201d",
            "Through all this, says Rogers, \u201cthe Batwa are used as scapegoats when illicit activities are discovered in the park.\u201d And when in 2018, after years of failed negotiations with the ICCN aimed at restoring some of their land rights, some 2,000 Batwa returned in family groups to their old villages, there was a fierce reaction from park guards and the military, including the shelling and burning of villages. A subsequent report for the Minority Rights Group concluded that at least 20 Batwa were killed and 15 women raped in attacks over three years.",
            "BQ\u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians,\u201d says a researcher.",
            "An international outcry after the report\u2019s publication triggered a change in management at the park. In 2022, WCS secured a public-private partnership agreement with the DRC government that gave it effective control of the park. WCS set up a management board that included Batwa representation and formally recognized \u201cthe legitimate claims of the Batwa to their remaining ancestral land inside the Park\u201d and the need for \u201cfinding a durable land solution.\u201d",
            "But there is little sign of that solution so far, critics say. \u201cThere is a vast discrepancy between what WCS puts out in public relations statements, and what WCS actually does,\u201d says Rogers. Simpson says the main change since the agreement [WCS was substantially managing before, but with less authority] is that \u201cpark guards have largely ceased patrolling this region for at least two years.\u201d",
            "Simpson resists the idea that restoring Batwa land rights offers a ready conservation solution. \u201cWhile the Batwa have suffered a great injustice, they are no longer living as forest guardians.\u201d He says that some Batwa chiefs within the park collude with the militias, taking money in return for letting them cut trees for firewood and charcoal to sell in nearby urban areas.

The problem, he says, is that the park is full of lootable resources and provides \u201cideal hideouts\u201d for illegal activity. In such a lawless environment, he says, militarized conservation is \u201cthe only feasible form of enforcement.\u201d",
            "But advocates for the Batwa push back strongly against that. They argue the Batwa are the primary victims of the lawlessness, which arises from a corrupt and militarized system of park management. They say the obvious solution \u2014 as concluded by the African Commission \u2014 is the restoration of land rights for the Batwa. But they will need help, agrees Rogers.\n",
            "\u201cDoes the [commission ruling] mean that the Batwa could step back into Kahuzi-Biega and take over as conservation managers tomorrow? Of course not,\u201d she says. \u201cThey will need lots of expert research and consulting, just as do the current managers. They will also need help in dealing with the militias, mining operations, and refugees.\u201d But, Rogers says, \u201cI am completely convinced that their objectives and worldview give them a much better shot at protecting nature.\u201d",
            "BQThe Batwa have so far not been able to benefit from a system for establishing community management of forests. ",
            "Ironically, Rogers points out, the DRC already has a system for establishing community management of forests. Since 2016, communities outside national parks have been allowed to take formal control of up to 120,000 acres of forest around their villages from the government. They are then allowed to exploit those forests according to an agreed management plan.",
            "These concessions have been widely applauded by both conservationists and land-rights NGOs. So far, 200 have been granted, covering more than 11 million acres, including 23 in South Kivu, the DRC province that contains most of the Kahuzi-Biega park\u2019s highlands. But Batwa communities made homeless by exile from the park have so far not been able to benefit. \u201cThe concessions are the best and still probably the only available basis for the Batwa to obtain their rights,\u201d says Joe Eisen, director of the Rainforest Foundation U.K., which runs a database on the community forests.",
            "Rogers agrees that forest concessions are a potentially valuable tool. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t absolve the government agencies, donors, and NGOs of their responsibility to implement the African Commission\u2019s ruling,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the long run, righting the wrongs done to the Batwa is the only way to obtain justice, restore their culture, and protect nature.\u201d"

            "Ozane: There have been studies done by Tulane and LSU, but the studies I\u2019ve seen have been paid for by industry and are biased. The state of Louisiana has said that even though cancer rates are going up, there is no way to say that they\u2019re going up because industry has grown. Louisiana is third in the nation for cancer rates. People hear about Cancer Alley, not understanding that the entire state of Louisiana is a cancer state. I live about three and a half hours from Cancer Alley, and my community is surrounded by more than a dozen petrochemical and gas facilities and three LNG facilities.\n",

            "e360: How does liquid natural gas harm the environment even before it\u2019s burned?",
            "Ozane: LNG is produced by super cooling the gas into a liquid. The process of liquefying releases methane into the atmosphere. And shipping it across the ocean means more tanker traffic and dredging, more pollution, more pollution of our seafood. It\u2019s all for export, while driving up our energy costs here. Natural gas prices in southwest Louisiana are some of the highest in the state.",
            "e360: But it\u2019s bringing jobs and infrastructure?\n",
            "Ozane: They don\u2019t provide the number of jobs they promise, and the folks who are working at those facilities are retiring with cancer. If they\u2019re bringing so many well-paying jobs, why are these communities still in the shape they\u2019re in? Why are people still reaching out to my organization for assistance paying their rent and their light bills?",
            "e360: How much does racism play into all this?",
            "Ozane: Racism plays a big role, because when white and wealthier people were saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want these facilities in our neighborhoods,\u201d they were built in low-income and people-of-color communities. The Vessel Project fought coal in Westlake, Louisiana, and right behind coal came LNG. And right behind LNG, now, you have [new] petrochemical plants. And right behind that is coming CCS [carbon capture and sequestration]. It\u2019s coming to the same communities over and over and over.\n",

            "e360: How much do you make climate change an explicit part of the conversation at Vessel Project?",
            "Ozane: I\u2019ve learned through doing this work that if you want to bring people to the table, you have to be gentle when you\u2019re talking about issues that have been politicized. So we might not necessarily say the words \u201cclimate change,\u201d but people understand that something is wrong when two historical hurricanes come to one area back-to-back. And that\u2019s followed by a flood, and that\u2019s followed by a freeze, and they\u2019re pushed out.",
            "You\u2019re talking about a red state in the South, so we try to keep those types of words out of the conversation and instead teach people that your environment starts with your body. If you\u2019re not breathing clean air and clean water, you\u2019re not healthy. You\u2019re not going to feel well, which contributes to you not wanting to go to work, not being able to be your best self. We talk about industrial pollution, methane emissions. We can have a crawfish boil and we talk about the fact that we had less crawfish this year than last year. And somebody in the audience is going to say, \u201cThat\u2019s because of climate change.\u201d We don\u2019t have to put it on the flyer that we\u2019re talking about climate change, but because we\u2019re connecting the dots, people get it.",

            "Ozane: We\u2019re pushing them to speed things up. Because we don\u2019t know how this election is going to go. We\u2019re hoping people will vote on the issues that are going to save their communities. We need the Biden administration to be in office again to make sure that the policies he\u2019s enacting are turned into bedrock legislation. The state of Louisiana just had a judge try to overturn the LNG pause. The FERC approved this permit for CP2, fully knowing it can\u2019t go anywhere without its DOE permit. [With the Sierra Club and the NRDC] we\u2019re taking all the necessary steps to bring this to court and get this permit thrown out. ",
            "e360: To what extent are your activities now focused on the national level?\n",
            "Ozane: In the short term, I\u2019m focused on elections at home, in Louisiana. I am trying to make sure that people in communities that look like mine are registered to vote, are educated on the issues. On the national level, I\u2019m trying to go to states that have communities that look like mine to connect these issues so that people know these are not one-offs. Cancer Alley in Louisiana is not the only Cancer Alley in the United States. Other communities that look like mine are overrun with polluted air, polluted water. Flint, Michigan\u2019s water crisis is also happening in Sulphur, Louisiana. There\u2019s a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi. We need to start talking about how these issues are connected, how the people in these communities all look alike, and why they\u2019ve been sacrificed for so long.\n",
            "e360: Given the latest developments on CP2, how do you maintain your optimism?",
            "Ozane: Every morning when I wake up, I see my children, and they have this happiness, these smiles. And let me tell you, my children are not hidden from this. If you look back at our Climate Week post, you\u2019ll see my children on the frontlines holding banners. But the fact that they still get up every day smiling, laughing, knowing the fight ahead, it gives me hope. Because I know that if I don\u2019t live to see any of what I\u2019m fighting for come to fruition, I am raising the next generation of environmental activists, of climate activists, and the fight will continue until we win.\n",
